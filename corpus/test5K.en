Known as Sesshu (1420 - 1506), he was an ink painter and Zen monk active in the Muromachi period in the latter half of the 15th century, and was called a master painter.
He revolutionized the Japanese ink painting.
He was given the posthumous name "Toyo" or "Sesshu (拙宗)."
Born in Bicchu Province, he moved to Suo Province after entering SShokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto.
Later he accompanied a mission to Ming Dynasty China and learned Chinese ink painting.
His works were many, including not only Chinese-style landscape paintings, but also portraits and pictures of flowers and birds.
His bold compositions and strong brush strokes constituted an extremely distinctive style.
6 of his extant works are designated national treasures. Indeed, he is considered to be extraordinary among Japanese painters.
For this reason, there are a great many artworks that are attributed to him, such as folding screens with pictures of flowers and that birds are painted on them.
There are many works that even experts cannot agree if they are really his work or not.
Representative works include: Long Landscape Scroll, Summer and Winter Landscape, View of Amanohashidate, Broken Ink Landscape, Portrait of Ekadanpi, Fall and Winter Landscape, and Folding Screen of Birds and Flowers of the 4 Seasons.
His disciples include Shugetsu, Soen, and Toshun.
He was born in Akahama, Bicchu Province (present-day Soja City, Okayama Prefecture), in 1420.
He was born to a Samurai family called ODA.
He entered nearby Hofuku-ji Temple (Soja City) while young.
He moved to Kyoto's Shokoku-ji Temple at the age of around 10, and while studying and having Zen training under Shuto SHUNRIN, learned painting from Shubun TENSHO.
In around 1454, he moved to Suo Province, and built his studio, Unkokuan (Yamaguchi City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), with the patronage of the feudal lord, Ouchi.
In around 1465, he acquired a calligraphy work by Bonki SOSEKI on which the characters of Sesshu were written, and requested Shinkei RYUKO to write a certificate about the origin of the name, Sesshu.
It is believed that after that, he came to be known as Sesshuu.
It is thought that until this time he was known as Touyou SESSHU, but there is not a firm source to indicate that SESSHU and Sesshu were the same person.
In 1468, he sailed to Ming Dynasty China with a mission.
He familiarized himself with authentic Chinese ink painting and studied it for about 2 years.
In the fall of 1481, he traveled to Mino Province.
There is no reliable record of the date of his death, but most put it at 1506.
Other records write that he died in 1502.
In addition to the date of his death, there are many other aspects of Sesshu's life that remain unknown.
There is an interesting episode about Sesshu.
A young Sesshu who entered Hofuku-ji Temple only liked pictures and did not want to read sutras; so the monks of the temple tied him to a pillar in the building enshrining a Buddhist statue.
However, when the monks saw that he drew a rat with his tears that fell on the floor by using his big toe, they were impressed so they allowed him to draw pictures.
This is thought to be the most well known story about Sesshu.
The story first appeared in "Honcho Gashi" compiled by Eino KANO (published in 1693, the Edo period).
Sesshu started to be deified in the Edo period.
It is thought to be because the Kano School that ruled painting circles at the time venerated him as a master, and feudal lords wanted to have Sesshu's artwork.
It is said that this is why the number of artworks attributed to Sesshu increased.
Reflecting Sesshu's popularity, a Japanese puppet drama/Kabuki work entitled "The Gion Religious Festival" was created.
The drama was first performed in January 1758.
The scene of Kinkaku-ji Temple, where Sesshu's granddaughter, Yukihime, takes an active role, is famous) and similar works were performed.
Today, Sesshu who gave birth to one of Japanese cultures is a leading historical figure of this country.

Soujun IKKYUU was a Zen monk in the Daitokuji branch of the Rinzai sect, during the Muromachi period.
He is known as a character in stories.
For IKKYUU's Witty Sayings refer to the section on "IKYUU's Sayings" (also some on this page); for the TV cartoon "Ikkyuu-san", refer to the section on "Ikyuu-san".
Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Gokomatsu.
In Kazunaga SUGAWARA's diary, "Higashiboujou Kazunaga Kyouki", he wrote on August 1st of 1494 that "it is said in secret that the monk IKKYUU is a prince, the illegitimate child of Gokomatsu.
Nobody in the world knows this."
According to later historical documents, his childhood name was Sengikumaru.
Called Shuuken for a long time, he also went by Kyouunshi, Katsuro, and Mukei.
Soujun was his Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name), also written as Soujun.
IKKYUU was his Dougou (monk's name).
(Refer to the section on "Kaimyo" for Kaimyo and Dougou.)
He took orders under Shuukan SHOUGE at Kyoto's Ankokuji at the age of 6, and was named Shuuken.
He quickly developed a talent for poetry; and his poems "Choumonshunsou", which he wrote at 13, and "Shunishukka", which he wrote at 15 years of age, were praised throughout Kyoto.
In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a student of Soui KENOU and changed his name to Soujun.
KENOU died in 1414.
Whether it was because of the death of his teacher is difficult to determine, but IKKYUU attempted suicide around that time.
In 1415 he became a student of high priest Soudon KASOU at Kyoto's Daitokuji.
He received the name IKKYUU from KASOU when he answered the Koan called Touzan's 3 Blows by saying "the treacherous path returns to the safe path; take a rest and let the rain fall, let the wind blow."
The "treacherous path" refers to the world of confusion (distracting thoughts), while the "safe path" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha).
One night in 1420 he heard the calling of a crow, and was immediately enlightened.
KASOU tried to give him a certificate of dharma transmission, but IKKYUU refused it.
It is said that KASOU laughed and called him a fool as he sent him away.
From then on he lived a crazy life of poetry, writing, and painting.
In 1428 Emperor Shoukou died without leaving behind a son; and Emperor Gohanazono from the Fushiminomiya family was enthroned.
It is said that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement was based on a recommendation from IKKYUU.
From "A chronological history of the Priest Ikkyuu of Toukai".
Actually, Yoshio IMAIZUMI says that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement had the support of the shogunate, and had nothing to do with IKKYUU's recommendation.
After the Onin War in 1474, at the order of Emperor Gotsuchimikado he was installed as chief priest (the 47th) of Daitokuji; and although he did not live in the temple, he put a lot of effort into its restoration.
The subsidiary temple Shinjuan was built with IKKYUU as its founder.
He was close to the emperor, and was also loved by the people.
He died at Shuuonan in 1481, at the age of 88.
It is reported that on his deathbed he said, "I don't want to die."
Shuuonan, commonly called "Ikkyuuji", is located in the Takigi area of Kyoutanabe City in Kyoto.
The ruined Myoushouji temple was restored by IKKYUU in 1456.
His grave is at Shuuonan and is called Jiyoutou, but is managed by the Imperial Household Agency as an imperial tomb, calling it the grave of prince Soujun, son of Emperor Gokomatsu, based on the stories about his lineage.
For that reason it is not open to the public.
Free and uninhibited, he was said to have many eccentricities.
The following anecdotes have been passed on.
He threw his certificate of dharma transmission and other valuable texts into a fire.
Besides homosexuality, he did things that are forbidden in Buddhism, such as drinking liquor, eating meat, and cavorting with women, had a mistress called Shinjisha, and one of his students was a son of his named Shoutei KIOU.
He walked about town in peculiar attire, such as with a wooden sword in a red lacquer sheath.
One day while Rennyo, the master of Honganji and also his friend, was out, he went into his room and took a nap on Rennyo's statue of the Amitabha.
Upon returning home to see this, Rennyo said, "what are you doing to my tools of trades?"
At the new year, he stuck a skull on top of a cane, and walked around yelling, "beware, beware."
This kind of action seems strange at first, but has something in common with such famous Tang dynasty Chinese Rinzai priests as Fuke, and as a teaching style is an expression of the eccentric spirit of Zen.
At the same time, it was also a way to criticize and satirize the decline Buddhism, and the growth of an authoritarian strain, and to raise an alarm at the wearing down and ossification of Buddhism.
This can also be understood from the sermon, "7 Buddhas Tsuukaige", which he wrote himself.
This kind of starkly human lifestyle, without concern for rules or formality, gained him sympathy from the masses, and in the Edo Period became the basis for collections of witty stories such as "Ikkyuu's Sayings".
IKKYUU was known as a skilled calligrapher.
It is said that IKKYUU was Jukou MURATA's teacher, and his writings were prized most highly among practitioners of the tea ceremony.
(Recent research has cast doubt upon the tales of IKKYUU being Jukou's teacher.)
His writings (poetry collections) include "Kyouunshuu", "Kyouunshuu Continued", "Jikaishuu", and "Skeleton".
He is representative of the Higashiyama culture.
He is known to have criticized the shogunate of Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA and his wife Tomiko HINO.

Woman is the storehouse of the dharma; she bears Buddha and Bodhidharma alike.
According to Antonio INOKI and others, the words attributed to IKKYUU that begin with "what will happen if I go down this path..." are not actually his words, but are actually from Tetsuo KIYOZAWA's poem "The Path"; although there is some confusion about the source.

Biography
Many stories recall that he was a quick-witted little monk in his childhood, and made a name for himself by doing difficult training in his youth.
This aspect is especially emphasized in the stories aimed at children.
Many of the stories feature him as a child getting one over on a priest or Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA with his witty remarks.
Such stories combine elements from "Ikkyuu's Sayings" with the real Soujun IKKYUU; and as far as his childhood goes, is far from historically accurate; it is probably done to get readers involved in the story, as it only gets into more difficult reading in the episodes from his youth onward.
Some accounts do not explicitly state the child IKKYUU's name or birth, or the names of temples.
"Ikkyuu's Sayings"
Known as "Ikkyuu-san's Witty Stories", these appeared in the Genroku Period (the first half year of the Edo era), over 200 years after IKKYUU's death.
The author is unknown.
Because "Ikkyuu's Sayings" includes, in addition to IKKYUU's deeds, many characters and folk stories in which IKKYUU has been substituted for other monks, it cannot be called historically accurate.
It is a book in which a historical figure has been imbued with the people's desires.
"Ikkyuu's Sayings" is beloved today as a children's book; and there has been a television cartoon adaptation, "Ikkyuu-san".
Through this story, many children have learned about Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, Rokuonji, and the Muromachi Period before ever going to history class.
Amida triad is one style to place a Buddhist image in Buddhism.
It is a triad style and consists of Amida-Nyorai, i.e., Amitabha Buddha at the center and two attendants, Kannon-Bosatsu, i.e., Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva on the left and Seishi-Bosatsu, i.e., Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva on the right.
(The "left"or "right" in this case is the direction seen from Amida-Nyorai.)
Kannon-Bosatsu is said to be the embodiment of the Amida's mercy and Seishi-Bosatsu is that of the Amida's wisdom.
The Kannon's crown displays kebustu, a small image of Amida, while the Seishi has suihei, a small water bottle, so you can tell one from the other with ease relatively.
In Japan, ancient examples are: The Amida triad made of bronze owned by the Tokyo National Museum, once dedicated to the Horyuji Temple as one of 48 Buddhist images (important cultural property), and the Amida triad also made of bronze enshrined in the Lady Tachibana's Shrine of Horyuji Temple (national treasure).
There are various forms of triads: Amida is seated in the center with statues on both sides standing (e.g. the triad in the Ninnaji Temple in Kyoto), all three statues are standing with Amida in the center (e.g. the triad in the Jodoji Temple in Hyogo), all three statues are seated with Amida in the center(e.g. the triad in the Seiryoji Temple in Kyoto), or Amida seated in the center and the other two statues are kneeling down (e.g. the triad in the Sanzenin Temple in Kyoto).
The triad with Amida seated at the center and the other two kneeling down on both sides is a form of Raigo, which means inviting the dead spirits to heaven. The left Bodhisattvas Kannon in this triad usually has a rendai, a lotus-flower-shaped pedestal to carry the dead.
There exists another formation made of 5 statues that includes Jizo-Bosatsu, i.e., Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, and Ryujyu-Bosatsu, i.e., Naagaarjuna Bodhisattva.

Shinran was a Japanese Buddhist monk in the early Kamakura period.
He is recognized as the founder of Jodo Shinshu, or Shin Buddhism.
On November 28th, 1876, Shinran was given the posthumous Buddhist name Kenshin Daishi by Emperor Meiji.
After Shinran met Honen (the founder of Jodo Shu) and became his disciple, he inherited 'the discipline of the true religion, Jodo Shu', making all efforts to enhance it.
He doesn't seem to have intended to establish his own sect.
He didn't possess his own temple, but constructed meeting places called Nenbutsu Dojo in various provinces to spread the teaching of Jodo Shinshu.
While Shinran's nenbutsu group was censured by the Buddhist establishment and the other sects of Jodo Shu, a distinctive character of his discipline became clear, so his followers established a new sect, Jodo Shinshu, after his death.
Jodo Shinshu is considered to have been founded in 1247, when Shinran finished writing "Kenjodo shinjitsu kyogyo shomonrui" (Kyogyo shinsho), but in reality it was after Shinran's death that Jodo Shinshu was officially recognized.
The Seven Patriarchs of Jodo Shinshu: Shinran selected the following 7 monks as the high priests who had taught and spread the doctrine of Shomyo Nenbutsu.

Japanese Buddhism
Genshin: "Ojoyoshu" (treatises on rebirth)"
Genku Sho'nin (Honen Sho'nin): "Senjaku Hongan Nenbutsu Shu" (treatises on the Great Vow)" (Singled-Out Collection)
Prince Shotoku: Shinran revered Prince Shotoku as "Wakoku-no-kyoshu" (the founder of Japanese Buddhism) and worshiped him as an incarnation of Kannon Bosatsu (Bodhisattva).
"Seventeen-article constitution"
Honen set the following three books as the canon, which were preached by Sakyamuni and generically called 'Three Pure Land Sutras': "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo", "Kammuryoju-kyo" and "Amida-kyo."
The book "Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo" was also called "Daimuryoju-kyo" (Daikyo), and considered the most significant sutra by Shinran.
In the teaching of Jodo Shinshu, those who awaken faith in the saving grace of Amida Nyorai and express deep feeling of gratitude by reciting his name "Namu Amida Butsu," are to be reborn in the Pure Land of Amida and become a Buddha.
Because long time ago Hozo bosatsu (Amida Butsu when he was still studying) invoked the forty-eight vows, and the main idea of the eighteenth vow (called the Great Vow) had been 'if any one is not saved in this world, I shall not attain Buddhahood', and then he became a Buddha with all his vows fulfilled.
It is the Great Vow of Amida Butsu that leads all the people (sentient beings) to the Pure Land, and the path to the Pure Land will open by the faith which is given by Amida Butsu (Easy Path).
This is called Shinji Shoin Shomyo Ho-on (meaning only the belief given by Amida Butsu leads you to the Pure Land, so you have to recite the name of Amida Butsu to express the feeling of gratitude).
As mentioned before, the faith in this context isn't the faith given by people's own efforts, but it is Amida Butsu who gives them the faith, and everything that happens in this world is due to the work of Amida Butsu.
This viewpoint is called "Tariki Hongan," which means salvation through the benevolence of Amida Butsu.
In the teaching of Jodo Shinshu, all people (sentient beings) are considered creatures who don't have wisdom like Buddha and have to live through the degenerate age of Mappo.
However, the teaching doesn't necessarily deny those who try to attain enlightenment by themselves (or those who try to choose the Difficult Path).
Shinran also wrote in his book "Shoshinge" that it is really difficult to keep holding your faith without any misunderstandings.
"Tariki" means the work or power of Amidabutsu.
Therefore the devoted followers of Jodo Shinshu choose not to use the word "tariki" in such contexts like 'you depend on the other people too much', or 'it is due to the work of sun, rain, wind, air or other nature', because the true meaning of "tariki" is not the influence of people or nature but Amidabutsu, though this misusage is pervasive now.
The idea called "Akunin Shoki" is also unique to Shinran.
This is something you can see in the thinking of Honen, who was Shinran's teacher, but it is also said that Shinran organized the idea as a doctrine.
In the book "Tannisho" is written that 'if even good people can be born in the Pure Land, how much more so the evil people', and this has also something to do with the concept of "Tariki Hongan," which was mentioned above. The meaning of this is that people (sentient beings) are too ignorant to do something good that leads to the Pure Land.
People (sentient beings) always do evil things, which never leads them to the Pure Land.
So, paradoxically, those who know they are evil are closer to the path to salvation by the Great Vow, rather than those who consider themselves good and still believe that they can do something good.
It could be said an extension of the idea of not-self, or Anatta in Mahayana Buddhism.
Shinran thought that we are all Gensho shojoju, which means we are saved by the Great Vow of Amida Butsu and already destined to go to the Pure Land, so he decided to live in this world illustrating how much his life is filled with joy and happiness derived from the life in the Pure Land.
This idea goes beyond that of Honen, and is one of the significant doctrinal differences between Jodo Shinshu and Jodo shu.
All the ages below are according to the East Asian age reckoning.
All the dates and years below are according to the Japanese lunar calendar, in order to show the accurate date and be able to identify the dates when the books are written.
On April 1st, 1173 (according to the solar calendar, May 21st), Shinran was born the first son of Arinori HINO, whose title was Daishin of the emperor's mother, near the present Hino Tanjo-in in the Hokai-ji Temple (Hino, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City).
His mother is recognized to be Kikko'nyo, granddaughter of Hachimantaro Yoshiie (=MINAMOTO no Yoshiie) of the Seiwa Genji clan.
His name as a child was Matsuwakamaro or Matsuwakamaru.
In 1181, when Shinran was 9, he was inducted into the Buddhist priesthood by Jien (who later became a chief abbot called Tendai Zasu) at a Buddhist monastery called Shoren-in, and given the Buddhist name Hannen.
After he entered the priesthood, he went to Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei and stayed at the training center called Jogyodo in the Shuryogon-in in Yokawa, where his master Jien served as Kengyo. He pursued his study and disciplined himself as a monk of the Tendai sect according to its religious practice of Fudan Nenbutsu.
He served for 20 years on Mt. Hiei, but he came to realize the limitations of Self-power.
Around the spring of 1201, when Shinran was 29, he left Mt. Hiei and for the purpose of praying for the coming generations he went to Choho-ji Temple (located in present Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto City), which was founded by Prince Shotoku, and secluded himself for 100 days there.
On the 95th day of his seclusion (April 5th of the same year), he had a dream in which Prince Shotoku (or Kannon Bosatsu's incarnation) appeared and said, "If you have sexual intercourse because of your previous karma, I will take your sin instead becoming the woman for you.
Serve the temple earnestly through your life, and I will lead you to the Pure Land at your death."
Shinran followed the prophetic dream, and as dawn broke he visited Honen, who had lived in Higashiyama Yoshimizu (present Maruyama-cho, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto City).
(Honen was 69 then.)
Shinran moved in a thatched hut in Okazaki (present Okazaki Higashitenno-cho, Sakyo-ku), and visited Honen for 100 days to listen to his teaching.
Shinran decided to become Honen's disciple when he learned Honen's teaching of "Exclusive Nenbutsu".
Then Shinran was given a new Buddhist name, "Shakku", by Honen.
Shinran studied hard, and gradually earned the respect of his master Honen.
On April 14th, 1205, (5 years later of Shinran's becoming Honen's disciple), Honen permitted Shinran to make a copy of his work, "Senjaku Hongan Nenbutsushu" (Singled-out Collection) and draw a portrait of Him.
This was a privilege reserved for only a select few disciples.
At about this time, Shinran asked Honen to change his name, and was given the name "Zenshin".
It is said that during his study under Honen, Shinran got married with either Tamahi, daughter of Kanezane KUJO, or Eshinni, daughter of the Miyoshi clan.
At that time, it was common to allow exiled criminals to marry, and this interpretation is supported even today.
There are many stories about Shinran's marriage, such as the idea that Tamahi and Eshinni were the same person.
In the illustrated biography of Shinran called Hongan-ji Sho'nin Denne, the painting of 'Entering Yoshimizu Temple' is followed by that of 'The Oracle at Rokkakudo', but the book of "Eshinni shosoku" says, 'Shinran made ceaseless visits to the master Honen for 100 days, and it was just like his seclusion at the Rokkakudo, which lasted for 100 days,....'
Generally speaking, the descriptions about these events in the book of "Godensho" are considered Kaku'nyo's miswriting.
Besides that, some handwritten copies of the book say "The Oracle at Rokkakudo" and "Entering Yoshimizu Temple" were events that happened in 1626, but they are also considered errors in writing.
(The West Hongan-ji Temple version of the book says only "The Oracle at Rokkakudo" took place in 1626.)
In February, 1207, at the protest of Kofuku-ji Temple, Honen's "Exclusive Nenbutsu" was suppressed, and 4 people including Junsai were executed, and 8 people including Honen and Shinran were to be banished (this incident is called Jogen no Honan).
Honen and Shinran were deprived of their Buddhist names then.
Honen was given the nonclerical name "Motohiko FUJII", and Shinran "Yoshizane FUJII".
Honen was banished to Tosa Province (present Kochi Prefecture), and Shinran to Echigo Kokufu (present Niigata Prefecture).
Partly because the letters of his Buddhist name Zenshin were used in the secular name Yoshizane, he called himself "Gutokusha Shinran" (Gutokusha means a foolish bald man), borrowing the Shin from India's Tenshin Bosatsu and the Ran from Unran Daishi, and began to lead a life of "Hiso Hizoku" (neither monk nor layman).
Some accounts have it that at about this time Shinran got married to Eshinni, daughter of the strong warrior Tamenori MIYOHI.
Also, he is said to have had a baby in exile.
In November, 1211 (5 years after his exile), the court issued an order to pardon Shinran and Honen.
On January 25th, 1212, Honen died in Kyoto at the age of 80.
So Shinran never met his master again.
Partly because of this, Shinran didn't return to Kyoto and remained in Echigo.
In 1214 (three years after the pardon), Shinran left Echigo with his family and some disciples such as Shoshin to preach his teachings to the people in the Kanto region, and they made their way from the Zenko-ji Temple in Shinano Province, through Sanuki no sho in Kozuke Province to Hitachi (present northeast area of Ibaraki Prefecture).
In 1216, Shinran began to build thatched huts such as "Oyama no soan" (located in present Shirosatomachi, Ibaraki Prefecture), "Kojima no soan" (located in present Ojima, Shimotsuma-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture) and "Inada no soan" in Inada no go (present Inada, Kasama-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture).
He settled at Hitachi Province and spread his teachings vigorously to the people there.
His missionary work in the Kanto region lasted about 20 years.
It is also said that Shinran spent 4 years on writing a rough draft of his main work "Kenjodo shinjitsu kyogyo shomonrui" (Kyogyo shinsho) at his thatched hut in Inada.
According to the Sainen-ji Temple's story, Shinran's wife Eshinni didn't accompany him to Kyoto and remained in "Inada no soan" until her death.
Shinran's 24 leading disciples in the Kanto region came to be called "Kanto twenty-four followers of Shinran" in later days.
These disciples founded temples in the area of Hitachi, Shimotsuke and so on.
The number of the temples founded by the Kanto followers are now 43, and they survive to this day being called "Temples founded by twenty-four followers of Shinran".
In 1234, the Kamakura shogunate declared a ban on Nenbutsu practitioners.
That is why Shinran made his way to Kyoto at the age of 62 or 63.
After his return to Kyoto, he began to devote himself to writing books.
After Shinran left Hitachi Province, various heresies and misinterpretations of his teachings to arose.
Around 1247, when Shinran was about 75, he completed his work "Kyogyo shinsho", which Shinran had been revising and supplementing for a long time, and he allowed his disciple Sonren to copy his book.
In 1248, he completed these two books of "Jodo wasan" and "Koso wasan".
In 1250, he completed "Yuishinsho mon'i" (preserved in the Morioka Honsei-ji Temple).
In 1251, Shinran sent a letter to pacify a dispute called "Unen-munen no jo," which happened in Hitachi Province.
In 1252, he completed "Jodo monruijusho".
Around 1253, Shinran sent his son Zenran and his grandson Nyoshin to the Kanto region in order to spread an authentic doctrine to people.
However, Zenran devoted himself to the wrong doctrine called "Senju kenzen", and he preached the heresy even to the people who had understood Shinran's teachings properly, causing a turmoil.
Nyoshin kept preaching Shinran's teachings to the people at Oami, Mutsu Province, and gained a large number of disciples called "Oami monto".
In 1254, it is said that Eshinni asked her youngest daughter Kakushinni to take care of Shinran, and she left for her hometown Echigo.
The reason she returned home was to take care of her relatives and the lands of the Miyoshi family to which she was born.
In 1255, he completed "Songo shinzo meimon" (an abstract/ preserved in the Houn-ji Temple in Fukui Prefecture), "Jodo sangyo ojo monrui" (an abstract/ Kencho version), "Gutokusho" (2 vols.) and "Kotaishi Shotoku hosan" (75 poems).
In 1256, he completed "Nyushutsu nimonge" (hymns on the two gates, entrance and exit) (preserved in the Houn-ji Temple in Fukui Prefecture).
Shinran declared that he would disown his son Zenran in his letter dated May 29th of that year, because Zenran preached heresy to the people in the Kanto region.
It is thought that the visit to the Kanto followers mentioned in the second chapter of the "Tannisho" took place around this time.
In 1256, Shinran completed "Nyorai nishu ekomon" (Osoeko Gensoeko monrui).
In 1257, he completed "Ichinen tanen mon'i (means notes on one-thought and many-thoughts)" and "Dainihonkoku zokusan'o shotoku taishi hosan", and made a copy of "Jodo sangyo ojomonrui" (longer version/Kogen version).
In 1258, he completed "Songo shinzo meimon" (longer version) and "Shozomatsu wasan".
The three books "Jodo wasan", "Koso wasan" and "Shozomatsu wasan" as a set are called 'Sanjo wasan'.
The letters written by Shinran around this time were later compiled into the books of "Mattosho" (compiled by Jukaku) and "Shinran Sho'nin goshosokushu" (compiled by Zensho).
On January 16th, 1263, he died at the age of 90 (according to the East Asian age reckoning, and 89 in a regular way of counting) in "Zenpo-in" at Oshikoji Minami and Madenokoji Higashi (his younger brother Jin'u served as a chief monk there).
There are various explanations as to the place of his death, "Zenpo-in (Zenpo-bo) at Oshikoji Minami/Madenokoji Higashi."
The Hongan-ji sect said that "Zenpo-bo" was at the west side of Madenokoji, and restored Zenpo-in (present-day Hongan-ji Sect Kadonobo Annex).
The Otani Sect supposed the location of "Zenpo-in" to be at the ruins of Hosen-ji Temple, built in a place that had come to be called "Shinrangahara" (present-day Kyoto Municipal Kyoto Oike Middle School - Toraishi-cho), and erected a stone monument with the words "The Place Where Kenshin Daishi Passed On."
(Some also say that he passed on at Koen-ji Temple (Kyoto City Shimogyo Ward) and his body was moved to Zenpo-in for some reason.)
At his death, Shinran's younger brother Jin'u and his youngest daughter Kakushinni, among others, were with him.
His ashes were interred at "Otani", north of Toribeno.
Since his exile, he had stuck to his own status which was neither a monk nor a layman.
The ritual called "Ho-onko" for expressing the feeling of gratitude to Shinran takes place on the date of his death annually.
According to the book of "Godensho" written by the 3rd caretaker of Hongan-ji Temple Kakunyo, 'his cremation was held at Ennin-ji Temple, south of Toribeno.'
The Hongan-ji sect says that he was cremated around the south side of Mt. Toribe (present-day Otani Honbyo/Nishi Otani Ondabisho).
The Otani sect says that he was cremated at Enni-ji Temple (Imakumano, Kyoto City Higashi Ward).
(Present-day Enni-ji Temple was restored by the 21st chief priest of Higashi Hongan-ji, Kosho OTANI.)
Some belongings left by Shinran and a part of his skull were carried to the Kanto region by disciples such as Zensho, and placed into the "Inada no soan" in which Shinran lived while preaching in the Kanto region.
A statue of Shinran at
In 1272 (10 years after Shinran's death), with the help of Shinran's followers, Kakushinni moved the tomb of Shinran at "Otani" to the north of Yoshimizu (near the present Sotai-in (Chion-in Tacchu)) and constructed a hall called "Otani byodo."
(In 1295, Shinran's image was enshrined in the hall, which came to be called "Otani eido".)
(In 1312, he posted the name "Senju-ji," but the people of Enryaku-ji Temple opposed it and the name was taken down.)
Hongan-ji Temple survived until 1465 (the time of the 8th caretaker, Rennyo), when it was destroyed by the congregation from the Saito area of Enryaku-ji Temple (the incident is called Kansho no Honan).

Jodo Shu is one of the denominations of Buddhism in Japan, which was founded by Honen Shonin and the teaching and practice of which is Jodo Kyo Senju-nenbutsu (Exclusive Nenbutsu).
Honzon (main image) is Amida Nyorai (Funagokoryumida).
Honen swore to be a monk, following the will of his father, URUMA no Tokikuni.
He was sent to his uncle's temple, Bodai-ji, before he went to Mt. Hiei, the center of Buddhist study.
He studied hard under Kangaku Shonin there.
But after four years, his teacher monk Kangaku Shonin said to Seishimaru 'I have nothing to teach you any more. How about going to study at Mt. Hiei?', so he went to Mt. Hiei in 1145, when he was only 13 years old.
After that he learned Buddhism under Genko Shonin at Eizan Komponchudo.
After Seishimaru had learned everything Genko Shonin could have taught, he started to study under Koen Ajari.
Seishimaru was ordained officially by Koen in 1147, when he was 15.
In 1150 (18 years old), Seishimaru moved to Bessho of Seiryu-ji Temple (in Sakamoto, Otsu city), was taught by Jigenbo Eiku Shonin, named Honen-bo Genku (used one Kanji character each from Genko and Eiko).
In 1175, when he was 43, Honen realized the truth of Senju-nenbutsu by Kanmuryojukyosho (Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra), written by Zendo Daishi, so he left Mt. Hiei for Higashiyama Yoshimizu and began to spread the teaching of the nenbutsu.
It is said that this is the beginning of Jodo Shu.
The words of Kangyosho, which made Honen found Jodo Shu are:
The way of Ojo (birth in the Pure Land) is to continue to recite the name of Mida (Amida) intently whenever and wherever, regardless of length of time.
That is because it leads to the true wish of Mida.
Recite the name of Mida intently.
Whenever and wherever, it doesn't matter how long you recite.
Continue to recite the name of Mida and it is the true way for Ojo.
That is because it leads to the true wish of Mida.
"Namu Amida Butsu" means to believe in Amida Butsu.
It is said the nenbustu of Jodo Shu began with the selection of these words, Mida Butsu.
"Senchaku Hongan nenbutsu Shu" (Passages on the Selection of the nenbutsu in the Original Vow) is the main sacred book, which is a compilation of dogma.
When Honen founded Jodo Shu, he was criticized by old temples such as Tendai denomination and Kofuku-ji temple of Nara, and exiled to Sanuki province (Jogen persecution), but he propagated Jodo Shu there as well.
After that he was pardoned but forbidden to enter Kyoto, so he continued to propagation based at Katsuo-ji Temple in Settsu Province.
Honen was allowed to come back to Kyoto in 1211(Kenreki 1), but passed away at the age of 80 next year.
History
After Honen passed away, Shinku, an elder disciple, succeeded the Jodo Shu denomination, but there were subtle differences in the interpretation of the dogma of Honen between disciples such as Shoku, Bencho, Kosai, Chosai, Ryukan and Shinran.
In 1227, Senju-nenbutsu was forbidden again, and Jodo Shu was damaged heavily and moved toward separation (Karoku persecution).
The reason for this persecution was that nenbutsu priests were suspected of robbery when the treasure of Hossho-ji Temple was stolen.
In addition, monks of Enryaku-ji Temple attacked nenbutsu priests, "Senchaku Hongan nenbutsu Shu (Passages on the Selection of the nenbutsu in the Original Vow)" was banned, and Honen's mausoleum at Higashiyama Otani (Kyoto) was destroyed.
At this time Kosai was exiled to Iki Province and Ryukan to Mutsu Province as well.
Honen's body was accepted by Raigo Enku of Uzumasa Koryu-ji Temple and cremated at Ao'no in Nishiyama.
After that, Jodo shiryu (four sects of Jodo Shu) were founded.
That is the four sects that were the mainstream of Jodo Shu after Shinku's death, Seizan-gi of Shoku, Chinzei-gi of Bencho who was patronized by the Kusano clan in Kyushu, Chorakuji-gi of Ryukan who spread Tanen-gi in Eastern area after exile there, Kuhonji-gi of Chosei who taught Shogyohongan-gi against Shoku in Kyoto.
These four sects do not include Shinran's sect, one of the strongest sects at that time, which became independent as Jodo Shinshu after he died. Other independent sects were founded left and right by other priests such as Tanku of Nison-in Temple in Saga (Kyoto), Genchi who revived Chion-in Temple and Kosei who introduced Ichinen-gi.
But only Seizan-gi and Chinzei-gi remained through the Middle ages, other than Jodo Shinshu, and they were called Seizan School and Chinzei School.
On the other hand, the Kamakura Shogunate oppressed Jodo Shu to stop nenbutsu in Kamakura, but Seizan-ha was welcomed by Hojo clan later and built a base in Bengayatasu of Kamakura.
Moreover, Ryochu, who was a disciple of Bencho, founder of Chinzei-ha, had established his influence in Kanto area based on Goshin-ji Temple (present Komyo-ji Temple in Kamakura city).
Gokuraku-ji Temple in Kamakura (Kamakura city) was said to have been a Jodo Shu Temple before becoming a Shingon-risshu temple, and Kotoku-in (Kamakura Daibutsu) is a representative Jodo Shu temple in Kamakura (it is said that it was in the Edo period that it officially became a Jodo Shu Temple, there are various opinions about the early period.
But Jodo Shu fell into an era of separation; Nishiyama-ha separated to Nishitani-ryu, Fukakusa-ryu, Higashiyama-ryu and Saga-ryu after Shoku died, and Chinzei-ha separated into Shirohata-ha, Nagoe-ha, Fujita-ha, Ichijo-ha, Kobata-ha and Sanjo-ha after Yoshitada died.
From the Nanbokucho period to the Muromachi period Shokan and Ryoei of Fujita-ha and Shogei and Shoso of Shirohata-ha appeared within Chinzei-ha and founded new sects, overcoming Seizan-ha and other sects of Chinzei-ha.
Especially, Seido insisted on the rule of Goju-soden (Fivefold Transmission) because Jodo Shu has a succession of dogma and genealogy, and tried to integrate various sects by organization of genealogy and dogma.
Shoso built Zojo-ji Temple and his disciple, Gutei, built Daiju-ji Temple at the request of Chikatada MATSUDAIRA.
Chion-in, which was revived by Shirohata-ha after the Onin War, was admitted as the head temple of Jodo Shu by Emperor Ogimachi in 1575 and given authority to grant or deny vestments to Jodo Shu monks in Japan ('Kiharinji').
In addition, after the foundation of the Edo Shogunate by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, who was a descendant of Chikatada MATSUDAIRA, Jodo Shu was protected heavily.
Sonsho in Chion-in and Son'o in Zojo-ji Temple were especially respected by Ieyasu.
In 1615 Jodoshu hatto was established as one of the rules of Jiin shohatto, in which Chion-in was recognized as the head temple, and Zojo-ji Temple was given the name of Daihonzan and Sorokusho (a government office of religion) was founded there although it had a lower position than Chion-in.
At this time the Edo government established Jodo Seizan-ha hatto for Seizan-ha independently.
By these rules Jodo Shu was protected by Tokugawa Shogunate, in other words, Shogunate and domain system.
After the chaos of Haibutsu kishaku, Tetsujo UGAI and Gyokai FUKUDA tackled modernization of Jodo Shu. Integration of Chinzei-ha by the Shirohata-ha that unified Nagoshi-ha and others led to the prototype of present Jodo Shu.
After World War, Kurodani Jodoshu, based in Konkaikonmyo-ji Temple, and Honpa Jodoshu (Jodoshu Honpa), based in Chion-in, became independent, but in 1961, when a memorial ceremony for the 750th anniversary of Honen's death was held, Jodoshu Honpa returned and Kurodani Jodoshu also returned 16 years later.
The representative director of Jodo Shu as a present religious corporation is called 'Shumu Socho' and responsible director is called 'Naikyoku'.
On the other hand, Seizan-ha has been separated into Seizan Jodoshu, Seizan Zenrinji-ha and Seizan Fukakusa-ha.
Jodoshu Shasei-ha, which was separated in the reform movement in Edo period, also has remained.

The Shingon sect is a Buddhist sect of Japan that was founded by Kukai (Kobo Daishi) in the early ninth century.
It is also called the Shingon Darani sect, Mandala sect or Himitsu sect.
It is based on Mikkyo, or esoteric Buddhism, which Kukai learned from Eka (Keika), at Shoryu-ji Temple (Qinglongsi Temple) in Choan, (Changan) (Xian City) during the Tang dynasty.
Meanwhile, the Tendai sect in Japan, which was founded by Saicho at about the same time, learned the Hoke-kyo Sutra, Mikkyo, commandment and Zen simultaneously.
In his works 'Himitsu Mandala Jujushinron' and 'Hizohoyaku,' Kukai expressed appreciation for another Buddhist sect, Dharma, which was at that time established to some extent, and built that thinking into a rating system of 1 to 10 by placing the Shingon sect above the Dharma.
Finally, he preached that Mikkyo (Shingon Mikkyo) was superior to esoteric Buddhism and that the thinking and sutras of esoteric Buddhism were included to Shingon Mikkyo.
While Tendai Mikkyo is called 'Daimitsu,' Shingon Mikkyo is called 'Tomitsu.'
Mikkyo, of the Shingon sect, was called 'Tomitsu' because it was centered on the To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple).
The founding of the sect
Kukai founded Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple in 816 as a dojo for Zen training, and established a sect having the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple (To-ji Temple), which was given by the Imperial Court in 823, as a fundamental dojo of the Shingon sect.
Before Kukai fell into deep meditation, he asked his disciples to take charge of the temples in which he had worked as a chief priest.
To-ji Temple was put in charge by Jitsue, Kongobu-ji Temple by Shinzen, Jingo-ji Temple by Shinzei, Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) by Eun, Ninna-ji Temple was founded by Kanpyo Hoo (an abdicated emperor who had joined a Buddhist order); (寛平法皇) (Emperor Uda) by Shobo, Enjo-ji Temple by Yakushin and so on.
These temples were permitted to be state-sanctioned schools of monks (Nenbundosha) (年分度者), and therefore tended to be independent.
Kangen became Toji-Choja (the chief abbot of To-ji Temple) and at the same time Kongobu-ji Temple's head priest, and established the Honmatsu system in which To-ji Temple was the head temple and Kongobu-ji Temple was the sub-temple.
Toji-Choja came to control the Shingon sect.
After a defeat in the conflict of Honmatsu, Kongobu-ji Temple was damaged in a fire due to lightning and lost its halls.
Koyasan fell into decline and abandonment due to the tyranny of provincial officers and other reasons.
This situation continued until the mid-Heian period, but Koyasan began to make a recovery after FUJIWARA no Michinaga climbed it (making a pilgrimage to a shrine on the mountain), and he was later followed by the Imperial Family, the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), and court nobles.
Subsequently, it gained financial stability partly due to economic assistance by the Imperial Family, Sekkann-ke regent family, court nobles and so on.
Kakuban and Koyasan
It split into sects because it valued shishisosho, a succession from a teacher to a disciple.
This split was caused by the difference of Jiso (事相), a way to implement Shingon Mikkyo (e.g., a manner of ascetic training).
Dharma itself had been completed by Kukai so that there was no dispute within the sect until the mid-Heian period.
However, at the end of the eleventh century Kakuban (Kogyo Daishi) began to preach the thought of Himitsu Nenbutsu at Koyasan.
Additionally, Kakuban built Daidenpo-in and revitalized Daidenpo-e in order to promote Shingon Dharma.
He tried to achieve the independence of Koyasan from To-ji Temple's control, whereby he abolished the custom whereby Toji-Choja became the head priest of Kongobu-ji Temple at the same time and was ordained to be Kongobu-ji Temple's head priest; however, his effort failed due to the objection of the Kongobu-ji side (Hon-ji side).
Subsequently, he resigned as head priest and retired at Mt. Negoro (Wakayama Prefecture).
After this incident, the Kongobu-ji side (Hon-ji side, 本寺方) continued to fight against Daidenpo-in (inside, 院方), and this continued for a long time.
The two sides split into the Kogi (Kogi Shingon sect) and Shingi (Shingi Shingon sect).
In 1290 Raiyu relocated Daidenpo-in to Mt. Negoro and established the base of the Shingi Shingon sect's Dharma by Kajihosshinsetsu (加持法身説) (Shingi) of Dainichinyorai.
Negoro-ji Temple, founded at Mt. Negoro (including Daidenpo-in) was in its ascendancy but was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1585.
Consequently, Senyo went into Hase-dera Temple in 1588, which came to be the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Buzan-ha.
In 1601 Genyu rebuilt Chishakuin Temple (which had relocated to the precincts of Neogro-ji Temple) at Shichijo, in Kyoto, doing so with Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's support, and later it became the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Chisan-ha.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) To-ji Temple's priests such as Goho and Kenpo completed Tojifujimonkyogaku (東寺不二門教学) and taught Honchikajisetsu (本地加持説) (Kogi) of Dainichinyorai.
During the Edo period, the Edo bakufu carried out a new control measure over religions, against Buddhist sects.
Counter to the Shingon sect, Hatto acts against To-ji Temple, Daigo-ji Temple and Koyasan Gakuryogata, as well as Hatto act against Kanto Shingon sect Kogi (関東真言宗古義法度) were put into effect in 1604.
As a result of these acts, the Shingon sect was placed under bakufu's (government) observation.
After the Meiji Restoration, the Meiji government promoted the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism.
This resulted in the exclusion of Buddhism.
The temples of the Shingon sect suffered great damage without regard to their status as head temples or sub-temples.
Regarding financial matters, the Meiji government forced them to return their wealth.
There was a case of confiscation involved.
Privileges were abolished, and the title of Chokugansho, the temple in which emperors prayed, and Monzeki--the temple where the Imperial Prince lived--were prohibited.
Consequently, many temples began to experience difficulties in their management, so that they were forced to become defunct.
Some monks left the priesthood and returned to secular life.
There is a strong admiration for Kukai, the founder of the sect (Kobo Daishi).
In the tenth century Nyujoshinko, the faith in which Kukai had fallen into deep meditation, was created at Koyasan.
One of the characteristics of the Shingon sects is the preaching of faith in Kobo-daishi (faith in Daishi).
The founder of the sect, Kukai (774-835) was born at Byobu-ga-ura Sanuki-no-kuni (讃岐国屏風浦) (current Zentsu-ji City, Kagawa Prefecture); and as a thinker, writer and talented calligrapher from among the Sanpitsu (the three great calligraphers of history), as well as a Buddhist, he had a strong influence on Japanese culture in later years.
He went to Tang on the ship "Kentoshi" in 804, and was given an essential Dharma of Mikkyo from Eka, of Shoryu-ji Temple, in Choan.
He obtained many Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist altar pieces and a Buddhist picture in Tang, and brought them to Japan.
In 816 Kukai obtained the land of Koyasan (Koya-cho, Itogun, Wakayama Prefecture) and founded Kongobu-ji Temple there; later (in 823), the Emperor Saga gave him To-ji Temple, which was a national temple of Heian-kyo, and he made these temples the fundamental dojo of Shingon Mikkyo.
On March 21, 835, he fell into deep meditation at the age of 62 at Koyasan.
In 921, 86 years after Kukai's demise, the Emperor Daigo awarded him the posthumous title of Kobo Daishi.
A legend holds that there were eight forefathers during the time in which Mikkyo occurred in India; this was conveyed to Kukai (Kobo Daishi) through China, and subsequently Kukai established the Shingon sect.
This is called Shingon Hasso.
There are two kinds of Hasso--Fuho Hasso (eight forefathers from Dainichinyorai to Kukai) and Denji Hasso (eight forefathers who appeared during the period of history in which the teachings of the Shingon sect had been introduced to Japan)--and Kukai described the origin of Shingon Mikkyo, the biographies of the seven forefathers of Fuho and seven forefathers of Denji (seven forefathers of Fuso and Denji Hasso except Kobo-daishi) and lineage of Fuho in his works 'Himitsu Mandala Kyo Fuho Den (秘密曼荼羅教付法伝)' and 'Shingon Fuho Den (真言付法伝).'
One of the characteristics of temples of the Shingon sect is that Shingon Hasso (Denji Hasso) are enshrined in the main hall or other places (they are often drawn as pictures).
(Some temples do not enshrine them.)
This shows the orthodox lineage of the Shingon sect Dharma.
It was when Kongosatta heard Dainichinyorai's sermon that the Shingon Dharma's lineage began.
Dainichinyorai
Kongosatta
Ryumyo Bosatsu
Ryuchi Bosatu
Kongochisanzo
Fukusanzo
Keika Ajari
Kobo-daishi
It means that eight forefathers who appeared during the period of history in which the teachings of the Shingon sect had been introduced to Japan.
Dainichinyorai and Kongosatta were removed from Fuho Hasso because they were not historical figures, and consequently the other two forefathers were added.
They are also called Hasso Daishi.
Each forefather has a belonging that illustrates the essence of enlightenment.
It was said that Ryuju Bosatsu had been given Mikkyo sutras from Kongosatta, an immediate pupil of Dainichinyorai, and thus conveyed them in this world.
(He holds Sankosho in the right hand.)
Ryuchi Bosatsu: he was initiated into Mikkyo from Ryumyo.
(He has sutras in the right hand.)
Kongochisanzo went to Tang and conveyed "Kongocho-kyo" after he learned Mikkyo from Ryuchi in India.
(He has a beadroll in his right hand.)
Fukusanzo was born in western China.
He went to Tang with his uncle, a merchant, and became a disciple of Kongochi at Choan.
He translated 'Kongocho-kyo' into Chinese, and opened Kanjo Dojo.
(He makes Gebaku-in, a symbolic Buddhist gesture, with his fingers.)
Zenmuisanzo was born in India.
He learned Mahayana Buddhism and took over Mikkyo.
He went to Tang at the age of 80, and conveyed the Dainichi-kyo sutra.
(He holds up the index finger of his right hand.)
Zen master Ichigyo was born in China.
He studied Zen, Tendai Dharma, astronomy and mathematics.
He learned from Zenmui at Choan, and completed 'Dainichikyo-sho' based on the dictations of Zenmui.
(Clothed in his clerical garb, he makes a symbolic gesture with his fingers.)
Keika Ajari was born in China.
He took over the Mikkyo of Vajradhatu and Garbhadhatu.
(He is seated on a chair and has a child serve beside him.)
Kobo-daishi was given both Vajradhatu and Garbhadhatu from Keika Ajari, and he founded Shingon Mikkyo by conveying them.
Kukai
(He has five-prong pestles on his right hand and a rosary in his left hand.)
The dharmas of the Shingon sect are Sokushin Jobutsu (becoming Buddha in this life) and Mitsugonkokudo (esoterically adorned Buddha's Land).
The main image is Dainichinyorai, which is an entity of the universe and the absolute truth.
The fundamental sutra is Dainichi-kyo Sutra (formally, 'Daibirushanajobutsu-Jinpenkaji-kyo Sutra') and Kongocho-kyo (formally, 'Kongocho Issainyorai Shinjitsusetsudaijogensho Daikyoo-kyo' or 'Kongocho-Yuga-Shinjitsu-Daio-kyo Sutra,' 'Soshitsuji-kyo Sutra,' 'Yugi-kyo Sutra,' 'Yoryakunenju-kyo Sutra,' 'Rishu-kyo Sutra,') and so on.
The ronso (academic papers) are 'Bodaishinron,' 'Shakumakaenron,' 'Dainichi-kyoso' and so on.
The following works of Kukai are considered to be ronso: 'Himitsu-Mandala-Jujushinron (Jujushinron),' 'Hizo-Hoyaku,' 'Benkenmitsu-Nikyoron,' 'Sokushinjobutsu-gi,' 'Shojijisso-gi,' 'Un-jigi' and so on.
According to the Dharma, ascetic training of the Three Mysteries (the Secret of the Body, i.e., making symbolic gestures with the fingers; the Secret of Speech, i.e., reciting Shingon; and the Secret of Mind, i.e., visualization of the Buddha in the Mandala picture) leads to integration with the main image and Sokushin Jobutsu, which means that one becomes Buddha with one's present physical body.
Jiso' and 'Kyoso' are considered important in the learning of Shingon Mikkyo.
Jiso is a word (as opposed to Kyoso) and a way to implement Shingon Mikkyo.
It means a manner of ascetic training (修法) (training manners (行法) such as Kanjo, rite, Kanpo (meditation, 観法) and Ingei (sign made with the fingers, 印契), Shingon), while Kyoso is a theory of Shingon Mikkyo.
Dainichi-kyo Sutra, the main sutra of the Shingon sect, is a sutra of Kyoso, and Kongocho-kyo is a sutra of Jiso.
Learning Kyoso leads to an understanding of Shingon Mikkyo theory, and learning Jiso leads to the implementation of a theory.
Jiso, without any support of Kyoso, simply becomes a meaningless activity.
Without learning both Jiso and Kyoso, one cannot reach the ideal of Shingon Mikkyo.
To explain the importance of learning both Jiso and Kyoso, some have compared Jiso and Kyoso to two wheels on a single cart.
Additionally, Jiun said, 'Kyoso does not exist without Jiso and Jiso does not exist without Kyoso, so that we should learn them together and try to attain Mitsugi (the Dharma of Mikkyo)(密義).'
The research of Jiso has been popular since the mid-ninth century (during the mid-Heian period).
Yakushin began Hirosawa-ryu school, and Shoho began Ono-ryu school.
Both schools separated into six schools each, e.g. Yataku Juni-ryu (12 schools of Yataku, also called Konpon Juni-ryu (12 schools of basics)), and ultimately they became 36 schools.
Later, the number of schools exceeded 100.
The schools of Shingon Mikkyo's Jiso were all derived from two schools: Hirosawa-ryu and Ono-ryu.
Hirosawa-ryu and Ono-ryu (Yataku Juni-ryu)
During the mid-Heian period, Yakushin began Hirosawa-ryu school and Shoho began Ono-ryu school.
Both schools split into six schools and called themselves Yataku Juni-ryu or Konpon Juni-ryu.
In the definition of Yataku Juni-ryu, Jimyoiin-ryu is not included in Hirosawa-ryu.
Moreover, Nakanoin-ryu is not included in Ono-ryu.
This is because both schools had moved to Koyasan.
These are distinguished simply because they play no role in Kujo no Shuho (official Mikkyo rites, 公請の修法) such as Goshichinichimishiho (annual Shingon prayer ritual), so that Yataku Juni-ryu does not include all the schools of Tomitsu Jiso (東密事相).
It is characterized by the high value that is placed on Giki (rules of rites,儀軌).
It was named after the place name of Hensho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) built by Kancho, which lies in the south of Hirosawa-no-ike Pond (in the Saga Hirosawa, Ukyo ward of Kyoto City).
In a broad sense, when Tomitsujiso is divided in two, it is the school as opposed to Ono-ryu.
In a narrow sense, Ninna-san-ryu (within the school of Hirosawa-ryu) and Hirosawa-san-ryu are together called Hirosawa-roku-ryu.
However, which of the schools should be included in Roku-ryu is not established, and there is a theory that includes Hokuin-ryu and Jisonin-ryu in the lineage of Kannonin-ryu and Ninna-goryu.
Hojuin-ryu, Ninna-goryu and Nishinoin-ryu are called Ninna-san-ryu, and Kezoin-ryu, Ninnikusen-ryu and Denpoin-ryu are called Hirosawa-san-ryu.
The simplified lineage of Hirosawa-ryu schools
Ninna-goryu simplified lineage (founder, Kakuho): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Kakuho
Nishinoin-ryu simplified lineage (founder, Shinsho (信証)): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Shinsho
Hojuiin-ryu simplified lineage (founder, Eigen): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Eigon

Denpoin-ryu simplified lineage (founder, Kakuban): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Kakuban
It is characterized by the high value that is placed on the instruction of the secrets.
It was named after the place name of the Yamashina Ono, Higashiyama ward of Kyoto City, the site of Zuishinin grand head temple of the Shingon sect Zentsuji-ha (真言宗善通寺派大本山随心院) (formerly called Mandala Temple).
In some cases Shobo is regarded as an originator (元祖) of Ono-ryu while Ningai, who founded Zuishinin, is regarded as a founder (流祖) of Ono-ryu.
In a broad sense, it was the school that was opposed to Hirosawa-ryu when Tomitsujiso was divided in two.
In a narrow sense it indicates Daigo-san-ryu (Rishoin-ryu, Sanpoin-ryu and Kongooin-ryu) and Kajuji-san-ryu (Zuishinin-ryu, Anshoji-ryu, Kajuji-ryu).
In other cases it indicates only Zuishinin-ryu.
The simplified lineage of Ono-ryu schools

The Shingon sect is one of the sects that have many schools among Buddhist sects in Japan.
Generally, it has developed a wide variety of dharma since it split into the Kogi Shingon sect and Shingi Shingon sect at the end of the thirteenth century.
It relies on Dharma-Kaya of Hon-ji, of Dainichinyorai (Kogi).
It preaches that each event and each thing in this world is a sermon of Dainichinyorai, Buddhism's highest form of existence (the truth itself is regarded as Buddha's body).
It was begun by Kakuban (Kogyo Daishi) and relies on the Dharma of Adhisthana-kaya of Dainichinyorai (Shingi).
It preaches that each event and each thing in this world is a sermon of Dainichinyorai, Adhisthana-kaya.
Consequent upon the enactment of Religious Organizations Act in 1939, Shingon sects (except for the Shingon Risshu) were integrated as the Shingon sect.
However, after World WarⅡmany sects split and became independent one after another, so that today there are more than 50 schools.
The 18 grand head temples of the main 16 schools were set up as the Grand Head Temple's association of Shingon sect schools (Kakuzankai) on June 15, 1958, in order to communicate with each other, cultivate mutual friendships and hold events in cooperation with one another.
These temples are called the 18 head temples of the Shingon sect (真言宗十八本山).

Goshichinichinomishiho is also called Shingoninmishiho and others, and is commonly known as Mishiho.
Because Kukai (Kobo-daishi) had prayed for the peace of Japan, the safety of the Emperor and the prosperity of the people at the Imperial Palace in 834, it was held annually as a New Year event of the Imperial Palace.
Although there were several interruptions, including civil war during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), it was revived through the efforts of the Emperor Go-Mizuono and Gien, Daigo-ji Temple's head priest in 1623, after an absence of 170 years.
It was held until 1871, when it was abolished under the influence of the official decree on the exclusion of Buddhism.
It was revived through a petition by Unsho SHAKU and others in 1883.
Subsequently, the place of ascetic training was moved from the Palace to Kanjo-in of To-ji Temple.
The ascetic training is held 21times.
Participants use Kongokai-ho and Taizokai-ho alternately, one year each, and implement the rites of peace and increase of benefit, and Godai-myoo (五大明王), Juni-ten (十二天), Shoten-ho (聖天法) and so on.
On the first day (開白) of January 8, the imperial messenger, who has the Karabitsu (Chinese-style chest) in which the Emperor's cloth is placed, is sent from the Imperial Household Agency to Kanjo-in of To-ji Temple, and he places it within the inner hall of To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo.
On the 11th (the middle day, 中日) and the 14th (expiration of term of a vow), the imperial messenger burns incense and worships at To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo.
On the 14th, a ceremony to return the Emperor's cloth to the imperial messenger is held at the front hall of To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo, and Goshichinichinomishiho ends successfully (成満).
This is regarded as the supreme secret ceremony of the Shingon sect, and religious articles (法具) such as a rosary, five-pronged pestles, a stole and others, which are used in ascetic training, were brought by Kukai (Kobo-daishi) from Tang (China).
Previously, Toji-Choja played a role of Dai Ajari.
Currently, the role of Dai Ajari, who holds ascetic training (the more specific name is Homuhoin Dai Ajari (法務法印大阿闍梨), commonly known as Daia (大阿)) is alternated by the chief abbots of each sect belonging to the grand head temple's association of Shingon sect schools every year, and after serving as Dai Ajari he is installed as the chief abbot of the Shingon sect.
The term of service is one year.
Customarily, he is given the staff of the chief abbot at the time of inauguration.
For the time after the expiration of the term of a vow, To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo is open to the public and anyone can worship there.
The Soto sect is one of the five Zen sects of China (Rinzai, Igyo, Soto, Unmon and Hogen) and one of the five Zen sects (Nihon Daruma, Rinzai, Soto, Obaku and Fuke) in Japan.
Its head temples are Eihei-ji Temple (Fukui Prefecture) and Soji-ji Temple (Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama City).
Unlike the Rinzai sect, it does not make use of koans (paradoxical anecdotes or riddles used in Zen Buddhism to achieve enlightenment through meditation), practising instead Mokusho Zen (literally, "the zen of silent enlightenment"), which focuses exclusively on mediation.
The Soto sect in Japan was introduced by Dogen.
Dogen went to the Southern Sungs during the Kamakura period, studied under Nyojo TENDO of the Soto sect at Mt. Tendo, and came back to Japan in 1226.
Dogen himself considered his teaching as the 'True Dharma' and denied sectionalism.
For this reason he prohibited his disciples from using a particular sect's name by themselves and conveyed a feeling of rejection when viewed as one of the Zen sects.
It is said that he told them to use the name 'Busshin sect' if they were compelled to identify themselves.
Triggered by joining one of the Nihon Daruma sect groups that were persecuted by Kofuku-ji Temple, after Dogen's nirvana they gradually began to proclaim themselves as one of the Zen sects.
'Soto,' as the name of the sect, came into use during the age of the fourth Jokin KEIZAN and the subsequent Shoseki GAZAN,
While the Rinzai sect was supported by the military government at the time and had political and cultural influence, the Soto sect spread among local lords, local ruling families, low warriors and common people.
The 'True Dharma of Buddhism' traditionally respects Shaka as a main image--'Namu Shakamuni-butsu'--and focuses on meditation, mainly with 'the mind itself is Buddha' as its center.
As opposed to the Chinese Zen tradition, the seated meditation of the Soto sect usually focuses on 'shikan-taza' (single-mindedly sitting in meditation) based on Dogen's teaching of 'Shushoichinyo' (immeasurable ascetic training as a way toward becoming Buddha), while a few styles use Zen questions for meditation (meditation for enlightenment), as does the Rinzai sect.
Moreover, "Shobogenzo," which was written by Dogen, fully describes Buddhism and is different from the view of Chinese Zen, which proclaims Furyumonji (不立文字).
As of 2005, it chants the three slogans of 'human rights,' 'peace' and 'environment.'
The sutras mainly recited
"Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo)"
"Myohorengekyo Kanzeonbosatsu fumonhon"
"Myohorengekyo Nyoraijuryohon"
"Daihishindarani"
"Kanromon Sutra"
"Sandokai Sutra"
"Hokyozanmai Sutra"
"Shariraimon Sutra"
The basic soroku (sutras described by masters)
"Shobogenzo": Dogen's description (incomplete;
edited later by disciples)
"Denkoroku": Keizan's sermon, put together by his disciples
"Shushogi Sutra" was edited from "Shobogenzo" for the benefit of believers during the Meiji period.

The chief priest of each head temple is called the chief abbot, and every two years one of the two chief abbots takes a turn as the superintendent priest.
Approximately 15,000 temples of this sect are separated into Yudo-kai of Eihei-ji ha and Sowa-kai of Soji-ji ha, and every four years the Shumusocho（宗務総長) is selected from both groups.
For seven division managers (部長) of the office (内局), as cabinet members half are elected from both groups, and for the members of an assembly （宗議会議員）(72 seats) each member is elected from both groups in 36 areas.
The related school juridical persons are split into Komazawa University, Tohoku Fukushi University of Eiheiji-ha, Aichi Gakuin University and Tsurumi University of Sojiji-ha, and each group has a right to appoint those presidents in practice.
Eihei-ji Temple - Eiheiji-cho, Fukui Prefecture (the chief abbot Zen master Taiho FUKUYAMA)
It was founded by Dogen in 1244, as requested by Yoshishige HATANO of Echizen Province.
Eihei-ji Temple's branch temple, Chokoku-ji Temple - Minato Ward, Tokyo
Eihei-ji Temple's Nagoya branch temple - Daikan-cho, Higashi Ward, Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture
Eihei-ji Temple's Kagoshima branch temple, Shoryu-ji Temple - Matsubara, Aira-gun, Kagoshima Prefecture
Soji-ji Temple -Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama City (chief abbot, Zen master Kosen Omichi)
It was founded by Jokin KEIZAN in 1321 at Monzen-machi, Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, as requested by JOKEN Risshi of the Noto-no-kuni, in Noto Province.
It was destroyed by fire in 1898 and was moved to the present location in 1911.
Sojiji-soin (總持寺祖院) was reconstructed at the original site (Monzen-machi, Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture) in 1905.
Hogen-ji Temple - Matsushiro, Matsumae-cho, Matsumae-gun, Hokkaido
Historically, Shobo-ji Temple (Oshu City, Iwate Prefecture) was the head temple for the two Ou provinces, and Daiji-ji Temple (Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture) was for a while the head temple of Kyushu; however, Eihei-ji Temple and Soji-ji Temple became head temples based on the Act for Temples in 1615.
The Nyorai sect (Nyorai-kyo) was founded in Nagoya in 1802 by Kino ISSONNYORAI.
It had been a temple of the Soto sect since 1884, but ultimately it gained independence through the implementation of the Religious Corporation Act in 1951.
Its dharma is a mixture of a faith for the guardian deity of seafaring, a faith for the purity of the land and others, so that it does not have a strong relationship with the dharma of the Soto sect.
Issonkyodan, the derivative sect mentioned above
Active mainly in Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture
Guze-kyo was established in Niigata by Choan DAIDO in 1886 as a derivation from the Soto sect.
It saw as the main image Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu, who is the Nyorai with great compassion and mercy, and insisted upon relief in the present world by the extreme power of Kannon Bosatsu, which does not consider its own power or that of others (自力他力).
Its dedicated efforts on behalf of social welfare became widespread throughout Japan, but it declined rapidly after Choan DAIDO's nirvana in 1908, partly due to the lack of a successor.
Hoo-kyo was a "popular" religious movement that Doken TAKADA promoted in the latter part of the Meiji period and the Taisho period.
Doken had continued activities such as meditation meetings and sermon visits based at the Seisho-ji Temple, but from the beginning of the Taisho period, he put an emphasis on the promotion of lay Buddhism by publishing monthly magazines or holding lecture meetings without regard to the Soto sect's dharma.
He called his activities 'Hoo-kyo,' meaning 'Buddhism based on Hoo Daisho Shakamunibutsu's true heart.'
After Doken's nirvana in 1923, the movement, which had its own sect name, finished.
Additionally, because Doken retained his title as a monk of the Soto sect until he died, 'Hoo-kyo' is generally considered to be a movement within the Soto sect as opposed to an independent sect.
Sanpo-kyodan was founded by Hakuun YASUTANI in 1954 in Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture, after his withdrawal from the Soto sect.
It built such an original way of training as to place Doken's teaching at the center and use Zen koans for meditation.
Today it focuses on the teaching of meditation for lay people and has bases for Zen meditation abroad.
Other than the foregoing, there are a few independent temples of the Soto sect:
Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu,（अवलोकितेश्वर Avalokiteśvara in Sanskrit) is a sacred image (一尊) of Bosatsu in Buddhism and a kind of Buddha (尊格) that has attained widespread faithful since ancient times, particularly in Japan.
It is also called 'Kanzeon Bosatsu' or 'Kanjizai Bosatsu.'
It has many other names such as 'Kuse Bosatsu' or 'Guse Bosatsu.'
Origin of name
A superior thesis at present regarding the Sanskrit Avalokiteśvara is that it was mixture of words, ava (universally) +lokita (see, saw) + īśvara (universalist).
A translation by Genjosanzo, 'Kanjizai Bosatsu' can be seen as having adopted that thesis.
It is pointed out that the origin relates to the goddess Anahita, a daughter of Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism and Laksmi in the Indian mythology.
In an old translation by Kumaraju, it was called Kanzeon Bosatsu, while at that time the name in China was also Kanzeon Bosatsu.
Accordingly, there is a thesis that it was translated freely, complying with the point of Kannon-gyo Sutra (Myoho Renge-kyo Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumon Hon No. 25, 妙法蓮華経観世音菩薩普門品第二十五).
Additionally, in the old Sanskrit "Hoke-kyo Sutra," which was discovered in Central Asia, it was written as 'avalokitasvara,' so that it can be interpreted as avalokita (see) + svara (sound); there is another old translation as "Koseon Bosatsu," so that it is possible to assume these were different texts.
Because the character "世" could not be used due to the taboo against using the name of the second Tang Emperor Shi Min LI, it became established as Kannon Bosatsu after the Tang period in China.
It was translated as Kanjizai Bosatsu in the new version after Genjosanzo.
Kanjizai means that contemplation with prajna leads to the religious fruit (妙果) of the universalist.
Moreover, it is also called semuisha (施無畏者), the person who gives one a fearless mind, or guse daishi (救世大士), who can relieve this world.
Faith
Based on Kannon-gyo Sutra and others, it is widely believed and worshiped.
In addition, it is the Bosatsu who appears in the beginning of Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo) and is a symbol of Hannya's prajna as well.
In Jodo-kyo, it is often placed as an attendant of Amidanyorai with Seishi Bosatsu by the preaching of Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra.
The fundamental sword (本誓） of Kannon Bosatsu is great compassion and mercy.
In Japan it had been shaped into a statue from the Asuka period and, linked with practical benefits in this world, it is widely believed without regard to time and place.
It has a suibyo (a small water bottle).
It is said that in the suibyo there is kudokusui (功徳水), meaning water that never dries up.
The pure land where Kannon lives is called Potaraka (Fudaraku) and is preached in 'Kegon-kyo Sutra' as 補怛落迦 of 摩頼矩咤国 in southern India.
Kanzeon Bosatsu is often assumed to be a female, as in the term 'Jibo (affectionate mother) Kannon.'
This is because Jizo Bosatsu is seen as a pair of Ichi-Sendai-Daihi-Sendai(一闡提大悲闡提) like Kannon, and many Kannon statues have feminine faces while Jizo is a male monk.
Because Shaka calls Kannon 'zennanshi, a man who believes Buddhism' in Sutras and there is a word 'Kannon Daishi,' it was originally regarded as a male; however, in Kannon-gyo Sutra it gives a sermon with a feminine appearance to women (婦女身得度者、即現婦女身而為説法) so that gradually it has been assumed to have no sexuality.
In later ages it tends to be seen as female.
This is because the faith for Kannon spread widely from Fudaraku (Zhoushan islands and the east-central Chinese province of Zhejiang), a great holy place, to the East China Sea and Huang Hai, so that it came to be related to the folk faith of praying for a safe voyage and the faith in goddesses such as Matsu (of Taoism).
Therefore, some people discuss the sexuality of Kannon, associating it with 'Henjo Nanshi (変成男子)' in Hoke-kyo sutra, but apparently there is no relationship between them.
When Kannon relieves people in this world, it changes its appearance in various ways according to the person's mind (character or ability to understand the teachings of Buddhism).
This is called Fumonjigen (普門示現) by Kannon.
According to 'Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumon Hon No. 25' of the Hoke-kyo (Kannon-gyo) sutra, in order to provide relief to all people, Kanzeon Bosatsu adopts one of 33 different appearances to meet the needs of the particular person; these appearances include 'Busshin,' 'Shomonshin,' and 'Bonnoshin' (as below).
The number '33,' which is seen in the names such as the 33 Temples of Saigoku (西国三十三箇所) or Sanjusangendo (33-gendo) Temple, stems from this.
Additionally, '33 Kannon' (see below) came to be believed based on the concept of Hoke-kyo Sutra in China and modern Japan, but there is no description of the 33 Kannon's names in Hoke-kyo sutra.
This idea of Fumonjigen led to the creation of various appearances of Kannon, such as Roku Kannon, Shichi Kannon, Jugoson Kannon and Sanjyu-san Kannon.
For this reason there are various shapes of statues of the Kannon, called Henge (Changed) Kannon (other than the basic Sho Kannon).
Unlike the perception of Kannon as an attendant of Amidanyorai, Kannon Bosatsu, which was worshiped as an independent Buddha, tends to be prayed to for practical benefits in this world.
Therefore, it is often portrayed as having a superhuman appearance with many faces and many hands, this being from the viewpoint of relieving all people and achieving all people's wishes.

In the Shingon sects Sho Kannon, Juichimen Kannon (i.e. Kannon with 11 faces (十一面観音), Senju Kannon, Bato Kannon, Nyoirin Kannon and Jundei Kannon are called Roku Kannon (six Kannon), and in the Tendai sects Fukukensaku Kannon is added to Roku Kannon instead of Jundei Kannon.
The image of Roku Kannon was created from the idea that six kinds of Kannon relieve people who have lost their way in six worlds, based on Rokudo (Rokudo Rinne, a belief that every life repeats reincarnation into six types of worlds) as the following combinations show: Jigoku-do (地獄道) - Sho Kannon, Gaki-do (餓鬼道) - Senju Kannon, Chikusho-do (畜生道) - Bato Kannon, Shura-do (修羅道) - Juichimen Kannon, Jin-do (人道) - Jundei Kannon, Ten-do (天道) - Nyoirin Kannon.
Additionally, although Senju Kannon is thought to have 1,000 hands and one eye in each of those hands, many statues show '1,000 hands' using 42 hands because it is difficult to in fact shape 1,000 hands (with minor exceptions such as Toshodai-ji Temple Kondo).
The origin from which Kanzeon Bosatsu got 1,000 hands is "Senjusengen Kanzeon Bosatsu Kodaienmanmugedaihishin Darani-kyo," as translated by Gabon-Datsuma.
Daihishindarani, in the last part of this sutra, is still recited at Zen sect temples in China and Japan.
Shichi Kannon is the seven appearances of Kannon in order to civilize people.
It consists of the six Kannon of the Shingon sects and the Fukukensaku Kannon.
Jyugoson Kannon is the fifteen appearances of 33 Kannon (see next section), i.e. Byakue, Yoe, Suigetsu, Yoryu, Amadai, Tara, Shokyo, Ruri, Ryuzu, Jikyo, Enko, Yuge, Renga, Takimi and Seyaku.
The following names of 33 Kannon are described in "Butsuzozui (仏像図彙)," a book published in 1783.
There are various origins of the 33 Kannon; among them, while some kannons (such as Byakue Kannon and Tarason Kannon) originated in India, others developed uniquely in China and Japan.
Some kannons, such as Byakue Kannon and Yoryu Kannon, are often drawn in Buddhist pictures of Zen sects and in ink wash, but most kannons do not have the independent form of a statue.

Works of fiction in which Kannon Bosatsu appears
Journey to the West, "Monkey King"
In every scene Kannon Bosatsu appears several times to protect Sanzohoshi by the order of Shaka Nyorai.
This story took a hint from the legend that Genjosanzo, a model of Sanzohoshi, traveled to the west with the Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo).
"Feng-Shen-Yen-I"
Kannon Bosatsu, in Buddhism, was depicted as Jiko Shinjin, having been changed by Dokyo during the Ming Dynasty; and there is a character, Jiko Dojin, in a novel "Feng-Shen-Yen-I," which was written at nearly the same time period, and later he became Kannon Bosatsu without any activity as Kannon Bosatsu.
Additionally, in this novel Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu appear as sacred images (天尊) and later come to be Bosatsu of Buddhism, thus showing the rich imagination of the Chinese.
The Obaku sect is a sect of Buddhism in Japan and one of the Zen sects, after the Rinzai and Soto sects.
It was named after Kiun OBAKU (a master of Gigen RINZAI), a monk of Tang.
While the Rinzai and Soto sects have evolved in the Japanese style, the Obaku sect has retained the Ming Dynasty's style in modern times.
The head temple is Obakusan Manpuku-ji Temple in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, which was founded by Ingen.
History
In Japan the Obaku sect was started by Ryuki INGEN, a Zen master of the Chinese Rinzai sect, who was invited from China at the period of Ming and Qing dynasties in 1654, during the early Edo period.
Traditionally, it had invited the chief priest of the temple from China, until Zen Master Ryuto, who in 1740 took up a new position as the fourteenth chief priest of a Buddhist temple.
At the early stage it identified itself as the 'Rinzaisei sect' or 'Rinzaizen sect Obaku-ha,' implying that it transmitted Orthodox Rinzai Zen.
Its style has been influenced by a mixture of Zen, so to speak, which reflects the Kegon, Tendai and Jodo sects and is characteristic of Chinese Zen during the Ming Dynasty.
As background for the protection of the government (the shogunate), it was supported by Japanese feudal lords and made efforts to civilize people through social works by monks such as Doko TETSUGEN, so that it gradually extended its influence.
There are 33 Tatchu (subtemples located in the precincts of a larger temple) of Manpuku-ji Temple, and 'Subtemple Notes' of 1745 recorded 1043 subtemples.
Because the Meiji government's Ministry of Religion restricted Zen to the two sects of Rinzai and Soto in 1874, it was forced to change its name to 'Rinzai sect Obaku-ha'; however, in 1876 it formally gained independence as the Obaku sect, one of the Zen sects.
Zen Master Doko TETSUGEN, who was a successor (法孫) of Ingen, carved out a pattern of Daizo-kyo on a woodblock, which is called "Tetsugen-ban Version (Obaku-ban Version) Issai-kyo Sutra," based on the Daizo-kyo introduced by Ingen describing the trials and tribulations, and published it so that not merely the research of Buddhism in Japan would make dramatic process but the technology of publishing did as well.
On the other hand, Zen Master Ryoo Dokaku helped Tetsugen to carve Issaikyo wood blocks with revenue from the sales of the Chinese herb "kintaien," and he built Kangakuin in many places in order that everyone could read it, thus setting a precedent for the library system in Japan.
After that, Tetugen Issai-kyo Sutra was designated as an important cultural property and was printed continuously at the Hozoin Temple of Obakusan Manpuku-ji Temple.
Obaku Toin
The sutras of the Obaku sect have been recited according to ancient Chinese pronunciation, which is called 'Obaku Toin.'
Shakanyorai (Shikyajirai or Shakamuni-butsu) is a title of respect for Shaka (Kudonshittaruta, Gautama Siddhaartha in Sanskrit, Gotama Siddhatthaa in Pali), a founder of Buddhism, as Buddha.
In Theravada Buddhism (so-called Hinayana), Shakamuni-butsu is regarded as the sole Buddha in this world.
The disciple who achieved supreme enlightenment was called Arakan, and he was positioned as a saint who was delivered from earthly bondage by the sermons of Shaka as Buddha.
According to Mahayana Buddhism, Shakamuni-butsu (Shakanyorai) is one of the immeasurable Buddhas at the ten directions (east, south, west and north, each midpoint, up and down) and three worlds (past, future and present) as well as a Buddha in this corrupt world.
Moreover, Trikaya, the three bodies of Buddha, considers Buddha a figure in front of the people of the present world.
Among the Mahayana Buddhism sects, there is a dispute over who is the main image in Nichiren and Hokke sects; additionally, there is a conflict between a thesis that considers Shaka to be the original Buddha and another that considers it to be Nichiren.
Among these, the main image of the former is Shakamuni-butsu as the original Buddha.
This was argued in the Tendai sect before, but today it is often discussed among the Nichiren and Hokke sects.
This means Shakamuni-seson, who has an immeasurably long life (無量長寿) in Nyorai Juryo Hon No. 16 of the Hoke-kyo sutra.
This does not mean the historical Gautama Siddhartha (Shaka), who flourished in ancient India on the Eurasian Continent, but instead it means the religious Shakamuni-seson, who has existed from ancient times before he was born in India and continues to exist in the future after his nirvana.
According to that thesis, other immeasurable Buddhas are the Trace Buddha, who is only a copy of the original Buddha Shakuson, so that if you see him as the moon the other Buddha will be 1,000 moons reflected in a rice terrace.
It is an object of faith for the groups that consider Shaka to be the original Buddha.
It is also called Kuon Honbutsu, which is reflected in the temple's name as the Nichiren Sect of Buddhism grand head temple Minobusan Kuon-ji Temple (Minamikoma-gun, Yamanashi Prefecture).
Moreover, in the Hoke-kyo Sutra it is stated that Shakanyorai did not become Buddha under the line tree for the first time but had already awakened in an immeasurable past time; in Nehan-gyo sutra there are more descriptions about the future, which states that Nyorai exists forever without any change and ultimately denies Mappo (Age of the Final Dharma) as an expediency.
Therefore, it is said that Hoke-kyo Sutra teaches Kuonjitsujo (久遠実成) and Nehan-gyo Sutra teaches Kuonshochu (久遠常住).
Statues of Shakanyorai were shaped over wide-ranging areas, where Buddhism had spread from India.
Most of them were designed to describe the real Shaka's biography as a picture or to shape a particular scene separately.
In Japan, statue of birth, statue of training, statue of struggling against the devil, statue of a sermon being given and statue of nirvana were shaped.
Among them, the "sermon" statue is the most popular; it expresses the figure of Shaka, who preaches Dharma as indicated by seppo-in, his gesture for a sermon.
For example, the bronze statues at Horyu-ji Temple Kondo in Nara and at Kaniman-ji Temple in Kyoto are famous, as are the wooden figures of Muroo-ji Temple Kondo in Nara and Daihoon-ji Temple in Kyoto.
Additionally, the style of the Seiryoji-type Shakanyorai, which was modeled on Zuizo of Seiryo-ji Temple in Kyoto, is also widespread.
It is often placed on the altars of the Shaka triad.
The two attendants are often Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu.
In the Hokke and Nichiren sects, the style of Sanposon (三宝尊) (Ittoryozon, 一塔両尊) is often adopted.
In this style the Taho Pagoda (pagoda), in which the Nichiren chant is written, is placed at the center, with Shakanyorai on the left side and Tahonyorai on the right side as seen by the person who enshrines, and a statue of Nichiren as a monk is placed under them.

"Journey to the West" remonstrates with Goku SON (Sun Wu Kong), and leads Sanzohoshi to Tenjiku, India.
The role of "Oshakasama" in "Journey to the West" (a TV drama from Fuji Television Network, Inc.) was played by Masaaki SAKAI.
Daibutsu is a popular name meaning a large statue of the Buddha as a Buddhist image.
In the Buddhist region of Asia, such as China, statues of Buddha had been carved into rock faces since ancient times.
In Japan it was the first time that Emperor Shomu built a Daibutsu of Todai-ji Temple in order for the power of the Imperial Court in the ritsuryo system to become widely known through Buddhism.
Since then, large statues of Buddha have been built in many places by people who pursue acts of great piety.
In Japan there are statues of Buddha that are called '○○Daibutsu' in many places, but there is no standard as to how large one should be in order to be called 'Daibutsu.'
Until World WarⅡ, 'Nara Great Buddha,' 'Kamakura Great Buddha' and 'Hyogo Great Buddha' were called 'Nihon Sandaibutsu (three large statues of Buddha in Japan),' but since Hyogo Daibutsu was broken during wartime delivery (the present Hyogo Daibutsu was rebuilt) there is now controversy as to which should be the third Daibutsu next to 'Nara Great Buddha' and 'Kamakura Great Buddha.'
Currently, there are some large statues that are identified as Nihon Sandai Daibutsu: 'the Great Image of Buddha at Takaoka,' 'Hyogo Great Buddha (rebuilt),' 'Nihon-ji Great Buddha,' 'Gifu Great Buddha,' 'Great Buddha of Ushiku,' 'Great Buddha of Tokyo,' 'Great Buddha of Akada' and so on.
A TV program titled "Tamori Club," aired by the TV Asahi Corporation on May 4, 2007, had a special feature on Nihon Sandaibutsu and decided on the third Great Buddha.
Mikkyo is an abbreviation for Himitsu Bukkyo, or esoteric Buddhism.
Among Mikkyo believers it is also called Vajrayana, as opposed to Mahayana Buddhism and Hinayana.
It identifies itself as Buddhism, but among scholars there is controversy as to whether Mikkyo is included in Buddhism or not.
While in Mahayana Buddhism (exoteric Buddhism) dharma is preached broadly to people through words and texts, characteristically in Mikkyo a very mystical and symbolic dharma is transmitted by a master to a disciple within the sect.
The reason that Tibetan Buddhism, which took over Indian Mikkyo, was previously called 'Lamaism' is due to the characteristic that a disciple believes his 'lama' absolutely at the time of transmittal.
The ritual by which to prove that a master has completely transmitted dharma to a disciple is called Denpo Kanjo (伝法灌頂), and the complete transmission of dharma is compared to 'pouring water from a bottle to another bottle without spilling a drop.'
In the background of Mikkyo's establishment was such a social situation that Buddhism was oppressed as Hinduism flourished during the latter period of Indian Buddhism.
Mikkyo tried to revive Indian Buddhism by incorporating the elements of Hinduism into Buddhism.
However, the incorporation of Mikkyo with Indian Buddhism could not limit the growth of Hinduism, and as a result Indian Buddhism declined.
Soon, it was attacked politically and diplomatically from two sides: one, by the Islamic government (Delhi sultanate) that had invaded from northern India, which was ruled by Muslims from Western Asia; and secondly, by the Hindu government of southern India.
Attacked by Islam for its worship of an idol and magical elements, Mikkyo in India was forced to disappear into history as the last stage of Indian Buddhism.
The early stage of Mikkyo, Zo-mitsu (the Mixed Esoteric Buddhism), which was established at the stage when magical elements were incorporated into Buddhism, was not particularly systematized but aimed to gain practical benefits in this world by reciting mantra, Shingon and litany, as well as the spell of each Buddha, being affected by the mantra of Brahmanism, in which religious services were performed.
There was no Mikkyo sutra, and a curse on (咒) and litany were seen in the various sutras of Mahayana Buddhism.
In order to protect against the emergent Hinduism, the middle stage of Mikkyo was established more seriously as a systematized form of Buddhism.
The middle stage of Mikkyo, as opposed to the Mahayana Buddhism in which a form of Shakamuni was preached, compiled Mikkyo sutras consisting of the teachings of 大毘盧遮那仏（Mahāvairocana), or Dainichinyorai by another name.
After the accomplishment of "Dainichi-kyo Sutra," "初会金剛頂経"（Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha） and their commentary, Mandala, which showed the world view of Mikkyo incorporating various Buddhas, was produced; thus the Buddhas of Mikkyo were placed into a hierarchyand systematized, as all Buddhas were created from Issainyorai (一切如来), the Five Buddhas of Wisdom around Dainichinyorai: Gochinyorai (五智如来).
While the middle stage of Mikkyo became a complicated system of Buddhism for priests, it couldn't become widespread among Indian people and therefore couldn't change the trend whereby Hinduism, which emphasized daily religious services and folk beliefs, flourished and expanded.
For this reason, in order to hold out against the flourishing of Hinduism in India, there appeared Funnuson (憤怒尊) and Gohoson (護法尊) to pray for the protection of the training of Buddhism and the surrender of the enemy, such as Gozanze Myoo, who defeated Shiva, and Mahakala, who subdued Ganesha and Gundari Myoo.
Because the middle stage of Mikkyo couldn't hold out against the flourishing of Hinduism, the late-stage of Mikkyo, which valued practice instead of theory, was established.
In the late stage of Mikkyo, the principle of Buddha's nature was pursued.
Accompanied by this, Hosshin Fugen (法身普賢), Gonkosatta and Kongo Soji (金剛総持) became to be respected as 最勝本初仏 mostly.
Additionally, being influenced by the tantora of Shakta Hinduism and Shakti belief, Anunttara-yoga was seen characteristically in the late-stage Mikkyo, which was a training of coalescence (sex) between male principles (mind, wisdom, upaya and Vajradhatu) and female principles (body, feeling, Hannya and Garbhadhatu), so that there appeared joyful Buddha (歓喜仏) which showed that the male Buddha (male principle) and female Buddha (female principle) had sexual intercourse.
In the development of research on yoga tantra, bringing Purana to the top of the head from the lower body was regarded as the best way, and having sexual intercourse was considered the most efficient way for that.
However, because of the ruined morals such as with male priests forcing lay female believers to have sexual intercourse as the best means of devoting their bodies, which they practiced despite the broken precepts, some Buddhists left the late-stage Mikkyo and returned to Theravada Buddhism, which valued the religious precepts.
As a response to criticism against priests' having sexual intercourse, the content of Anunttara-yoga was changed from a practice of having sexual intercourse to one in which intercourse was imagined.
Additionally, since Indian Buddhism was expected to collapse under the Muslim invasion in the political and social situation at that time, the Kala cakra tantra (the last Mikkyo sutra) described the following: the flourishing of Islam; the collapse of Indian Buddhism, a concept of Shambhala; a secret Buddhist land and Utopia, which could be reached only through Mikkyo during the period before the revival of Indian Buddhism (the Age of Final Dharma); Raja Cakravarti (ルドラ・チャクリン（転輪聖王）), who became the thirty-second king of Shambhala; a counterattack by Raja Cakravarti against the invaders (Muslims); the prediction that Raja Cakravarti would destroy the king of evil and his supporters in the final war; the revival of Indian Buddhism in the future; the return to order on earth; the coming of the harmonization and peace of the world, and so on.
The Muslim invasion and destruction in northern India interrupted Buddhism (including Mikkyo in India), but a developed system of late-stage Mikkyo can be seen in Tibetan Buddhism.
In Japan, Mikkyo was first introduced by Saicho (Dengyo Daishi), who had returned from Tang.
The Imperial Family and aristocrats at that time were interested in Mikkyo, which valued practical benefits in this world or "pure land" teachings, as well as Jodo-kyo (Buddhist invocation), which promised reincarnation in the Land-of-Bliss/Pure Land of the next world, instead of the Tendai Doctrine, which Saicho had seriously studied.
However, because Saicho mainly studied the Tendai Doctrine but did not do so with Mikkyo, Mikkyo was introduced more properly by Kukai (Kobo-daishi), who studied it at Shoryuji Temple, Qinglongsi Temple (the basis of Chinese Mikkyo), Engyo, Ennin (Jikaku Daishi), Eun, Enchin (Chisho Daishi) and Shuei.
Among the traditional Buddhist sects in Japan, the Shingon sect (whose teachings Kukai learned from Eka) and the Keika of Shoryuji Temple (Xian City) in China (Tang), thus systematized as Shingon Mikkyo (Toumitsu; Shokushin Jobutsu and the guard of the nation being two aspects), and the Nihon Tendai sect (called Daimitsu in some cases), which was begun by Saicho and established by Ennin, Enchin and Annen, are incorporated into Mikkyo.
While members of the Shingon sect learn Mikkyo independently, members of the Tendai sect learn Tendai, Mikkyo, Buddhist precepts and Zen at the same time.
Tomitsu means the Mikkyo of To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple), and Daimitsu means Tendai Mikkyo.
While Tomitsu and Daimitsu, which were transmitted systematically, are called Jun-mitsu (Pure Esoteric Buddhism), Mikkyo, which had been transmitted in fragments and had adherents before Jun-mitsu, is called Zo-mitsu (Mixed Esoteric Buddhism).
In modern China, Chinese Mikkyo, which flourished in the Tang Dynasty (the middle-stage Mikkyo) is called 唐密宗 and Mikkyo in Tibetan Buddhism continues to be called 西蔵密宗.
Mikkyo, which Kukai, Ennin and Enchin of Japan learned in Tang, was 唐密宗.
唐密宗 declined and was interrupted due to the oppression of Zen and Buddhist invocation (pure-land teachings, Jodo-kyo) after the Tang Dynasty.
In modern China, an effort is being made to revive 唐密宗 through an exchange with the Shingon sect of Japan (Tomitsu) such as Seian-ji Temple in Shanghai, but it is a minor activity.
西蔵密宗 has been believed until now around the autonomous region of Tibet and northern China.
It is considered that the reason that 唐密宗, the middle-stage Mikkyo, declined and was interrupted is that Taoism--which was a rival having the same aspects of practical benefits in this world, as well as mojo--was favored.
It is said that Confucianism also had a strong influence in China, so that the late-stage Mikkyo, which flourished in Tibet, Nepal and Mongolia, was not introduced because tantra was in opposition to sexual morality.
Moreover, there is a hypothesis that Indian alchemy became Mikkyo and that Mikkyo was alchemy itself, but it is not widely accepted and remains untried in Buddhist studies.
By extension, the religion and sects that have mystical and symbolic dharma, such as cabala, kabbalah and Booduism, other than Buddhism, are in some cases referred to as Mikkyo.
It is also called Mitsugi Shukyo (密儀宗教).
Amidanyorai, being Amitaabha or Amitaayus in Sanskrit, is one of the Nyorai in Mahayana Buddhism.
It is also called Amitabha Buddha or Midabustu.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a lotus (a lotus in full bloom in Vajradhatumandala and a blooming lotus in Garbha-mandala).
Shuhi, Shuji or Bija (in Mikkyo) is hriiH.
Amitaayus' in Sanskrit means 'a person who has an immeasurable life,' and 'Amitaabha' means 'a person who has immeasurable light'; these show that he is a super-man who has no limit in time and space.
These are freely translated as 無量寿仏 or 無量光仏 and are regarded as the Buddha of light who shines forth in this dark world.
He has the Buddha land, the Land of Bliss in the west.
Generally, he has been depicted as wearing simple clothes with no accessories and shows a symbolic gesture with the fingers of Kubon Raigo-in, i.e., mudra for the nine possible levels of birth into Amida's paradise, Gokuraku (see Mudra for detail), mixed with Jo-in, i.e., samadhi mudra, Seppo-in, i.e., the exposition of the dharma mudra, Semui-in, i.e., mudra for bestowing fearlessness, and Yogan-in, i.e., wish-granting mudra.
When enshrined as the Amida triad Kyoji, it is accompanied by the attendant figures Kannon-Bosatsu (i.e., Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva) and Seishi-Bosatsu (i.e., Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva).
In Mikkyo, it is admired as one of the Nyorai of the five Buddhas (five Buddhas of wisdom).
According to "Muryoju-kyo Bussetu Muryoju-kyo Sutra," he willingly stepped down from the status of Buddha to Bosatsu and practiced ascetic training for the relief of all the living things under Lokeshvararaja Buddha, with the name Dharmakara.
He is the sambhoga-kaya Buddha who had thought about the relief of living things for a very long time (contemplation of five kalpas) and became Buddha by finding a way to achieve birth in the pure land.
He made 48 wishes for the relief of living things; among them the eighteenth wish, called 'Hongwan (本願),' is highly valued, particularly in Jodo-kyo.
Additionally, it is considered that he continues to preach even now.
In "Amida-kyo Sutra" he was praised by as many Buddhas as there were grains of sand in the Ganges River of the universe.
It says 'The power of Amidabutsu was extremely wonderful, and only Amidabutsu wished Hongwan and promised for the relief of all living things despite other Buddhas turning their backs against the relief of us, meaning the deadly, guilty living things.'
No Buddha could reach enlightenment as Buddha without ultimately depending on Amidabutsu.
The phrase Tariki (Other-Power) Hongwan originated from this, and has been generally used in the sense of 'selfish dependence on others' or 'irresponsible,' in the broad sense.
However, Other-Power here originally showed the power of Amidanyorai, while all other powers except his (but including Shaka's power) are called Jiriki (Self-Power).
Particularly in the Jodo Shinshu sect, an ignorant, deluded person with earthly desires can become Buddha 'only' by Amidanyorai's Hongwan, as it were, or Tariki Hongwan (absolutely Other-Power), and even the power of Shaka as Buddha is denied as 'Self-Power.'
In Tibetan Buddhism, 無量寿仏 is distinguished from 無量光仏.
Amidanyorai in Japan is near to the latter.
Furthermore, Panchen Lama, the second rank of dGe lugs pa, is regarded as an avatar of 無量光仏.
According to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, he appears for the relief of the soul four days after death (next to Dainichinyorai, Ashukunyorai and Hoshonyorai).
It is the Buddha who appeared in Mahayana Buddhism, and there is a theory that it originates from an Iranian faith such as Zoroastrianism.
According to that theory, Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of light, is an original model of 無量光如来 and Zurvan, the god of immeasurable time, is an original model of 無量寿如来.
Additionally, there is a theory that the area of Iran, the original place of Zoroastrianism and the area of ancient Babylonia, which were fertile and flourished, served as the basis for the Western Land of Bliss.
Since the Kamakura period in Japan, the words and phrases related to Amidanyorai had been seen in fully flourished Jodo-kyo.
Ohako, one's favorite stunt
As mentioned above, since the eighteenth wish among the 48 wishes in Jodo-kyo is seen to be the most important, Ohako (i.e., the eighteenth) means one's favorite stunt.
Amidakuji, lottery
The origin of this word is that although Amidakuji at present is shown in parallel lines, formerly it was shown in radiating lines, which looked like the halo of an Amidanyorai statue.
Tariki Hongwan
As mentioned above, it is used to show irresponsibility or a lack of effort, as transferred from the original meaning.

Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva in Sanskrit) is one of the Buddhas of Buddhism.
It is called Jishi Bosatsu, as freely translated from the Sanskrit name.
Azana (字), another name, is Ajita and is translated as 無勝等.
He was born in Varanasi, India, studied under Shakabutsu and was given a clarification to become Buddha in the future.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a tower on a lotus and a wise bottle (suihei, a small water bottle).
Shushi, Shuji, Bija in Mikkyo is yu.
Miroku (Maitreya) is a Bosatsu who is promised to become Buddha next to Gotama Siddhartha (Shakamuni-butsu, Buddha at present); it is said that he appears in the future 5670 million years after Gotama Siddhartha's demise and will bring relief to many people.
It is said that he is presently in ascetic training (or that he preaches) at Tosotsuten; the belief in going to Tosotsuten of Miroku Bosatsu (上生信仰) after death was popular in China, Korea and Japan.
Generally, it is believed that Miroku appears 5670 million years later; such enormous years originating from the formula 4000×400×360＝576000000, based on the belief that the life of Miroku at Tosotsuten is 4000 years and a day at Tosotsuten equals 400 years in this world (it is thought that 576000000 years changed to 5670000000 years during a later age).
The other old Buddhism sutra asserts that he appears 3000 years later, so that the time when future Buddha appears is not certain in a precise sense; another thesis claims it's a metaphor for 'the distant future.'
It is said that Miroku Bosatsu appears as Brahman in this corrupt world, obtains enlightenment under the Ryuge-ju tree (竜華樹) after becoming a priest in the same way as Siddhartha, and brings people relief by preaching three times (which is called Ryuge-sankai, the three sermons at Ryuge).
There is a description in "Maitreyavyakaranas" that he brings relief to 9.6 billion people the first time, 9.4 billion people the second time and 9.2 billion people the third time.
Additionally, he is called Miroku-nyorai or Miroku-butsu by taking in advance the figure of appearance 5670 million years later in some cases.
The statue called 'Great Buddha of Trial' at Todai-ji Temple is 'the seated statue of Miroku-nyorai (wooden figure)', which is small at less than 40 cm high, but it looks heavy.
In the faith for Miroku, there are 下生信仰 as well as 上生信仰, and the former was more popular in China.
While 上生信仰 is a wish to be relieved again at Tosotsuten of Miroku Bosatsu, 下生信仰 is the faith that we have to be ready for Miroku Bosatsu's appearance 'at present' rather than 5670 million years in the future.
As opposed to 上生信仰, which is similar to the Pure Land Faith, 下生信仰 is a kind of eschatology and a hope for the savior's appearance such as that this world should be changed in accordance with Miroku's appearance (下生).
For this reason there were many examples in each period where 下生信仰 was utilized by dissident groups or 下生信仰 groups became anti-establishment.
大乗の乱 of the northern Wei dynasty and Byakuren sect in the northern Sung dynasty, the southern Sung, the Yuan, the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty were good examples of them.
During the age of civil war in Japan, the faith that Miroku Bosatsu would appear in this world was popular and the appearance of 'the world of Miroku-butsu' as Utopia in this world was expected.
Although it is a kind of messianism, it shows the strong idea of an agricultural people that considers Miroku as a spirit of grain and that the world of Miroku is a peaceful world with a good harvest of rice.
Based on this idea, the belief that Miroku's ship came from the Eastern sea spread along the coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean, which can be seen as a style of the Miroku Odori dance (弥勒踊り).
During the Edo period it was mixed with the faith for Fuji, and trainees of Fuji-ko and Jikigyo Miroku were seen from 1688 to 1703.
Additionally, it is pointed out that peasant revolts, particularly the revolt for social reform, was strongly influenced by the Miroku faith.
観弥勒菩薩上生兜率天経, Maitreyavyakaranas, 弥勒大成仏経 are in some cases called Miroku sanbukyo.
Additionally, in the Muryoju-kyo sutra of the Jodo sect, Shakamuni-butsu asked Miroku Bosatsu to preach the Hongwan (本願) of Amitabha Buddha against people in anguish of a later age.
Miroku Bosatsu appears as a future Buddha at the very early stage of Buddhism, and is described in the Agon-kyo sutra.
The concept of a future Buddha is thought to have developed from that of the "past seven Buddhas."
He was one of the founders of Yogacaravada, of India, who preached Vijnaptimatra around 300.
He was considered to be the same person as Miroku Bosatsu (mentioned above as a future Buddha) in a legend of a later age.
His works are "Yugashijiron," "Daijo-shougonkyoron," "中弁分別論,""現観荘厳論," "法法性弁別論," and so on.
In Tibet it is said that Yugashijiron is made by Muchaku Bosatsu and Kukyoichijohoshoron is made by Miroku Bosatsu, while it is regarded to be made by Kenne Bosatsu (堅慧) in a translation of Chinese.
Another thesis asserts that Miroku Bosatsu was created by incorporating the sun god ミスラ, who had been admired in Western Asia and believed in as Bosatsu, so that its character as the savior stemmed from this.
ミスラ has the same origin as Mitra, which is one of the gods of Aditya (アーディティヤ神群) in Indian mythology and was a god of contracts who was admired in the ancient Aryan civilization.
In Zoroastrianism it is one of the middle-class gods, Yazata, and it has an important role as a hero and sun god.
On the other hand, in ancient Greece and Rome it was called ミトラース and was admired as the sun god and a hero.
In Kusana, ミスラ was called Miiro, a name of Bactrian origin, and it is thought that this form of the word became the origin of Miroku.
Although Miiro's character as a god is not known other than as the sun god, Akira SADATAKA assumes that it had a character as a savoir, considering the influence of Manichaeism.
Miroku's Sanskrit name 'Maitreya' has the same origin as the name of ミスラ神.
Mitra/miθra' originally meant only 'contract' but later meant 'a sworn friend' with an intimate relationship by contract.
Maitreya means 'amicable, friendly and merciful (person)' in its derived adjective and noun.
Milk god
In Okinawa Miroku Bosatsu is called 'the milk god' or 'Milk-san,' and the belief in Miｒoku is popular.
In a festival, the milk god who wears a mask of milk walks around with a smile.
It is pointed out as being related to Hotei-son, which was considered to be an incarnation of Miroku Bosatsu.
While in India Miroku Bosatsu was shaped as a statue having suihei in his hand, in China it was shaped as a statue sitting cross-legged on a chair until the Tang and was shown as a corpulent figure of Hotei, an incarnation of Miroku after the Yuan and Ming dynasties.
On the other hand, during the Asuka period in Japan it was shaped as a hanka-shiyui image (半跏思惟像).
It is a figure meditating with the right foot on the left knee and the right hand softly on the cheek, being seated on a chair.
The gold-and-bronze statue of Yachu-ji Temple in Osaka (an important cultural property) is the oldest hanka-shiyui image having the inscription 'Miroku Bosatsu.'
The Miroku Bosatsu statue of Koryu-ji Temple in Kyoto (a wooden statue) is especially well known and is designated as a national treasure (see Bangasayusang).
However, a hanka-shiyui image is not always a statue of Miroku Bosatsu.
In the Heian and Kamakura periods, no hanka-shiyui image would be seen, but standing or seated images were produced.
The wooden statue of Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto, made by Kaikei, is a good example.
The statues of Miroku Nyorai, such as the wooden statue of Todai-ji Temple in Nara (known as the 'Great Buddha of Trial,' an important cultural property) mentioned above, and the statue of Taima-dera Temple Kondo (made during the Nara period and now a national treasure) and the wooden statue shaped by the Unkei group of Kofuku-ji Temple Hokuendo (a national treasure) are known.
Aum Maitreya svaahaa
The priest Hotei-son, who is known in Japan as one of the seven deities of good luck, is considered to be an incarnation of Miroku in China; he is enshrined and depicted as a relaxed figure with a smile and a fat stomach, as Miroku Nyorai appeared in this world at the front of the Buddhist hall.
The Nichiren chant is the words of Namu Myohorenge-kyo, which are recited in the Buddhist religious services held by religious organizations such as Nichiren and the Hoke-kyo Sutra sect.
It is also called Odaimoku.
Originally, it meant a title and five letters of Myohorenge-kyo (translated by Kumaraju), constituting the translated title (phonetic equivalent) of Hoke-kyo Sutra, and it is called the 'Nichiren chant' even when the two letters of Namu (meaning "of becoming a believer") are added.
Additionally, Odaimoku is sometimes used in the sense of public stance or in nominal terms.
They are diverted from the meaning mentioned above.
Both meanings are described below.
What is Nichiren chant?
Nichiren chant (title) of Hoke-kyo Sutra Part 1, Volume 8, Chapter 28, which Kumaraju translated into Chinese characters, consists of five letters, 'Myohorenge-kyo (妙法蓮華経).'
Namu Myohorenge-kyo' means to become a believer in the rule (Buddhism) and the teaching of Myohorenge-kyo (the Hoke-kyo sutra).
The training needed to recite Nichiren chant continuously is an ascetic training by which to declare one's belief in and willingness to follow the teaching of the Hoke-kyo sutra.
The continuous recitation of five or seven letters of Nichiren chant (which are translated into Chinese characters) is regarded as being the same pious act as reading and practicing all sutras.
Namu' is pronounced 'Namo,' 'Naamo' or 'Namasu' in Sanskrit.
Moreover, from the viewpoint of a person who tries to regard the Nichiren chant of five Chinese characters as Myogo (Amida's name) of the Original Buddha, the way of practice on teaching in five letters of the Nichiren chant is not Volume 8 Chapter 28 but instead the seven-letter Nichiren chant, which is, 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo (南無妙法蓮華経).'
The Tendai sect in the mid-Heian period came to recite the Nichiren chant already affected by the invocation of the Buddha's name, but it simply didn't incorporate Nichiren chant into dharma.
Nichiren in fact incorporated Nichiren chant into dharma for the first time.
Details of each sect
The ascetic training to recite 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' continuously is called 'Shodai (唱題（しょうだい）).'
The Hoke-kyo sects call this 'Shodaigyo (唱題行)' as 'Shogyo(正行（しょうぎょう）)' among various kinds of ascetic training and accord it the highest value.
Other types of ascetic training, such as standing under a waterfall, fasting or keeping silent are called 'Jogyo (助行（じょぎょう）)' and are regarded as auxiliary measures.
When believers of the Nichiren sect (mainly Icchi-ha sect) recite the Nichiren chant, they pronounce 'Namumyohorengekyo.'
Believers of the Fujimon-ryu sect (Nichiren Shoshu sect) and Soka Gakkai, which is a lay religion, pronounce 'Nanmyohorengekyo.'
Additionally, in the Buddhist religious services of Nichiren Shoshu sect there is a manner called 'Hiki-daimoku' other than Shodai, in which way each sound is recited longer as 'Na-mu-myo-ho-ren-ge-kyo.'
Although it is not seen now, a few years ago believers of Soka Gakkai recited by extending the sound of 'ren' as 'Na-mu-myo-ho-re-nge-kyo-na-mu-,' but Nikken Hoshu recites it as 'Ren-.'
Meanwhile, Nichinyo Hoshu has recited in the same way after 登座 (unknown at the time he was a chief priest).
Moreover, Buddhists respect the number three, such as three treasures, three studies and three secret processes so that the way of 'reciting the Nichiren chant three times' is used broadly at the beginning and end of Buddhist religious services or memorial ceremonies as a means of showing respect to the main image.
While believers of the Nichiren sect lineage recite each phrase in one breath, such as 'Namumyohorengekyo, Namumyohorengekyo, Namumyohorengekyo,' believers of many Fujimon-ryu sect lineages recite the first and second phrases continuously and recite the third phrase after taking in a breath, such as 'NamumyohorengekyoNamumyohorengekyo, Namumyohorengekyo.'
However, Fuji Taiseki-ji Kensho-kai is an exception among the Fujimon-ryu sect lineages; it adopts an original way of pronunciation as 'Nanmyo, Hoi-re-nge-kyo, Nanmyo, Hoi-re-nge-kyo, Nanmyo, Hoi-re-nge-kyo' and a manner such as 'making a bow twice while reciting 'Nanmyohorengekyo' twice in small voice, reciting the Nichiren chant three times, reciting the Nichiren chant three times again, and bowing twice in the same way as the first' (called 'greeting'), the origin of which is unknown.
The difference between the invocation of the Buddha's name and reciting the Nichiren chant
The invocation of the Buddha's name by the sects of the Pure Land faith is considered to mean that Amitabha Buddha comes forth from people's mouths in order to let people know they can go to paradise by Amida's true wish, and they place a high value on it as the thing that gives people peace of mind.
It is also regarded that living with that peace of mind is a true joy and relief, and that reciting 'Namu Amidabutsu' doesn't require pious acts but is instead a type of training to show gratitude.
Shakanyorai, 'Namu Syakamuni-butsu,' in 'Myogo (Amida's name),' which is recited in the invocation of the Buddha's name, is considered a real person in authentic history.
However, there is no other Nyorai in history.
For this reason there is a view that denies the existence of 'Amidabutsu' of 'Namu Amidabutsu' as a fictional, imaginary figure.
On the other hand, some people think that 'Amidabutsu' was preached by the historical Shaka as having no figure, being immeasurable and showing eternal 'truth,' so that Shaka's true intension is included in 'Amidabutsu.'
On the contrary, Shodai in the sects of the Hoke-kyo faith has an affirmative directivity (directivity for this world) to survive in this world, because they think this world is important.
(However, directivity for this world is not inherent with the Nichiren sects but is seen in the Shingon and Tendai sects.)
The Nichiren chant recited in Shodai is the title of a sutra, so that a subject of faith exists as a sutra.
Nichiren described that each letter of the sutra should be considered as a gold Syakuson.
Even if the letters of a sutra do not look like Nyorai as might be expected, they can at least be seen as letters.
Hoke-kyo (Myohorenge-kyo), when written in Chinese characters, can be seen as the enumeration of Chinese characters at least so that its existence as letters gives people peace of mind.
Even if the content of a sutra is fictional or a lie, it can be said that the letters of the sutra exist clearly and are the truth.
What is Odaimoku?
Odaimoku is sometimes used in the same sense of Nichiren chant mentioned above, but in other cases it is used without religious meaning.
Odaimoku, in that case, often means one's public stance or nominal terms and implies 'being different from the actual condition.'
For example, it is used such as 'to act seriously, not only with Odaimoku.'
Hokke-kyo (Hokke-kyo Sutra) is a collective term for the Mahayana Buddhism sutra, 'saddharmapundariika-suutra ('a white lotus flower as right teaching)' in Chinese translation.
When the character '経' is excluded, '法華' remains, which is generally pronounced 'Hokke.'
The meanings of 'saddharmapundariika-suutra' are as follows: sad means 'right,' 'strange' and 'good'; dharma means 'teaching' and 'truth'; pundarika means '因果倶時 and pure white lotus'; and suutra means 'a sutra that Buddha preached.'
It is said that there were 16 kinds of translations to Chinese for this sutra, but currently the following three translations remain complete: "the Lotus Sutra" (translated by Hogo JIKU, Zhu Fahua in the second century), ""(translated by Kumaraju in the fifth century), "添品妙法蓮華経"(translated by Jnana-gupta and Dharmagupta in the seventh century).
In the countries where Buddhism sutras were translated into Chinese, "Myohorenge-kyo" (translated by Kumaraju) was considered to be 'the best translation' and was used as the essential sutra for Tendai sects and many other sects, so that the name 'Hokke-kyo sutra' is in some cases used as an abbreviation for 'Myohorenge-kyo.'
Moreover, Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumonhon No. 25 of "Myohorenge-kyo," as translated by Kumaraju, has become widespread as the Kannon-gyo sutra.
Hokke-kyo sutra consists of 28 chapters.
According to Chigi's teachings (Tendai Daishi), which are widely used at present, the first 14 chapters are called Shakumon (the Trace Gate) and the last 14 chapters are called Honmon (the Source Gate).
Shakumon describes that Buddha appeared as a tentative figure in this world in order to teach people, and Honmon describes that Shakamuni did not become Buddha under the lime tree for the first time but had been Buddha since ancient times.
Shakumon was compared to the moon reflected on the water, and Honmon was compared to the moon shining in the sky.
Many sects depend on and use this theory, although there are some differences such as that the Tendai sect and Hokke sect Icchi-ha put the same high value on Shakumon and Honmon, while the Hokke sect Shoretsu-ha places a higher value on Honmon of Hokke-kyo in particular, regarding Honmon as the superior part and Syakumon as the inferior part.
Additionally, from the point of Sanbun, Hokke-kyo can be divided into three parts (one sutra of three parts) such as Jobun (Johon), Shojubun (from Hobenbon to the first part of Funbetsuhon) and Ruzubun (from Funbetsuhon to Kanbotsuhon).
And if it is subdivided (two sutras of six parts), each Shakumon and Honmon is divided into Jobun, Shojubun and Ruzubun.
The first part is called Shakumon and states that Nijo can become Buddha (二乗作仏) over Mahayana Buddhism, as taught by the Hannya-kyo sutra.
Nijo is a person with higher income and good deeds from the living things, and there is a description that a wealthy Bosatsu worshiped Buddha with followers, so that various kinds of people served to embellish Hokke-kyo majestically around Buddha.
Additionally, it showed the teaching of egalitarianism as 'all people can be Buddhas some day' from the values of that time, like 未来成仏(悪人成仏) of Daidatta, and emphasized this through representations such as the appearance of a treasure tower in which Tahonyorai appeared and clarified the correctness of Hokke-kyo, 虚空会 and 二仏並座.
There is a viewpoint of 'passion play,' which forecasts that the priests who believe this teaching and are in charge of missionary works are inevitably oppressed by the public, which are common in Semitic monotheistic religions such as Judaism and Christianity.
The last part is called Honmon, which is described in Kuonjitsujo (久遠実成).
It mainly states that Shakamunibutsu was not awakened in this world for the first time but had already become Buddha in an immeasurable past time.
This led to a dispute on Honbutsuron (本仏論.)
From the viewpoint of Honmon, Buddha is not simply an individual, historical shaka.
Once a life begins to learn the Hokke-kyo sutra, it enters the path of belief despite the difficulties and will open its immeasurable ability.
It describes that the way of life itself is called Buddha.
Therefore, the length of life is understood to last forever in an immeasurable future over the superficial life and death.
Therefore, this corrupt world is a place in which Buddha, who has eternal life, always exists and guides people to relief forever.
It describes that the teaching that 'all people can inevitably become Buddhas someday' is not only a logic or an ideal but a fact with a definite promise.
Additionally, it describes that the one who hears this dharma (such as Buddha) is an existence having eternal life but can attain large good deeds only by believing it joyfully (一念信解・初随喜).
The subjects of dharma range from Bosatsu to others in all kinds of settings.
As a dharma (Buddhism) to guide stupid people during the Age of the Final Dharma, it describes 末法弘教の付嘱 against Jiyu Bosatsus such as Jogyo Bosatsu and the protection of believers of the Hokke-kyo sutra and practical benefit in this world by the force of Kanzeon Bosatsu, etc.

Seven parables are described in the Hokke-kyo sutra.
This is based on an episode in which Shakabutsu preached to people using parables, and each chapter of the Hokke-kyo sutra adopts this style in order to be easily understood.
This is also called Hokke Shichiyu or Shichihi.
The parable of the three carts and the burning house (Hiyuhon)
The parable of the wealthy man and the poor son (Shingehon)
The parable of the medicinal herbs (Yakusoyuhon)
The parable of the gem and the magic city (Kejoyuhon)
The parable of the gem in the jacket (Gohyakudeshijukihon)
The parable of a brilliant gem in a king's top-knot (Anrakugyohon)
The parable of the excellent physician (Nyoraijuryohon)
The Hokke-kyo sutra is considered to have been established more than 500 years after Shakuson's demise, and it is generally estimated as dating from 50 B.C. to 150 B.C. in the present study of Buddhism.
Therefore, the Hokke-kyo sutra isn't a direct teaching of the historical Gotama Siddhartha (Shaka) as well as other Mahayana sutras, but instead it describes that '外道の論議を説くと謂わん' as mentioned above, that is, in the Age of Final Dharma, more people could not believe the Hokke-kyo sutra and criticize it as a heresy (an idea that was not preached by Buddha, 非仏説).
Additionally, there is a theory that this sutra suggested the social situation faced by the religious organizations that edited this sutra.
Moreover, since many episodes such as Hokke Shichiyu (above) are included in the Hokke-kyo sutras, another theory guesses that it was made by a religious organization that had many believers.
The philosopher Hajime NAKAMURA guesses that the oldest limit of age when Hokke-kyo sutra was written must be 40 B.C., judging by the situation of a dying wealthy man who took an interest in finance, as described in the parable of the wealthy man and the poor son; because there could not be such a wealthy man who was not only a wealthy man but also a capitalist and was scared by kings and utilized them, unless it was in the age when money economy became much more developed.
Additionally, Shoko WATANABE pointed out that it could have been produced in a society that had less influence by Brahmanic culture, judging from the parable that someone who was a garbage man for 20 years was, after 50 years in exile, told that he was the successor of a wealthy man; because there was a strong caste system centered in Brahmin of Indian society since ancient times, so that this parable wasn't realistic.
This sutra had been disseminated widely in the eastern part of Eurasia before it was conveyed to Japan.
There are many editions in Sanskrit, partly because it was widely disseminated in India.
In the translation by Kumaraju, it omits mantra (Shingon) and in (印).
These are added in 添品法華経.
It was also translated into Tibetan, Uighur, Tangut, Mongolian, Manchurian, Korean (onmun) and so on.
These translations show that this sutra had been extensively read and recited.
The Chinese Tendai sect regarded the Hokke-kyo sutra as the most important sutra.
Chigi (Tendai Daishi) of Tendai-san Kokusei-ji Temple in Zhejiang, China, depended on the sutra "Myohorenge-kyo" written by Kumaraju.
Because there is a piece of plate on which the Hokke-kyo sutra is written at Shosoin in Japan, it seems that the Hokke-kyo sutra has been popular since ancient times.
There is a description in Nihon Shoki that Prince Shotoku had a lecture on Hokke-kyo sutra in the year 606.
The Crown Prince had a lecture on Hokke-kyo sutra at Okamoto Palace.
The Emperor was very pleased and gave him about 100 hectares of rice fields in Harima Province.
Therefore, the Crown Prince paid it to Ikarugadera Temple.'
(Vol. 22, Empress Suiko No. 14)
In 615 Prince Shotoku described "Hokke Gisho," a commentary of the Hokke-kyo sutra (see 'Sangyogisho').
Since the time of Prince Shotoku, Hokke-kyo has generally been regarded as a sutra that is linked by fate to Japan from the standpoint of being the guard of the nation as well as one of the most important sutras of Buddhism.
The Tendai sect, which was introduced to Japan by Saicho, was greatly admired by the Imperial Court until the Meiji Restoration.
Empress Komyo, who was the empress of Emperor Shomu, built 'a temple that can cancel crimes (法華滅罪之寺（ほっけめつざいのてら）),' calling it a 'provincial nunnery' and believed in the Hokke-kyo sutra.
Saicho, of the Tendai sect, named his sect the 'Tendai Hokke sect' and regarded the Hokke-kyo sutra as the supreme dharma.
The Hokke-kyo sutra played an important role in the new Buddhism of Kamakura.
Ryonin, a founder of the Yuzu nenbutsu sect, which recites Yuzu Nenbustu (融通念仏), insisted on the invocation of the Buddha's name as a pioneer of the later Buddhism of Jodo-sect lineage, and regarded the Kegon-kyo and Hokke-kyo sutras as major sutras (正依) but considered the Three Sutras of the Pure Land, the Jodosanbu-kyo sutra, to be minor sutras (傍依).
On the other hand, Honen, a founder of the Jodo sect, as well as Shinran, a founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, and others regarded the Three Sutras of the Pure Land as major sutras because they thought that the relief of an ignorant, deluded person was written in it, but nothing critical of the Hokke-kyo sutra has been seen.
It could be said that Kuonjitsujo of Amitabha Buddha was influenced by the Hokke-kyo sutra.
Dogen, a founder of the Soto sect, insisted on mediation of '只管打坐' as a way to implement enlightenment but continuously tried to find theoretical evidence in the Hokke-kyo sutra.
The sutra he read in dying was Nyoraijinrikihon of Hokke-kyo Sutra.
Nichiren's appearance made a theoretical lineage to try to establish the status of the Hokke-kyo sutra as 'the supreme sutra of Buddhism' and 'the right dharma (正法) (妙法)' appear more radical.
Nichiren recited the Nichiren chant of 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' (唱題行) and became a founder of the Hokke sects by teaching that an ignorant, deluded person could have the ability to become a Buddha through belief in Myohorenge-kyo and could trace the path to true enlightenment.
By this teaching, a belief in the Hokke-kyo sutra spread among people throughout Japan.
The Hokke sect of Nichiren studies (日蓮教学) placed high value on the five letters of 'Myohorenge-kyo (妙法蓮華経)' in this sutra's title (a formal title of the sutra translated by Kumaraju in Chinese) and considered the recitation of Namu myohorenge-kyo (a chant of five letters or seven letters) as 正行.
During modern times the Hokke-kyo sutra also influenced many writers and thinkers, mainly through Nichiren.
It could be said that the common point among modern famous Hokke-kyo sutra believers' lives without regard to leftism or rightism was their unyielding rejection of petit bourgeois glory and the effort to obey only their ideal.
It is said that Kenji MIYAZAWA (a poet and author of children's stories), Chogyu TAKAYAMA (a thinker), Giro SENO (a religious thinker), Ikki KITA (a rightist revolutionary) and Kanji ISHIWARA (a warrior and staff person in the Kwantung army) were well-known examples.
After the defeat in World War II in 1945, some sects that believed the Hokke-kyo sutra were forced to change their interpretation on dharma, such as a description on the ability of women to become Buddhas in accordance with the intension of the Occupation Army.
Some sects that place high value on the Hokke-kyo sutra as the essential sutra adopt Chigi's teaching that the Hokke-kyo is the secret of Shaka's dharma, 正法（妙法）, which was said to be preached by Shaka in his later years.
On the other hand, in the philology there is a theory that the Hokke-kyo sutra was written by a religious organization that was opposed to the monopoly by full-time priests of Hinayana around the beginning of the A.D. epoch or the end of the B.C. epoch.
Considering the results of philology whereby the Hokke-kyo sutra was edited a few centuries later than the age in which Shaka lived, the ways of thinking between Japan and other Mahayana Buddhism countries are different.
According to the traditional Japanese religious sects, Mahayana sutras such as Hannya-kyo, the Nirvana sutra and the Hokke-kyo, which was considered to have been written in a later age by other sects, are not rootless because it's possible for disciples of existent religious organizations to succeed and develop their master's dharma.
They tend to insist on such eclectic theories that later sutras can be admitted as 'Shaka's dharma' because they have developed in the process of inheriting Shaka's teaching orally, from disciple to disciple.
There is, however, a theory that the religious organizations and believers of other Mahayana Buddhist countries such as the Eurasian states of China, Nepal, Tibet, Butan, Mongolia, Buryat, Tuva, Kalmyks and Taiwan do not accept this result of philology, which doesn't represent a major problem, but the reason for that theory isn't known.
The Buddhist invocation is generally to recite 'Namu Amidabutsu' as a devotional exercise in the Jodo-kyo sects of Pure Land teachings.
It can be roughly divided into three in the history of Buddhist doctrine.
In early Buddhism, a tenacious belief in Buddha (憶念) was called Buddhist invocation.
修定 of Buddhism is basically understood as stopping all conscious activity.
隨念 is a way to stop all other conscious activity by concentrating on a specific subject when it is difficult to stop conscious activity.
見仏' which makes Buddha Body (仏身) (色身) a subject of tenacious belief, 'meditation' and '観仏', which are observation in jhana samadhi (禅定三昧), became to be included in Buddhist invocation.
With the emergence of Mahayana Buddhism, it was regarded as an important ascetic training (Buddhism) to admire the virtue of Buddhas and hold a mass.
Therefore, Buddhist invocation in samadhi was regarded as that training.
The Tendai sect performs Jogyo-zanmai as ascetic training at Jogyo-do (Jogyo-zanmai-do, Hanshu-zanmai-do)of Mt. Hiei-zan.
In the practice of Jodo-kyo in China, there are two streams of Buddhist invocation.
Kanso Nenbutsu (観相念仏)' (to ponder the figure of Buddha)
Byakuren-sha of Eon, Zenkan Nenbutsu (禅観念仏) of Jimin, etc.
The Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra (meditation sutra), in which Kanso Nenbutsu is described, are not seen in the books translated into Sanskrit or Tibetan, and there are theses that it was edited in China or Central Asia, so that Kanso Nenbutsu was a mainstream at the early stage of Jodo-kyo in China.
In Japan, Kanso Nenbutsu was mainstream in Nara Buddhism (the Hosso sect) and Heian Buddhism (the Tendai sect).
In Ojoyoshu, written by Genshin (a priest), Kanso Nenbutsu was accorded high value and was therefore popular among aristocrats during the Heian period.
Given that influence, the style of architecture and art by which to show the Pure Land and Amida-triad (such as Byodoin Temple in Uji and Chuson-ji Temple in Hiraizumi) developed during the Heian period.
While Jokei recommended Kanso Nenbutsu of Shaka, he criticized Senshu Nenbutsu (専修念仏) of Honen.
Invocation of the Buddha's name (a so-called Buddhist invocation)
Particularly, Zendo insisted that a tenacious belief in Buddha and the invocation of the Buddha's name were the same, and recommended the invocation of the Buddha's name.
It did not need to mediate Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land in particular, so architected spaces (temples and halls) and religious arts (statues and pictures of Buddha) were not necessary either.
Therefore, since anyone could recite Buddha's name without regard to time or space, it contributed to the prevalence of Buddhist invocation among people from various walks of life.
The stream of invocation of the Buddha's name was taken over by Ryonin, a founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, at the end of the Heian period in Japan, and the invocation by the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect recited 'Namu Amidabutsu' and was later called Dai Nenbutsu (大念仏).
In the Jodo sect, which was founded by Honen, Senju-nenbutsu (meaning the single-minded recitation of 'Namu Amidabutsu') has been incorporated and taken over by the Jodo Shinshu sect founded by Shinran, from the same lineage.
Odori Nenbutsu is to recite Buddhist invocation and songs, dancing while beating a drum or ringing a bell.
It is said to originate from Kuya.
In the Kamakura period, when Ippen of the Jishu sect visited Tomono of Shinano Province (Saku City, Nagano Prefecture), he performed Odori Nenbutsu after the example of Kuya.
At about the same time, Shunjo IKKO, a priest of the Jodo sect in Kyusyu, performed Odori Nenbutsu independently of Ippen.
After these events, priests of the Jishu and Ikko-shu sects (meaning the lineage of Shunjo IKKO as opposed to the Jodo Shinshu sect, later the Jishu Ikko-ha sect) came to perform it in missionary work, whereby it spread throughout the country.
It had a significant influence on Bon Odori dance, Nenbutsu folk dances and the kabuki Odori dance, as begun by IZUMO no Okuni.
Tendai Sect is a sect of Mahayana (greater vehicle) Buddhism.
Its fundamental sutra is Lotus Sutra.
It originated in China and was introduced into Japan by Saicho in the early Heian period.
Chinese Tendai Sect is a sect of Mahayana Buddhism, and its eventual founder was Chigi (538 - 597, Tendai Chisha Daishi) who was active in the Sui period.
Its first and second founder was Emon of Hokusei and Kozan Eshi (515 - 577) respectively and Chigi was Eshi's disciple (it is also said that the 1st founder was Ryuju, the 2nd was Emon, the 3rd was Eshi and the 4th was Chigi)
Chigi was a scholar priest who originated a doctrine based on Hokke-kyo sutra, Makahannya haramikyo sutra and Daichidoron (Commentary on the Great Wisdom Sutra) that were translated by Kumaraju as well as Nehangyo sutra, advocated Kyoso hanjaku (theory on the history of sutra establishment) based on Goji hakkyo, which deems Hoke-kyo sutra as paramount, and preached to become Buddha through shikan (Tendai Meditation).
However, there are views asserting 'Hoke-kyo sutra translated by Kumaraju is substantially different from the existent Sanskrit version and in particular, Hobenbon daini, which Tendai Sect emphasizes might have been modified based on Kumaraju's own doctrine.'
In view of the fact that Kumaraju attached importance to Hoke-kyo sutra, Makahannya haramikyo sutra and Daichidoron, it can be said that the foundation of the Tendai Sect was triggered by Kumaraju.
After its basis was established at Mt. Tendai, it absorbed the Nehan Sect and the Tendai Sect was finally established.
Chigi's Hokke gengi (Essentials of the Lotus Sutra), Hokke mongu (Commentary on the Lotus Sutra) and Makashikan (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation) are collectively called Sandaibu (the three important scriptures) and are deemed as the essence of Tendai Sect Buddhism.
Shoan Kanjo (561 - 632), 4th founder, recorded and compiled these writings by Chigi.
After Kanjo, the sect was succeeded by Chii (? - 680), Kanjo's disciple, followed by Ei (634 - 713), Chii's disciple, and Sakei Genro(673 - 754).
As the influence of Tendai Sect declined after Kansho, Sakei Genro is assumed as the 5th founder.
Keikei Tannen, 6th founder, who was a disciple of Genro and is deemed as the beginner of the restoration of Tendai Sect, wrote many books concerning the doctrine of the Tendai Sect, including Sandaibu.
Its official name is the Tendai Hokke En Sect.
Sometimes it is called the Hokke En Sect, Tendai Hokke Sect or simply Hokke Sect.
However, the last one is seldom used because it could be confused with Hokke Sect of Nichiren kyogaku (religious doctrine advocated by Nichiren).
The writings related to the Tendai Sect were initially brought into Japan by Ganjin Wajo, who was a priest of the Ritsu Sect as well as the Tendai Sect.
Then, Denkyo daishi Saicho (767 - 822) traveled to Tang (805), visited Mt. Tendai, learned the doctrine of the Tendai Sect, returned to Japan (806) and founded the Japanese Tendai Sect.
At that time, Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara), such as the Hosso Sect and the Kegon Sect, had already been introduced into Japan, but in China, they were the sects that were founded later than Tendai Sect.
After returning to Japan, Saicho came back to Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei and since then, he nurtured many Buddhist monks including Ennin and Enchin.
As Saicho advocated the doctrine of Hokke ichijo which asserted all people were able to become Buddha, disputes arose between Nara Buddhism (Nanto rokushu) which stuck to the position of Theravada Buddhism.
In particular, the debate conducted between the Tokuitsu of the Hosso Sect is well-known.
His innovative initiatives to establish Daijo kaidan, recognize monks who received Daijokai (the commandment of Mahayana Buddhism) as Tendai Sect monks and train them as Bosatsuso (priests of Mahayana Buddhism) by containing them in Mt. Hiei for 12 years deepened the confrontation between Nara Buddhism, which monopolized, due to vested interests, and Kaidan-in which were authorized to grant Shojokai (commandments of Theravada Buddhism) brought by Ganjin Wajo.
As Daijokai was deemed at that time as commandments for secular people, not for Buddhist monks (even at present, Daijokai is not recognized as Buddhist precepts under Theravada Buddhism, such as Sri Lanka Theravada Buddhism), the refutation by Nanto (Nara) priests might be reasonable in light of the common sense that then prevailed.
As a result of disputes, imperial sanction concerning Daijo kaidan was given after Saicho's death and the Tendai Sect was formally established, both in name and substance, as an independent religious sect.
While Mikkyo of the Shingon Sect is called Tomitsu, that of the Tendai sect is called Taimitsu.
Religious sects that deem Nichiren to be the real Buddha in the Mappo era criticize the current Japanese Tendai Sect asserting that it is close to the Shingon Sect because it has substantially incorporated the elements of Esoteric Buddhism and the teaching of Mt. Hiei was distorted by Ennin and Enchin because they incorporated Shingon Esoteric Buddhism after Saicho's death and against his will.
In considering the above, however, several points, including historical situation, should be taken into account.
When Tendai daishi Chigi, who is said to be the founder of Tendai Sect in China, advocated Kyoso hanjaku (also called Kyohan for short) based on Goji hakkyo, in which he systemized Buddhism as a whole according to the doctrine of Hokke-kyo sutra, Esoteric Buddhism had not yet been introduced and therefore, it was not included in Kyohan.
However, Esoteric Buddhism, the latest Buddhism at the time, had already been introduced when Denkyo daishi Saicho, the founder of the Japanese Tendai sect, traveled to Tang.
As Saicho worried that Japanese Esoteric Buddhism was imperfect, he received Kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) of Esoteric Buddhism from Jungyo and returned to Japan with the intention of systemizing Buddhism as a whole, including Esoteric Buddhism.
When Kukai returned from Tang one year later after Saicho had returned, Saicho recognized that the Esoteric Buddhism he had learned in Tang from Jungyo was collateral and asked Kukai with the utmost courtesy to take him in as a disciple in order to study Esoteric Buddhism, but he eventually parted from Kukai due to their differences in views on Buddhism.
Due to the above, incorporation of perfect Esoteric Buddhism into Tendai kyogaku was stopped.
However, there is no doubt about the fact that Saicho intended to establish the doctrine of comprehensive Buddhism by integrating Buddhist precepts based on Hokke-kyo sutra, Zen, Nenbutsu (Buddhist prayer) and Esoteric Buddhism and his disciples, including Ennin and Enchin, succeeded Saicho's will, restudied Esoteric Buddhism and completed Tendai kyogaku which had been the earnest desire of Saicho.
Therefore, it can be said that the origin of the current Tendai Esoteric Buddhism is not Ennin and Enchin but Saicho himself.
Further, as Enchin pointed out 5 defects in Kukai's 'Jujushinron' (Ten Stages of Mind Development) and refuted it as 'there is no superiority or inferiority between Tendai and Shingon,' the views held by sects which deem Nichiren to be the real Buddha that Ennin and Enchin distorted Tendai by incorporating Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, is completely denied by the above fact.
The difference between Shingon Esoteric Buddhism (Tomitsu) and Tendai Esoteric Buddhism (Taimitsu) is that while Tomitsu advocates its doctrine with Dainichi nyorai being its principal image, Taimitsu takes the stance of Hokke ichijo with Shakamunibutsu of Kuon-jitsujo (eternal life of the Buddha), which is the principal image of Hokke-kyo sutra, being its principal image.
In view of the above-mentioned, it is pointed out that the Japanese Tendai Sect founded by Saicho is, in spite of the same name, a different one from the Chinese Tendai Sect which is based on Hokke-kyo sutra and founded by Chigi, and although it succeeds Chigi's doctrine and is based on Hokke-kyo sutra, it is a unique one that tried to fuse the elements of Zen, Buddhist precepts, nenbutsu and Esoteric Buddhism or the one that tried to develop Chigi's Tendai kyogaku while succeeding it.
Therefore, Enryaku-ji Temple is also called dojo (a hall used for training) for Shishu kengaku.
Ascetic training of the Tendai Sect emphasizes 'Shikan,' which is based on Hokke-kyo sutra and could be said to be Hokke Zen.
Ascetic training of the current Japanese Tendai Sect can be summarized in the words of "asa daimoku, yu nenbutsu" (read the Lotus Sutra in the morning and pray to Amida Buddha in the evening).
In the morning, Buddhist monks practice daimoku, namely gyoho of chanting Hokke-kyo sutra (it is called hokke senbo) and in the evening, they practice gyoho of praying to a principal image Amida Buddha (it is called reiji saho).
Shikangyo developed further in later years and became the first step of the development of new Buddhism called 'nenbutsu.'
The sect strengthened its basis by conducting incantation of Tendai Esoteric Buddhism (Taimitsu) and becoming comprehensive Buddhism (there is doubt and criticism concerning the reason why the sect needed to conduct nenbutsu and/or incantation if it believed the doctrine of Hokke-kyo sutra was right).
Furthermore, in later years, the sect established the Tendai hongaku philosophy, which asserts that Buddhist nature dwells in all beings.
As the sect played a leading role in the education of Buddhism in Japan, many scholar monks who advocated new religious sect doctrines, such as the Yuzu Nenbutsu Sect, the Jodo Sect, the Jodo-Shin Sect, the Rinzai Sect, the Soto Sect and the Nichiren Sect, were turned out from the sect from the end of Heian period to Kamakura period.
Bosatsu, or Bodhisattva (in Sanskrit) is a disciplinant who wants to become Buddha (tries to become Nyorai) in Buddhism.
Later Bosatsu, in spite of a disciplinant, became a target of people's belief because it was considered to live with people and lead people to Buddha's teaching.
Summary
It came from the phrase "bodhi-sattva" in Sanskrit.
Bodhi means 'awake,' and sattva means 'a living person' so that it was freely translated into 'the living things' or 'humanity.'
For this reason he is referred to in the two senses of 'a person who pursues enlightenment' and 'a person who has awakened' so that there are two kinds of Bosatsu in India, while in China 'an Indian Mahayana Buddhism monk' is also called Bosatsu.
As a result, there are three kinds of Bosatsu.
However, merely seeking enlightenment leads to the same as Shomon, Engaku and Bykakushibutsu, so that in order to avoid this, the Hannya-kyo sutra, a Mahayana sutra of the early stage, added Bodhisattva Mahasattva (菩薩摩訶薩) and Mahasattva (摩訶薩) (the great living thing) and differentiated Mahayana Bosatsu.
Additionally, in the Hannyashin-kyo sutra translated by Genjo there is a word, '菩提薩埵' in the latter part, which is said that it was intentionally divided into '菩提' and '薩埵' according to nirukti.
In the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra, Daihannyaharamitta-kyo Sutra translated by Genjo, it was described as Bodhisattva Mahasattva (菩薩摩訶薩).
After the idea of Bosatsu was established, the rank of Bosatsu was produced next.
This had been segmented and structured in accordance with the development of Mahayana Buddhism, but various theories emerged according to the interpretation of sutra.
In "Kegon-kyo Sutra" and "Sutra of the Fundamental Vows of the Jeweled Bodhisattva," the status or grades of training were divided into 52 ranks, ranging from Myokaku, Tokaku, Jicchi (Ten Stages), Jueko (Ten Transferences), Jugyo (Ten Behavioral Activities), Juju (Ten Dwelling), Jushin (Ten Faith), and from this 52 ranks have often been adopted.
Myokaku
The last position of the 52 ranks for Bosatsu training, Bosatsu in Tokaku rank, gets this rank by overcoming Mumyo, abidya, of Ippon.
It is also a rank with overcoming Bonno (earthly desires), and is seen as being the same as Buddha and Nyorai.
Tokaku
It is the fifty-first rank and one of the highest of the 52 ranks for Bosatsu training, and it means that its wisdom and virtue become equal to those of Myokaku, a Buddha of 略万徳円満.
Jicchi, Juchi, Ten Stages
From the forty-first through fiftieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks from the highest are as follows: dharma-cloud, the finest wisdom, unperturbed state, afar practice, open mind, mastery of utmost difficulty, glowing wisdom, illumination, purity, and joy from the upper rank.
It was named '地', 'a land' because it can be compared to a land putting on all things and giving benefit to them that Bosatsu gets the wisdom of Buddha, keeps holding without moving, bears the burden of all living things, teaches them and gives them benefit.
Jueko, Ten Transferences
From the thirty-first through fortieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks from the highest are as follows: Transference of equalizing the boundless dharma realm; Transference of the liberation without any tie nor attachment; Transference of the mark of true suchness; Transference of viewing all sentient beings in equality and harmony; Transference of the good roots of equality and harmony; Transference of the store of boundless virtues; Transference of reaching everywhere; Transference of equalizing all Buddhas; Transference of non-destruction; and Transference of salvaging all sentient beings but detaching from any form of sentient being.
They are the ranks in which a disciplinant does (廻施) all selfish and altruistic training that it had already done for the living things and tries to reach an enlightenment (仏果) by putting this good deed after Jugyo.
Jugyo, Ten Behavioral Activities
From the twenty-first through thirtieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks, from the highest, are as follows: manifesting in all things the pure, final and true reality; perfecting Buddha's law by complete virtues; exalting the paramitas among all beings; unimpeded; appearing in any form at will; never out of order; without limit; never resenting; beneficial service; and joyful service.
This is the rank where Bosatsu tries to relieve the living things in order to complete more altruistic training after getting a certification (印可) as a Buddhist (仏子) at the end of Juju.
Dana - Generosity, charity, giving of oneself; Sila - Morality, purity of conduct; Ksanti - Endurance, forbearance, patience; Virya - Diligence, zeal; Dhyana - Meditation, mental concentration; Upaya - The ways and means of emptiness and detachment; Pranidhana - Spiritual vows; Bala - Spiritual Powers; Jnana - Spiritual wisdom
Juju, Ten Dwellings
From the eleventh through twentieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks from the highest are as follows: Kanjo, Abhiseka; Being the prince of the law; Being Buddha's son; Non-retrogression; The whole mind as Buddha's; Perfect expedience; Acquiring the seed of Tathagata; Unobstructed cultivation; Clear understanding and mental control; Setting objectives.
It is called '住' in the sense that the mind of the disciplinant lives in Shintai, the real truth after Jushin.
Another theory asserts that Jicchi of Bosatsu should be called Juju.
Jushin, Ten Faiths
From the first through tenth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks, from the highest, are as follows: Vow, Precept, Reflexive power, Non-retrogression, Concentration, Wisdom, Zeal, Remembrance, and Faith.
This is the rank where a disciplinant has no doubt regarding the belief in Buddha's dharma.
Additionally, Jushin names generically the gebon, (i.e., outer stages) the ranks from Juju to Jueko (called naibon, i.e., inner stages or the three virtuous positions) and the ranks from Jushin to Jueko (called 凡).
Juchi and Tokaku names 因, Myokaku names 果, and the ranks from Juchi to Myokaku name 聖, which are in opposition to 凡
Suppositional idea
Although there could be various reasons behind the development of the Mahayana Buddhism movement, it can be thought to be a movement that emerged due to the fact that any Hinayana priest who performed the ascetic practices of Shomon could not become Buddha.
It was thought that there were two reasons for that, and the disciplinants who could not become Buddha were called as follows:
Shomon, who was awakened by Buddha's teaching
Engaku or Byakushibutsu, who did not preach in spite of reaching enlightenment by itself
Early in Mahayana Buddhism, these were called two vehicles and were regarded as being unable to become Buddha.
Bosatsu as a disciplinant
From the early stage of Buddhism, Buddha in the disciplinant age before enlightenment was called Bosatsu.
In Jataka, Shaka's previous life story, a figure of Shaka's previous life was also called Bosatsu.
What was created as a representative of this Bosatsu was Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva), who was said to become Buddha next.
Miroku Bosatsu is considered to appear in this world as 弥勒仏 after ascetic training for 5670 million years.
Amitabha Buddha, which later became Amitabha Buddha, is a representative example.
Bosatsu for working in this world
Despite having reached enlightenment already, Bosatsu, who was prohibited from becoming Buddha, was created.
This is because it was thought that the activity of Buddha itself had a restriction, so that a person who worked for Buddha hand and foot, as it were, was called Bosatsu.
Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu, of the Amida triad, are examples of this.
They are not only symbols of Shaka's functions but also work as functions themselves.
Additionally, Kanzeon Bosatsu and Seishi Bosatsu are Bosatsu who work without regard to becoming Buddhas.
Mahayana priest in India
In China, since the details of the Indian situation were not heard, the priests of the early Mahayana Buddhism were given honorific titles, of Bosatsu in particular.
Ryuju Bosatsu, Seshin Bosatsu and others were examples in this case.
Miroku Bosatsu needs attention.
There were Miroku Bosatsu created as Bosatsu in Isshohusho (一生補処, the rank where a disciplinant could become Buddha by one more reincarnation) and Miroku who were told to edit Yugashijiron (there is another opinion that another person edited it but that Miroku was asked to pretend to be an editor (仮託説)).
Bosatsu in Japan
In Japan it was a subject of faith.
The following major Bosatsu were greatly admired: Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu, who is depicted as a mother; Miroku Bosatsu who relieves people in the far future; Fugen Bosatsu, who appears in the Hokke-kyo sutra, which says women can become Buddhas and has been deeply admired by women; Monju Bosatsu, who controls the wisdom; and Zijo Bosatsu, who is at the roadsides and nearest to the grass roots.
Syncretization of Shinto with Buddhism
As a stage of syncretization of Shinto with Buddhism there came the idea that the god of Japan hoped to escape from crime and achieve enlightenment as well as human beings.
Based on that idea, Bosatsu-go (菩薩号) was used as a name of the god of Japan who came to believe in Buddhism.
The Hachiman deity is representative of that.
Titles of high priests
In some cases the Imperial Court gave high priests the Bosatsu title.
Gyoki Bosatsu is an example in this case.
This article describes the history of Hongwan-ji Temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect, founded by Shinran.
On November 28, 1262 (old lunar calendar), Shinran, a founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, fell ill at Zenpo-bo of Sanjo Tominokoji and entered nirvana at the age of 90.
His funeral was held at 8 p.m. on the next day, the 29th.
Kenchi of Takada Shimotsuke Province, Senshin of Ikeda Totomi Province and others came up to Kyoto and participated in the funeral.
His body was cremated at Ennin-ji Temple, located in the south of Higashiyama Toribeno.
On the 30th his born was collected.
His grave was built at Otani, located in the north of Toribeno, and his born was placed in the grave.
In 1272, the Otani Mausoleum was built in what is now the Rinka-cho, Higashiyama Ward (around Sotaiin, the north of Chion-in Temple's gate), the living place of Kakushinni, Shinran's youngest daughter, and Shinran's portrait was placed there.
It is thought that the temple where Shinran's portrait was placed should be called Hongwan-ji Temple, after a transfer of the temple.
Kakusinni was in charge of Rusushiki, who preserved it.
After that, her descendants were deemed to be successors, which later became a basis of inheritance by Kechimiyaku (血脈), a bloodline or lineage of succession, of Hongwan-ji Temple.
Rusushiki was succeeded by Kakushinni and then to Kakue and Kakunyo.
Emperor Kameyama (who reigned from 1259 to 1274) gave the title of "Kuon Jitsujo Amida Hongwan-ji Temple," but the mausoleum was ultimately destroyed because of infighting.
In 1312 the third Rusushiki Kakunyo rebuilt Mausoleum as a temple, Senju-ji Temple.
(Moreover, there is no direct relationship to Takada Honzan Senju-ji Temple of the same Jodo Shinsu sect.)
However, it changed the name to Hongwan-ji (Otani Hongwan-ji Temple) in accordance with the protest of the Mt. Hiei-zan priests.
Kakunyo tried to integrate all disciples of Shinran under Hongwan-ji Temple.
He wrote "Kuden-sho" and described that the teachings of the Jodo Shinshu sect were transferred by word of mouth from Honen to Shinran, from Shinran to his grandson Nyoshin, and from Nyoshin to Kakunyo.
This showed that Kakunyo, a chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple, succeeded Shinran in the point of dharma as well.
However, in reality it was difficult to establish an independent religious organization in Kyoto as opposed to established temples such as Enryaku-ji Temple, which acquired economic power over the years and in some cases had military forces.
Before the Showa era it was oppressed in 1330, 1352 and 1388, and while other schools of Jodo Shinshu sect spread in eastern Japan and elsewhere, only Hongwan-ji Temple declined and was permitted existence on the condition of loyalty to Enryaku-ji Temple and the forbiddance of Buddhism invocation as a subtemple of Shorenin, which was influenced by Enyryaku-ji Temple.
At that time, the Jodo Shinshu sect was not integrated into the Hongwan-ji Temple group.
Other groups were scattered throughout Japan.
The Takada, a lay follower group (門徒) (based in Senshu-ji Temple), the Araki group and the Wada group were lineages of Shinbutsu and Kenchi.
The Kashima lay follower group, the Date group and the Yokosone group were influential as well.
Particularly, the Takada lay follower group flourished.
Also, Ryogen's group developed by using '名帳' and '絵系図' based in Bukko-ji Temple of Kyoto.
The chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple was succeeded by Zennyo, Shakunyo, Konnyo, and Zonnyo after Kakunyo.
During this period, Hongwan-ji Temple gradually became influential, centered in Omi Province and the Hokuriku district.
In 1390, Shakunyo, the fifth chief priest, built Zuisen-ji Temple (Nanto City) in Inami, Ecchu Province (Toyama Prefecture).
Konyo, the sixth chief priest, was also engaged in missionary work at Hokuriku, centered on Zuisen-ji Temple.
In the succeeding era of Zonnyo, it became more influential and Hongwan-ji groups were established in Omi Province (Shiga Prefecture), Kaga Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), Noto Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture), etc.
In Hongwan-ji Temple, 御影堂 and Amida-do were built.
However, it is said that these constructions put pressure on the financial condition of Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1415, Rennyo was born as the first son of Zonnyo.
He became a monk at Shoreiin Temple when he was 17.
His posthumous name was Kenji, and his priestly name was Rennyo.
In 1449, at age 35, Rennyo went to Hokuriku with his father Zonnyo.
Rennyo scattered the remains of Shinran to far Oshu for worship, and civilized lay follower groups.
On June 18, 1457 (old lunar calendar), Zonnyo entered nirvana at the age of 62.
Nyoenni, Zonno's wife, tried to make her son Rensho succeed as the chief priest, but instead Rennyo became the eighth chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple, supported by Nyojo, Zonnyo's brother.
At that time Rennyo was 43.
When Rennyo became the eighth chief priest, Hongwan-ji Temple declined and lost its status as the central temple of the sect, whereupon it became a subtemple of Shorenin Temple.
Around this time, Kyoto was seething from the Tsuchi Ikki (peasant riot).
Two years later there occurred a severe famine, and many people starved to death in the region of the Kamogawa River.
Many provinces were caught up in war, showing the seriousness of the situation.
Society developed gradually, and the grass roots increased in power.
Farmers improved their status through the increase of productivity in villages and the decline of lords of the manor, so that soon they were able to create autonomous villages (惣村).
Rennyo responded to this social situation quickly, and he energetically undertook missionary work.
Lay follower groups that sympathized with Rennyo's enthusiastic mission work spread from Kinki to the Tokai district.
Especially in Omi (Shiga Prefecture), many people believed Rennyo so that 無碍光本尊 was worshiped in many villages.
This greatly stimulated Enryaku-ji Temple, of the Tendai sect in Mt. Hieizan.
In 1465, Otani Hongwan-ji Temple was destroyed by priest soldiers of Mt. Hieizan.
In 1471, Rennyo escaped from Kyoto to Omi in order to avoid trouble, and moved to Yoshizaki Gobo in Echizen (Fukui Prefecture).
In 1475, Rennyo withdrew Yoshizaki Gobo in order to calm the unrest, and he undertook aggressive missionary work based in Deguchi of Kawachi (Osaka Prefecture).
As a result, many priests and lay people of the Jodo and Shodo sects came to believe in him.
In 1478, Rennyo moved from Deguchi to Yamashina and began to build Hongwan-ji Temple in January of the next year.
In 1483, halls such as 御影堂, Amida-do were completed, along with the main house.
(Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple)
In 1488, a riot group established a republic, 'a country ruled by farmers,' in Kaga Province.
Jinaimachi, Temple Town, were established by building both a temple and many grass-roots houses around the temple.
In this country, many visitors who made pilgrimages to the temple and many people of various occupations gathered, so that it flourished more than Kyoto City.
Hongwan-ji Temple's teachings spread throughout Japan, from Hokkaido Prefecture to Kyusyu.
Furthermore, the Khitan came to Japan from the northern part of China in order to learn the teachings.
Through the efforts of Rennyo, Hongwan-ji Temple became one of the largest religious organizations in Japan.
In 1489, Rennyo was 75.
He passed over Hongwan-ji Temple to Zitunyo.
In 1496, Rennyo was 82.
On September, he began to build a vihara in Osaka.
In 1497, Rennyo was 83.
Once the vihara in Osaka was complete, he went into retirement there.
(Osaka Gobo)
The place name 'Osaka' first appeared in Chapter 4, Section 15 of Rennyo's "Epistles of Rennyo Shonin (Gobunsho)" as of November 22, 1498, according to historical sources.
Although I do not know what kind of promise I made in ancient times, it has been three years since I saw this village, Shonai Osaka in the Ikutama Higashinari district of Sesshu, at the end of fall 1496, and built a vihara.
I think this must be a destiny that is closely connected to ancient times.'
In the spring of 1499,
Rennyo got worse.
on February 20 (old lunar calendar), he returned to Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple.
On March 25th (old lunar calendar), Rennyo entered nirvana.
Hongwan-ji Temple during the Sengoku period (oppression and forbiddance of lay follower groups by Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period))
The 100 years of the ninth Jitsunyo, the tenth Shonyo and the eleventh Kennyo were the chaotic age of civil war.
Hongwan-ji Temple supported the freedom movement which the grass roots requested in opposition to rulers, serving as the ideological driving force of social reform.
During that period, Hongwan-ji Temple became more influential and established itself as one of the largest religious sects as well as a strong social group.
In 1500, 照如 entered nirvana at the age of 22.
From 1504 to 1521
Lay follower groups in Kaga (Ishikawa Prefecture) stepped into the internal problems of the Asakura clan in Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture).
In 1504, the Go-Hojo clan in Sagami Province (Kanagawa Prefecture) prohibited belief in the Jodo Shinsu sect in the province, a prohibition that continued for 50 years.
In 1506, lay follower groups of Hongwan-ji Temple rose in revolt in the Kinki, Hokuriku and Tokai districts, all at roughly the same time.
In 1507, Masamoto HOSOKAWA was murdered as a result of trouble over clan succession.
Hongwan-ji Temple, which had had a close friendship with Masamoto since Rennyo, was afraid of becoming involved in that conflict so that Jitsunyo and Shinran's portraits were instead taken to Omi Katada.
They stayed there for nearly two years.
In 1516, it became an official temple of Emperor Gokashiwabara.
In 1521, the Nagao clan in Echigo Province (Niigata Prefecture) oppressed the lay follower groups of Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1521, Ennyo, the second son of Jitsunyo, entered nirvana at the age of 32.
On February 2, 1525 (old lunar calendar), Jitsunyo entered nirvana at the age of 68.
In 1532, it helped Harumoto HOSOKAWA and defeated the Hatakeyama clan with 20,000 troops of lay follower groups in the Kinki district.
In August of the same year, a coalition force of the Nichiren sect and Sadayori ROKKAKU of Omi burned down Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple.
(Hokke Ikki Riot (法華一揆))
It moved to the vihara in Osaka Ishiyama (Osaka Gobo).
(Osaka Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple)
In 1541 it had a peace conference with the Asakura clan.
In 1553, Kagetora NAGAO (Kenshin UESUGI) was reconciled with Hongwan-ji Temple in order to maintain a route to Kyoto.
On August 11, 1554 (old lunar calendar), Kennyo became a priest.
He was 12 years old.
On August 13, 1554 (old lunar calendar), Shonyo entered nirvana at the age of 39.
In 1556 it concluded a peace treaty with the Asakura clan.
In 1559, Kennyo was ordained as Monzeki, a temple in which resided a member of the nobility or the Imperial Family.
The Shimotsuma clan became 坊官 and Mikawa Honshu-ji Temple, Harima Hontoku-ji Temple, Kawachi Kensho-ji Temple (Yao City) became 院家.
In 1563, Hongwan-ji Temple's lay follower groups of Mikawa Province (Aichi Prefecture) fought against Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, but a year later they made peace.
Subsequently, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA oppressed and prohibited Hongwan-ji Temple lay follower groups in the province.
It was in 1583, 20 years later, that he ceased forbiddance.
The Shimazu clan in Satsuma (Kagoshima Prefecture) continued to forbid such groups until 1868.
In 1568, Nobunaga ODA went to Kyoto.
In 1569, Kosho-ji Temple, which was founded by Kenson, the second son of Kennyo, was ordained as Waki Monzeki (a subtemple in which resided a member of the nobility or the Imperial Family).
In 1570, Nobunaga ODA, whose goal was the integration of Japan, ordered Hongwan-ji Temple to withdraw from the moated castle city Ishiyama, a the headquarters of the Jodo Shinshu sect's lay follower groups and a strategic point against western Japan, which led to a war (the Ishiyama War).
It continued for about 10 years.
Sometime after the Ishiyama War, Hongwan-ji Temple came to be called Ishiyama Gobo.
In March 1581, Kennyo made peace with Nobunaga.
He withdraw from Ishiyama and moved the foundation of the temple to Saginomori Kii Province (Kii Saginomori Hongwan-ji Temple.)
The halls and buildings of Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple were all burned down.
In 1583, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI built Osaka-jo Castle at the place that included the old site of Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1583 it moved to a subtemple of Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple at Kaizuka, in Izumi Province (later Gansen-ji Temple (Kaizuka City)), along with Shinran's portrait.
(Kaizuka Hongwan-ji Temple)
In May 1585, it moved to Temma in Osaka and obtained a donation of land for a temple from Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.
In August of the same year, Amida-do was built first, and the following August 御影堂 of about 18 square meters was built.
(Osaka Temma Hongwan-ji Temple)
In 1591 came another donation of land for a temple from Hideyoshi; 御影堂 and Amida-do of Hongwan-ji Temple were built at the place where Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple now stands.
On November 24, 1592 (old lunar calendar), Kennyo entered nirvana at the age of 50.
Kennyo and his first son Kyonyo were opposed to each other over the end of the Ishiyama War.
After Kennyo's nirvana, Kyonyo succeeded as the chief priest.
Moreover, Kyonyo retired based on an assignment document and Junnyo succeeded as the twelfth chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1602, Ieyasu donated land for a temple to the east of Hongwan-ji Temple.
The next year, Kyonyo built a hall and placed a wooden image of the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect from Myoan-ji Temple in Hitachi Province (Ibaraki Prefecture), which led to the establishment of another Hongwan-ji Temple.
Subsequently, more lay follower groups came to believe in Kyonyo, and thｒough repeated meetings and partings of lay follower groups the Hongwan-ji Temple groups were divided roughly in half as the eastern group and the western group.
For more than 400 years since then, both groups have continued their missionary work at the present places.
Godai Myoo (the five great Myoo) is a subject of faith in Buddhism and a combination of the five Myoo, which play a central role among Myoo, an honorific entity, which is specific to Mikkyo Esoteric Buddhism.
Myoo, which were originally produced as independent honorific entities, are arranged around Fudo Myoo.
In images such as statues and pictures, often Fudo Myoo is placed in the center, Gozanze Myoo at the east, Gundari Myoo at the south, Daiitoku Myoo at the west and Kongoyasha Myoo at the north.
Moreover, this arrangement is seen in Mikkyo (Tomitsu), which has been transmitted in the Shingon sect, but in the other Mikkyo (Daimitsu), which has been transmitted in the Tendai sect, Ususama Myoo is included in Godai Myoo instead of Kongoyasha Myoo.
Statues of the Godai Myoo were actively produced in Japan, while in China a few works were made.
In Japan, Mikkyo was very popular during the first stage of the Heian period, and Godai Myoo was enshrined as the principal image of Buddha in the Godanho ritual.
As a representative example in Japan, the statue, which was made in the first stage of the Heian period and is located at the auditorium of To-ji Temple, is well known (as a national treasure).
It is estimated that the statues was made around 839, when the auditorium was built.
As for the festivals related to Godai Myoo, Godairikisonninnoue is famous, and Kyoto Daigo-ji Temple performs it in February of each year.
In this festival, the power of Godai Myoo is magnified by burning a large ritualistic 'Saito Goma' outside, and on the last day the contest of strength by holding up a big Kagami-mochi of 150 kg has been held as a traditional event.
An ama is an unmarried woman over the age of 20 or a woman who becomes a priestess after the period of Shamini (a female Buddhist novice), even though she has been married.
She is also called Bikuni.
A nun of Christianity is also called Ama in some cases.
The type of woman who had her hair cut around shoulders was called 'Amasogi,' and girls with such a hairstyle were called 'Ama' in some cases.
Additionally, in recent times the word 'ama' was used in reference to a prostitute girl or woman.
The origin of the word 'ama' could be considered a transcription of the slang expression of 'ambaa' in Sanskrit, which means 'a good woman.'
Originally it meant Bikuni (bhikSuNii in Sanskrit) and a female Buddhist disciple opposite Biku, a male Buddhist disciple.
According to tradition, the first Bikuni were Makahajadai, Mahaprajapati, (Mahaaprajaapatii in Sanskrit), Shaka's adopted mother, and 500 women of the Shaka clan.
Shaka did not permit women to become priestesses at first, but admitted them based on their passion and meditationof Anan (Ananda) on the condition that they would keep eight promises, such as respecting Biku without slander.
By this, Yashotara (Yashodhara), Shaka's ex-wife, Bhadraa-Kapilaanii, ex-wife of Daikasho (Mahakasyapa), and Sama (Ksemaa) who was the princess of Bimbisara, Sister Uppalavanna and others became priestesses one after another and established a priestess group.
In Japan Ama generally means a woman who becomes a priestess, shaves her head, puts on clerical garment and practices ascetic training at Ama-dera Temple.
They are called Ama Nyudo, Ama Nyobo, Ama Goze or Ama Midai and so on.
The first ama in Japan were three women including Zenshin-ni, a daughter of Tatto SHIBA, who SOGA no Umako made them become priestess in 584.
They crossed to Kudara in order to learn Buddhism precepts (戒法), and lived at Sakurai-ji Temple after their return to Japan in 590.
At the beginning of Buddhism in Japan, the ama seemed to play the same role as a shrine maiden who worshiped God.
In 741 provincial monasteries were built around the country by an order of emperor Shomu, and provincial monasteries were built at the same time.
However, in accordance with the idea of the guard of nation becoming stronger, people tended to dislike that women (including ama) approached Buddhism from the standpoint of emphasizing that priests kept the precepts of Buddhism.
Therefore, giving Buddhist precepts (授戒) against ama was rejected and ama had been denied as priestess in Buddhism society for a long time in spite of the fact that there were many ama at that age.
Against this situation, Princess Shoshi, the empress of Emperor Junna, tried to make Kaidan (Ama Kaidan), the Buddhist ordination platform for women, but due to objections she could not.
FUJIWARA no Shoshi (a daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga), of the Palace of the Empress of Emperor Ichijo, placed Ama Kaidan at Hojo-ji Temple, which was built by Michinaga, when she became priestess in 1027, but it was lost in the devastation of the temple.
In medieval times, aristocratic women could become 'ama' called Sage Ama by having her hair cut around shoulders (of course they couldn't become ama formally because they could not be given the precepts of Buddhism).
Subsequently this custom became widespread, and women who were bereaved of husbands, divorced or had grown old were called 'ama' based on their appearance.
For example, Masako HOJO, a wife of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, became an ama and was called Ama Shogun because she wielded influence over government.
Kamakura new Buddhism regretted the former position to depreciate women and preached to relieve women, and Honen showed deep sentiment against Ama Nyudo, which was seemed to be a slang term for fools, as it were.
In addition, Eison built Ama Kaidan at Hokke-ji Temple, which was the Great Head Temple of old provincial nunneries, when it was rebuilt (in 1249).
Influenced by the missionary works of his Shingon Risshu sect, giving Buddhist precepts to ama had been gradually admitted.
In the Kanakura and Muromachi periods, Ama Gozan was determined in Kyoto and Kamakura.
A private shrine maiden, married with an itinerant Buddhist monk of Shugen, performed worship and divine revelation together, and also adopted the custom of having her hair cut so that a Shugen shrine maiden was called Bikuni.
Such bikuni went around the country, which led to the creation of the Haooyaku-bikuni (Yao-bikuni) legend.
Kumano-bikuni, who propagated the Kumano faith in various places, lectured on Rokudo-zu (i.e., paintings of the six paths of existence) are also called the "six realms" of reincarnation or Kumano Mandala (i.e., devotional paintings of the three shrines of Kumano).
During the Edo period, Uta Bikuni who served at a banquet appeared and some ama fell into prostitution.
Ama was seen in nearly every Buddhist sect in Japan, but after the Meiji Restoration the values of patriarchal authority based on Confucianism became widespread among people other than those of the former warrior class, so there was an example that ama was abolished, such as occurred in the Nichiren Shoshu sect in the Showa period, when nationalism also became influential.
Arakan (arhat in Sanskrit) is a saint in Buddhism who is eligible to receive respect and charity.
It is a transcript of "arhan," the nominative of "arhat" in Sanskrit.
It is also abbreviated as Rakan.
It is translated into 応供 (Ougu) in Chinese.
It was one of the honorific titles of Shaka.
For details on the temples that enshrine Arakan, see Rakan-ji Temple.
It is also called 殺賊 (Setsuzoku), transferred from killing (殺す (han)) rebel (賊 (ari)) of earthly desires and '不生,' transferred from a（不）＋ruh（生ずる), which means not to relive in a wandering world (past, present and future existences, or three realms) after nirvana, but these are vulgar views of the origin of word.
It is originally a derivative word of the root, arh-, which means 'valuable', 'respectable' and so on.
Originally, in the general sense it meant 'respectable disciplinant' in the Indian religion.
In early Buddhism it meant the top level that a disciplinant could attain.
Arakan-ka, the state of full attainment of arhatship in which it isn't necessary to learn any more, is called 'Mugakui (無学位).'
As for the grades below that, Fugen-ka (the consummation of the stage of the non-returner), Ichirai-ka (one who has fully consummated the stage of the once-returner) and Yoru-ka (one who has fully attained the stage of the stream-enterer) are called 'Ugakui (有学（うがく）位).'
(Shiko Shika, four accesses and four accomplishments)
Especially in Mahayana Buddhism, Shomon was called Arakan and was distinguished from Buddha critically.
However, in Mahayana Buddhism it is referred to as two vehicles, and Arakan and Dokkaku are said to be unable to become 'Buddha.'
Additionally, there is a theory that they cannot even go to 'Hell' but must repeat reincarnation at the same level.
In China and Japan, 16 disciples who swore to keep Buddhism were respected as the 16 Rakans.
Moreover, 500 disciples who gathered in the first editorial meeting of Buddhist sutra (結集（けつじゅう）were called the 500 Rakans and were eagerly respected.
Particularly, the Zen sect emphasized that Shaka's true dharma　(正法) was transmitted directly to Arakan, Daikasho (Mahakasyapa) and produced pictures of the 500 Rakans, and statues of Rakan idealized the figures of Shaka's disciples training, which were later worshipped to pray for keeping true dharma.
According to "Daiarakan Nandai Shosetsu (Hojuki)," it means sixteen Arakans who live in this world forever by Buddha's order and serve as redeemers of living things.
Bindorabaradaja, Pindolabharadraja
The first of 16 Rakans
It is known as Binzuru-sonja or, in other words, Obinzuru-sama.

Sutra,' of the Buddhist sutra (Kyoten, Kyoden, sutra in Sanskrit, sutta in Pali), means a record of Shaka's teachings among Buddhist scriptures.
The way of ascetic training and religious precepts is called 'vinaya'; commentaries of Buddhist sutra are called 'abhidharma'; and sutra, vinaya and abhidharma are collectively called 'Tripitaka.'
Buddhist sutra' means only 'sutra' in a narrow sense, but in a broad sense it means all Buddhist scriptures.
In that sense it has the same meaning as Buddhist scriptures.
The major Buddhist sutras include Hokku-kyo Sutra (Dhammapada), Agon-kyo Sutra, Hannya-kyo Sutra, Yuima-kyo Sutra, Nehan-kyo Sutra (Sutra of The Great Nirvana), Kegon-kyo Sutra, Hokke Sanbu-kyo Sutra (Threefold Lotus Sutra), the Three Sutras of the Pure Land (Jodosanbu-kyo Sutra), Kongocho-kyo Sutra, etc.
It can generally be classified into primitive sutras and Mahayana sutras.
Primitive sutras include five sutras of Pali and the Agon-kyo Sutra group (as translated into Chinese), and it is said that portions of these sutras adhere relatively closely to Syakamuni's words.
The Mahayana sutras were created by Mahayana Buddhism religious associations beginning around the beginning of the A.D. epoch, so they have no direct relationship to the historical Syakamuni.
They include the Hannya-kyo sutras, the Hokke-kyo sutra, the Kegon-kyo sutra and others..
As for languages, there are various translations ranging from Indian dialects such as Pali and Sanskrit to Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian and Manchurian, and a part of the sutra written in the Tangut language remains as well.
They have been translated into Japanese from Chinese, and Pali is also included in this.
Additionally, sutra, vinaya, abhidharma and their commentaries were edited into a series called "Daizo-kyo Sutra (the Tripitaka)" or "Issai-kyo Sutra (Complete Buddhist Scriptures)."
These works were often implemented by order of the Emperor in China, where they set a tough standard to incorporate scriptures so that the scriptures that were not of the standard were called 'Zougai (蔵外).'
Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra, edited in Japan in 1934, generally includes scriptures edited or written in China and Japan.
Sutra (sutta) is a collection of Skaka's and disciples' records of sayings and deeds.
Once Shaka reached nirvana, in order to transmit his teachings correctly his disciples held a meeting to edit Buddhist sutras (Ketuju, 結集) and began to classify them.
However, from 100 to 200 years after Shaka's nirvana, the religious association split into many Hinayana, and each one came to succeed and keep its own Tripitaka.
Apparently, they were written in each respective language of the various regions in India.
Only the Pali Buddhist sutra of Theravada Buddhism, which was transmitted to Sri Lanka, exists in complete form; it is used widely in the Southeastern Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar.
The contents are as provided below:
Vinayapitaka: Kyofunbetsu (経分別, Commentary on the Texts of Religious Precepts), Kendo (けん度, Systems and Rules of Religious Associations) and an appendix.
Kyozo, storehouse of sutra: the five sections of diigha-nikaaya, majjhima-nikaaya, saMyutta-nikaaya, AGguttara-nikaa and khuddaka-nikaaya.
The former four sections correspond to "Agon-kyo Sutra," as translated into Chinese.
Abhidhamma-piTaka: the seven sections of DhammasaGgaNI, VibhaGga, DhAtukathA, Puggala-paJJatti, KathAvatthu, Yamaka and PaTThAna.
These were written gradually until around 2 B.C. - 1 B.C. and are said to have been transmitted to Sri Lanka around 1 B.C.; subsequently, many commentaries, essentials and history books of Zogai were produced.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Pali Text Society was founded in London and published a revised edition of original sutras, while in Japan the 65 volumes of "Nanden Tripitaka" (1935-1941), including some Zogai scriptures, were published as a complete translation.
It should be remembered that Pali Buddhist sutra haven't necessarily kept the original words.
In "Agon-kyo Sutra," as translated into Chinese, there are descriptions that are older than those transmitted to Theravada Buddhism or those that seem to have been translated into Chinese from Sanskrit.
In that sense, it is not only a false expression but also an incorrect one to think the Pali Buddhist sutra keep the original forms.
In Tibet, the translation of individual Buddhist scriptures was begun by order of King Songtsan Gambo in the seventh century; the translation of Buddhist sutra into the Tibetan language was begun by Tonmisanboda (トンミサンボータ).
In accordance with the ascendance of Buddhism as the national religion at the end of the eighth century, the translation of Buddhist scriptures became a national project of the kingdom; thus the work of collecting and translating Buddhist scriptures from India encyclopedically and systematically was begun and completed in the space of just a few decades.
In order to translate the original scriptures in Sanskrit, Tibetan grammar and vocabulary were set up, and due to the efforts of Shanyeshede (シャンイェシェデ), Kawaperutseku (カワペルツェク), Chokuroruigentsen (チョクロルイゲンツェン) and others it was completed in about 824.
As for the classification of Buddhist sutras in Tibetan Buddhism, separation into two parts--'Bkah-hgyur' and 'Bstan-hgyur'--was given more value than that into the three parts of 'sutra, vinaya and abhidharma,' which is common to other Buddhist countries.
Bkah-hgyur means 'hgyur (translation)' of 'Bkah,' i.e., Syakamuni's word itself, and Bstan-hgyur means 'hgyur (translation)' of 'Bstan,' i.e., a commentary of 'Bkah' by scholars of Indian Buddhism such as Ryuju.
In Tibetan, Buddhist sutras were for a long time widely distributed as manuscripts in order to reveal religious devotion, but in 1410 Emperor Yongle of China's Ming dynasty ordered the carving of wooden blocks of the Tripitaka as souvenirs for Tibetan feudal lords and religious associations that sent messengers to China; this custom was incorporated into Tibet and subsequently led to the carving of various Buddhist sutras.
Beijing edition: Bkah-hgyur of the Yongle edition (1410), Bkah-hgyur of Wanli (1606), Bkah-hgyur of the Kangxi edition (1692), Bstan-hgyur of the Yongzheng edition (1724)
Litang edition (1621-24)
NaTang edition: Bkah-hgyur (1732), Bstan-hgyur (1773)
Dege edition: Bkah-hgyur (1733), Bstan-hgyur (1742)
Lhasa edition: Bkah-hgyur (1936)
Moreover, in China since the 1990s as part of the Chinese Tripitaka project, which will be published in the Western style, Bstan-hgyur (including many manuscripts and editions of past times) has been edited.
The Tripitaka of Buddhist sutras in the above editions includes many commentaries on Mahayana Buddhism sutras, particularly late-stage Indian Buddhism documents of which the original scriptures and translations of Chinese do not exist, so that it has important meaning in the research of late-stage Indian Buddhism.
Tibetan translation is near to a literal translation of Sanskrit, and it is easy to deduce to original words, so that it is considered important to the research of original forms of Buddhist sutra that have been translated into Chinese, particularly when the originals no longer exist.
The rNying-ma School, one of the four major religious sects in Tibet, characteristically has many sutras and abhidharmas, which insist that Buddhist sutras (gter-ma) hidden underground during a certain time were after a long time discovered by predetermined gter ston (people who excavated hidden Buddhist sutras).
The discovery of gter-ma (hiding Buddhist sutras) has continued since the medieval period, but it is often considered as fiction by persons involved in excavation from other sects.
This sect has its own Tripitaka, the contents and composition of which are different from those of the above editions.
A project for the translation of Buddhist sutras in China was begun in the latter period of the second century and continued virtually without interruption until the end of the eleventh century.
In accordance with the progress of translation into Chinese, it became necessary to collect and classify the sutras of the Chinese editions and distinguish the true Buddhist sutras from the false ones, so that at the end of the fourth century Doan SHAKU wrote "Shuri Shu-kyo Mokuroku (亡佚)," the first record of sutra, and at the beginning of the sixth century Soyu edited "Shutsu Sanzo Kishu (the Chu sanzang ji ji)."
These 衆経 (or Tripitaka) were said to be called 'Issai-kyo Sutra' in the northern Wei dynasty, meaning the Pei dynasty (China), while they were called 'Tripitaka' in Liang (Nanchao), meaning the Nan dynasty (China); both titles were established in Sui and the beginning of the Tang dynasty, and the form of manuscripts were determined as comprising 17 letters in a line.
In the Sui and Tang periods many records of sutra were edited, such as "Daito Naitenroku" by Dosen, but what influenced later ages was the 20-volume "Kaigen Shakukyoroku," which was completed in 730 by Chisho.
Following the classification of Buddhist sutra since the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (China), this classified them into the Mahayana Tripitaka, Hinayana Tripitaka and Seiken Shuden (聖賢集伝) and decided that the number of Buddhist scriptures that should be edited into the Tripitaka as 5,048 volumes by designating Mahayana sutra as Godaibu (五大部) of Hannya, Hoshaku (宝積), Taishu (大集), kegon and nirvana.
the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (China)
The printing block of the first edition of the Tripitaka was carved at Shu (Sichuan Province) from 971 to 983 in the era of Kyoin CHO (Song Taizong) of the Northern Sung dynasty, and was printed at 'Sutra Printing Academy,' which was built in Kaifeng, the capital.
This was called 'the Tripitaka in Shu edition' in old times; today, however, it is generally called 'Kaihozo' based on the era name at the time of the first block or as the 'rescript edition' because it was carved by the founder's imperial rescript.
It was edited in "Kaigen Shakukyoroku."
It was a rolled book in which each line consisted of 14 letters standardized by 'Shu big letter book (蜀大字本)' at that time.
This was a project for good deeds by Sung, and was given to neighboring countries such as Xi Xia, Goryeo and Japan.
Chonen, a priest of Todai-ji Temple who went to Sung in 983, was given 481 boxes and 5,048 volumes of Tripitaka and 40 volumes of Buddhist sutras newly translated; he brought them back to Japan, but because they were placed at Hojo-ji Temple, which was built by FUJIWARA no Michinaga, they vanished in smoke along with the temple.
However, since it was hand-copied eagerly as the newly arrived Tripitaka, copies remain in various places.
Twelve original books of Kaihozo have been discovered worldwide, among which in Japan each book has been in the possession of Nanzen-ji Zen Temple in Kyoto and the Shodo Hakubutsukan Museum in Tokyo.
During the Jin period, the 'Jin edition' was produced from 1147 to 1173.
This was also written as 14 letters in each line.
It was for a long time a phantom Tripitaka, but in 1933 it was discovered at a temple in Chogi-ken, Shanxi Province.
For this reason it is also called 'Chogi-zo (趙城蔵).'
Since 1984, "Chuka Daizo-kyo Sutra (Chinese Tripitaka)中華大蔵経" (facsimile edition) has been published, having this Tripitaka as a copied text.
Additionally, during the Yuan period it had been repaired several times (repaired edition in Yuan).
The Tripitaka was carved in around 990 - 1010 by Kitai.
In the 16 prefectures of Yan Yun that were ceded to Kitai from Jin, it was published as a national project by referring to a text of Sekkyo (Sekkei) (The Scriptures Inscribed on Stone), which had been kept at Fangshan since the time of Sui.
Although this Tripitaka was a phantom Tripitaka as well as a Jin edition, the 12 volumes of the Kitai edition were discovered in 1982 from a Buddha statue located at the wooden tower in Bukkyu-ji Temple, an old temple at Yingxian, in Shanxi Province.
With this discovery it was confirmed that the Kitai edition had a relationship with Sekkyo of Fangshan, and it was verified to have been written following the standard form of 17 letters in each line.
From the Southern Sung to the Ming dynasty, private editions of the Tripitaka had been published in various places.
The first edition was 'Tokaku Zenin Temple (等覚禅院) edition' (1075-1112), which was begun at Tokaku Zenin Temple in FuZhou (Fujian Province) at the end of the eleventh century.
This was a project to publish a private edition through the dedication of believers, as opposed to publication as a national project like the Northern Sung dynasty edition or the Kitai edition.
After that, the following Daizo-kyo were published continuously: 'KaiYuanSi Temple edition' of FuZhou (1112-1151), 'Shikei-ban edition (思渓版)' of Huzhou (1126-1132), 'Shaseki-ban edition (磧砂版)' carved in Suzhou City (1232-1305), and the 'Puning edition' of Hang Zhou (1277-1290).
These lineages adopted the standard form of 17 letters in each line.
At the end of the Ming dynasty, 'Banreki-ban Daizo-kyo Sutra (Kinzan-zo) (万暦版大蔵経（徑山蔵）)' was published, having a new style of dual-page print as opposed to the former rolled book.
Ryuzo (龍蔵),' the Tripitaka of Ching and the above-mentioned Tetsugen edition and Manjizo (卍字藏) in Japan are classified as being of this lineage.
In Goryeo the reprinted edition of 'Kaihozo' was published in 1010 (Korai Hatsucho-bon, 高麗初雕本), and after its wood blocks were burned in a battle with Yuan forces it was carved again as Korai Saichobon (高麗再雕本) in 1236.
At this time, Shuso (Moriso, 守其), who was responsible for this edition and edited "Korai New Tripitaka Revision Record (高麗国新雕大蔵経校正別録)," revised the first edition by referring to the Kitai edition.
The revised book, "Tripitaka Koreana," the wood blocks for which are still housed in Haeinsa Temple, has a few false entries but is considered to be the best text that remains as an old form, so that it was adopted as a copied text in compact editions of Tripitaka in the Meiji and Taisho periods as well as the above-mentioned "Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra" because 'it is superior to other books' by conflating the Northern Sung dynasty edition with the Kitai edition.
However, Shuso conflated only the Kaihozo, Korai Hatsucho-bon and Kitai editions, and Kaihozo was original as opposed to the Korai Hatsucho-bon, which was a reprinted edition, so that their texts basically indicate the same lineage.
Therefore, he conflated only between the Northern Sung dynasty editions and the Kitai edition.
Later, in accordance with the progress of text critique, it came to be said that the reputation of 'the best text that remains an old form' was the illusion by 'the first published Tripitaka.'
In fact, the Tripitaka in the Scriptures Inscribed on Stone at Fangshan as well as in the Kitai edition, which were the local texts of places such as Beijing (in Hebei Province) and Shanxi Province, or the Southern Sung edition, 'Shikei Shifuku-zo (思渓資福蔵)' and Yuan edition, 'Funei-zo,' which were lineages of the Issai-kyo sutra manuscripts of Choan (the capital from the Han through Tang dynasties) are often better texts.
As opposed to those texts, there is a theory that the texts of 'Kaihozo (rescript edition)' and the 'Korean Edition (高麗版)' lineage keep only the contents of the Issai-kyo sutra, which was a lineage of manuscript spread throughout Shu (Sichuan Province).
However, another theory asserts that the edition of Choan, the center of Buddhism, had been reformed with each collection of manuscripts and became sophisticated as a text, so that the Shu edition of the local version has kept the original form adversely.
For example, regarding a description of the beginning of "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra" translated by Kumaraju, in Kaihozo it was written as "如是我聞一時 佛住・・・," while in 'Shikei Shifuku-zo' and 'Funei-zo'; but later, in 'Kinzan-zo,' it was written as "如是我聞一時婆伽婆住・・・," so that as this example shows, it was sometimes revised following the new style of Chinese Buddhist sutra that emerged during the era.
Additionally, in a printed book, "Taisho New Daizo-kyo," there is information on the castigation of such texts as the above 'Shikei Shifuku-zo' (Sung book), 'Funei-zo' (Yuan book) and 'kizan-zo' (Ming book) against a copied text of 'Tripitaka Koreana.'
For details on the Tibetan Tripitaka, see the article of 'The Tibetan Tripitaka.'
In Japan, the approximately 5,000 volumes that Genbo brought back in 735 were assumed to be the authorized Tripitaka at that time.
From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, "Issai-kyo Sutra in Sung Edition" was introduced to Japan through the efforts of priests who went to Sung, such as Eisai, Chogen Shunjobo and Keisei.
1648: The "Kanei-ji Temple edition (Tenkai edition)" was completed by Nankobo Tenkai with support from the Tokugawa shogunate.
1681: Doko TETSUGEN completed "the Obaku-ban Tripitaka (Tetsugen edition)."
It is famous because it was adopted in the textbook on morals (修身) in Japan before World War II as the Tripitaka that the Zen master TETSUGEN had completed through trials and tribulations, but it has errors in terms of the characters used, mostly among the successive Tripitakas.
This is because it was published based on the reversed and split actual text of the Tripitaka in the Ming edition.
1885: "The Dainihon Revised Tripitaka Compact Edition (大日本校訂大藏經縮刷藏本) (The Tripitaka in Compact Edition) (Tokyo Kokyo Shoin)" was published.
1902: "Manjizo"　(Kyoto Zokyo Shoin) was published.
1912: "Dainihon Zokuzo-kyo Sutra "(Nihon Zokyo-in) was completed.
Although it is criticized as having many insufficient castigations, what contributes to the world of Buddhism and the research on Buddhism is the 100 volumes of "Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra" (Taisho Issai-kyo Kanko-kai, 大正一切経刊行会) produced under the editorship of Junjiro TAKAKUSU and Kaikyoku WATANABE.
It took 10 years (from 1924 to 1934) to conflate various books with a copied text of Korean Haeinsa Temple, and it consists of Shozo (55 volumes), Zokuzo (30 volumes), Showa Hobo Mokuroku (three volumes) as well as pictures and images (12 volumes).
Buddhist sutras in Chinese were also translated into Japanese, such as "Kokuyaku Tripitaka," "Kokuyaku Issai-kyo Sutra (国訳一切経)," and "Showa Shinshu Kokuyaku Daizo-kyo Sutra."
Additionally, the text database of "Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra" of Tokyo University (SAT) and other projects such as the Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (CBETA) have been promoted in order to produce an electronic text of Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra, and they are open to the public with certain restrictions.
Jodo-kyo is a teaching for people to become Buddha in the Land of Bliss of Amitabha Buddha.
It is also called Jodo-mon (Gateway of the Pure Land) or Jodo-shiso.
The word 'Jodo' originated in China, but ideologically it was first modeled on the 'Buddha Lands' in the early Mahayana Buddhism of India, and each Jodo of many Buddhas was explained.
However, in China and Japan, in accordance with the prevalence of the faith for Amitabha Buddha, Jodo generally has meant Jodo of Amitabha Buddha.
The word 'Jodo-kyo,' which Zendo of the Tang dynasty described as 'I want to listen to Jodo-kyo carefully' ("Hojisan (Tengyogyodogan Ojo Jodo Hojisan)," is used in the same sense.
Jodo-kyo was established in the age when Mahayana Buddhism was evoked in India, and it started with the editing of "Muryoju-kyo Sutra" and "Amida-kyo Sutra" in around 100 A.D.
Over a long span of time, Jodo-kyo became widespread in India.
There exist many theories of Mahayana Buddhism on Amitabha Buddha and the Land of Bliss, among which the theories emphasizing the concept of a belief in Jodo after death are shown below:
"Jujubibasharon (Basharon)," which is said to have been written by Ryuju around 150-250, ('Igyo-hon No. 9' of Vol. 5 in all 17 volumes).
"Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge (Jodo-ron, Ojo-ron)," written by Seshin (4-5 A.D.).
Meanwhile, the original Sanskrit text of "Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra" has not been discovered, so it is assumed that its broad outline was established in Central Asia around 4-5 A.D. and that factors related to China were added during the process of translation.
However, it had a considerable effect on Jodo-kyo in China and Japan.
In China, Jodo-kyo sutras were transmitted beginning in the latter half of the second century, and Eon (the Eastern Jin) (334-416) of Mt. Rozan founded Byakuren-sha, an association of Nenbutsu, based on "Hanju Zanmai-kyo Sutra" at the beginning of the fifth century.
Soon, considering 'Three Sutras of the Pure Land (Jodosanbu-kyo Sutra)' as the basic sutras,
Doran (476-542), centered at Xuanzhongsi Temple in Shanxi Province, wrote "The Commentary of Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge (The Commentary of Oji-ron),"
Doshaku (562-645) wrote "Anrakushu,"
and Zendo (613-681) wrote "Kammuryojukyosho (Kangyosho),"
so that Jodo-kyo was established with a central focus on Invocation of the Buddha's Name, which was appropriate to the world of Mappo (Age of the Final Dharma) of Gojoku Akuse (五濁悪世).
Later, Enichi (680-748), Hossho (? - around 777) of Goe Nenbutsu (五会念仏) and others enforced the tendency to integrate Jodo-kyo in other groups such as the Zen sect.
In Japan, Jodo-kyo (Jodo-shiso) was transmitted in around the first half of the seventh century, and Ennin (794-864) transmitted the way of nenbutsu-zanmai (nenbutsu samadhi, or mental absorption in the nenbutsu) of Mt. Wutai Shan in China to Mt. Hiei-zan in the first half of the ninth century.
Soon Ryogen (912-985) wrote "Gokurakujodo Kuhon Ojo-gi" and Genshin (942-1017) wrote "Ojoyoshu (Collection on the Essentials for Birth)," and as a result the Tendai Jodo sect became prevalent.
Byohoin Temple was built by FUJIWARA no Yorimichi, based on Jodo-shiso.
Jodo-shiso in the Heian period was believed mainly by the aristocracy of Kyoto, but Kuya (903-972) preached Jodo-kyo to the grass roots as well and was called the "saint of the city."
Ryonin (1072-1132) preached Yuzu Nenbutsu (融通念仏) (Dai Nenbutsu), which said 'one Nenbutsu is integrated in all other people's Nenbutsu,' and became a founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect.
In the other sects (except for the Tendai sect) there also existed Nenbutsu priests such as Eikan (1033-1111) of the Sanron sect and Kakuban (1095- 1143) of the Shingon sect.
From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, by writing "Senchaku Hongan Nenbutsu-shu (Senchaku-shu)" Honen (1133-1212) established Jodo sect and determined the basic sutras by adding "Jodo-ron" of Tenjin to "Three Sutras of the Pure Land," namely "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra" (translated by Sogi Kosogai), "Bussetsu Kan Muryoju-kyo Sutra" (translated by Ryuso Kyoryoyasha) and "Bussetsu Amida-kyo Sutra" (translated by Yoshin Kumaraju) ('Three Sutras and One Theory').
Shinran (1173-1262), a disciple of Honen, wrote "Kenjodoshinjitsukyogyoshomonrui" and others, developed the Jodo sect and later became a founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect.
Ippen (1239-1289) visited many provinces for the sake of missionary work and founded the Jishu sect.
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, Jodo sect, Jodo Shinshu sect and Jishu sect, which began from the latter half of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, developed in a later age and formed extensive lineages in Japanese Buddhism up to the present.
"Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo, Prajñā-pāramitā-hṛdaya in Sanskrit)" is one of the Buddhist sutras that preaches the Ku (Buddhism) of Mahayana Buddhism and Prajna thought.
There are various names depending on the sect, so it is also called Bussetsu Maka Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra, Maka Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra and Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra.
It is abbreviated as "Heart Sutra (心経)."
Additionally, a Chinese title accompanies the word '経 (sutra),' but in the title of Sanskrit text there is no word 'sutra' that corresponds to '経.'
It is said that in the text of less than 300 characters the essence of Mahayana Buddhism is preached, and it has been used as one of the sutras for recitation without regard to whether one is a priest or a lay person (except for certain sects).
"Hannya Shingyo" is generally said to be the essence or a representation of the 600 volumes of "Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra (Daihannyaharamitta-kyo Sutra)," but it consists of the abstract from "the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra" ("Dai-Hannya-kyo Sutra") and "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra"("Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra") with the addition of a litany (Sktdhāranī), which is included in "Darani Jikkyo Sutra" at the end.
While it summarizes the themes of the Prajnaparamita-sutras as 'Ku (Buddhism),' it preaches its importance and glorifies the attainment of enlightenment; moreover, it emphasizes the magical aspect of Buddhism, especially with the litany added at the end.
The 'Heart' of Hannya Shingyo is a translation of 'hṛdaya' in Sanskrit (which means 'heart'), or an important thing, but it also means magic (litany, mantra).
Therefore, while Hannya Shingyo is said to be a Buddhist sutra that preaches the view of Ku, it is also said to be a Buddhist sutra of litany.
Generally speaking, the Prajnaparamita sutras do not include magical words except for what became Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) in the latter stage.
Considering the above, "Hannya Shingyo" is extremely peculiar as one of the Prajnaparamita sutras.
Additionally, there is a theory that since the original title of the Sanskrit text does not include the word "sutra," an invocation text made for litany (soji, 総持) came to be considered as a sutra in China.
Moreover, in "Shuri Shu-kyo Mokuroku" (mostly included in "Shutsu Sanzo Kishu, the Chu sanzang ji ji" edited by Soyu, a priest of Liang (Nanchao)) edited by Doan SHAKU in eastern Jin, the oldest catalog of Buddhist sutra, there are titles of "Maka Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1" and "Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1, alternative version"; thus there is a theory that a magic ritual had been established before Hannya Shingyo was established as a sutra.
Additionally, while in the dainibun-Kudokuhon (第二分功德品) No. 32 of "the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra (Dai-Hannya-kyo Sutra)," 'Hannya Haramita' (a word or an idea itself) is considered to be the great spell (大明呪), in "Hannya Shingyo," the phrase 'Hannya Haramita Shu' is set in to add the litany of Zo-mitsu (Mixed Esoteric Buddhism).
Various theories on the meaning of litany have been proposed by such people as Shoko WATANABE and the philosopher Hajime NAKAMURA, but there is no authorized translation.
Original
It is said that Ryuju in India wrote "Daichidoron," a commentary on the Prajnaparamita-sutras during the second to third centuries, and there is a theory assuming that Hannya Shingo was established around this time.
However, the oldest existing Sanskrit book is the Baiyo-bon edition housed at Horyu-ji Temple, which is said to be a manuscript from the latter part of the eighth century (introduced in 609 according to a legend), and it was written in a later age than the time when Buddhist sutras were translated into Chinese.
Moreover, manuscripts that remain in Tibet and Nepal were also made in a subsequent age and their original forms aren't known, so it is suspected that they might be fake sutras.
Translation into Chinese
According to the documents of a later age, "Maka Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1" was translated by Zhi Qian, who came from Central Asia in the third century, and "Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1, alternative version" was translated by Kumaraju; however, "Shuri Shu-kyo Mokuroku" states that their translators are unknown, so it is doubtful that they were translated by these people.
The former no longer exists, and the latter is regarded as "Maka Hannya Haramitsu Daimyo Jukyo" translated by Raju included in Tripitaka, but since Raju began to translate in 402 it could not have been translated in 385, when Doan SHAKU died.
Additionally, the majority of the text corresponds to the text of "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra" translated by Kumaraju of Tripitaka in the Sung, Yuan and Ming editions, but since So-ban Daizo-kyo Sutra (Tripitaka in the Sung edition) was published in the latter part of the twelfth century it is doubtful that this text was translated by Raju.
It is said that Genjo, who had returned from India in 649, also translated "Hannya Shingyo."
As an idea on the history of sutra translation, Buddhist sutras translated into Chinese before Kumaraju are called 'ancient translations,' those after Kumaraju and before Genjo are called 'old translations' and those after Genjo are called 'new translations' (as per the classification of sutra translations).
However, in the aspect of philology the majority of the text was an abstraction from "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra" of Tripitaka in the Korean edition (in the first part of the thirteenth century) translated by Kumaraju, and was different from the corresponding part of the "Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra" translated by Genjo, so that there is also suspicion about whether it was translated by Genjo, as well as the Buddhist sutra, which was said to be a translation by Raju.
The oldest text that is currently considered to be a translation by Genjo is the text that is added to the end of "Shogyojo" in the Shuo Shogyojo (Ji wang shen jiao xu, Shuji Shogyojo) monument at Hongfusi Temple (Kofukuji Temple), which was built in 672.
However, because it had been a long time since 648 when Taiso (Tang tai zong) gave "Shogyojo," and there is a description in the afterword that 'embroidered by order of the Emperor," there is a theory that this epigraph came to be assessed as a translation by Genjo based on Kumaraju's translation in order to glorify Genjo's great work after his death.
Additionally, in "Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra Yusan," written by Jion Daishi Ki, a disciple of Genjo, there is a description to indicate that theory.
Moreover, although "Hannya Shingyo," which is said to be a translation by Genjo, became the most widespread for reading and invocation, this is unusual considering that the Buddhist sutra translated by Raju had since ancient times been used more often than the Buddhist sutra translated by Genjo.
Additionally, sloppy reading of "the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra" is often performed but the text of the Buddhist sutra itself is rarely read and recited.
Representative widespread texts that have additional punctuation marks are as follows:
Moreover, in both Raju's and Genjo's translations, 'Hannya Haramitsu (Hannya Haramita),' 'Sariputra,' '阿耨多羅三藐三菩提,' 'Bosatsu (菩提薩&22517)' and the last 'shu' were not translated into Chinese and showed transcriptions of Sanskrit without changes.
Moreover, in the text that is said to be a translation by Genjo there are more than 10 differences in words depending on the edition, examples of which are as follows:
空即是色受想行識亦復如是（大正蔵）
空即是色受想行識等亦復如是 (lineage of the Hosso-shu sect such as the Horyu-ji Temple edition)
In Japan various sects, especially the Hosso-shu, Tendai, Shingon and Zen sects, use Hannya Shingyo and interpret it individually.
However, the Jodo Shinshu sect regards "Three Sutras of the Pure Land (Jodosanbu-kyo Sutra)" as the fundamental Buddhist sutra, and the Nichiren and Hokke sects regard "Myohorenge-kyo" as that, so they don't recite the Hannya Shingyo.
This is because they don't need to use it from the viewpoint of their dharma, not because they deny the Heart Sutra.
For example, Kozui OTANI, who was a chief priest of the Jodo Shinshu sect at Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple, wrote a commentary on the Hannya Shingyo.
The Tendai sect values it highly as a 'fundamental Hokke (根本法華).'
Moreover, there is a commentary that is said to have been written by Saicho.
In the Shingon sect it is read and recited, and is a subject of 観誦.
It uses it as one of the Buddhist sutra for daily use (see the article of Hannyashin-gyo Hiken).
In the case where one reads and recites it repeatedly, traditionally he starts reading from 'Bussetsu' in the beginning for the first time but begins reading from 'Maka' for the second time without reading 'Bussetsu.'
Because Kukai, the founder of the sect, emphasized Hannya Shingyo, various priests of this sect have written commentaries.
Among those, the works by Kakusho TAKAGAMI, Yuko MIYASAKA and others in the postwar period of Japan are well known.
"Lecture on Hannya Shingyo" by TAKAGAMI, which was broadcasted via NHK radio in the prewar days, was very popular at that time.
It is considered very highly among the commentaries written in modern Japanese, and it receives high praise from scholars and priests of other sects.
In the Jodo Shu sect it is recited at mealtime and so on.
In the Jishu sect it is necessary to recite it three times in front of the shelf of gods that enshrines the soul of Kumano Taisha Shrine after worship of the shrine and morning devotions.
It is also used daily in some cases.
The Rinzai sect regards it as one of the daily Buddhist sutras.
Additionally, Ikkyu, Bankei and Hakuin have made interpretations.
It is often asserted that Hannya Shingyo is a Buddhist sutra that reveals the primary figure of one's heart.
The Soto sect regards it as one of the daily Buddhist sutras.
While the founder Dogen interpreted it, Tenkei's interpretation 'Kanjizai Bosatsu is yourself' is famous.
In addition, many priests such as Ryokan and Santoka TANEDA have tried to implement Hannya Shingyo.
Ryokan left numerous manuscripts of the Hannya Shingyo, and TANEDA made haiku from the Hannya Shingyo.
In the Shugen-do mountaineering ascetic, practitioners (such as itinerant Buddhist monks) recite it when they practice.
In the Shinto religion, some sects recite it.
When it is read and recited in the shrine (in front of the gods), it is read from 'Maka' without reading 'Bussetsu' at the beginning.
For ordinary people it is regarded as a Buddhist sutra of 'miracle-working mantra' instead of a Buddhist sutra that preaches 'Ku,' and some people interpret that it 'erases (空ずる)' the power of evil spirits.
There is an old belief that Hannya Shingyo benefits the recovery from illness, which is seen in "Nihon Ryoiki."
Many people carried it as a charm or hand-copied it in order to pray for recovery from illness.
Additionally, it was recited at shrines.
It is well known that Hokiichi HANIWA read Hannya Shingyo at Kameido Temmangu Shrine and prayed for the success of "Gunsho Ruiju."
During the Edo period, E-shin-gyo (Heart Sutra in Picture Version), was produced for illiterates.
According to "Hannyashin-gyo no Nazo," written by Meiji MOMOSE, this was created by Genemon YAWATA in Ninohe-gun, Iwate Prefecture from 1688 to 1703 for the sake of illiterates and became popular in various provinces through essays, and even literate people enjoyed it as a kind of rebus.
It is often hand-copied concurrently with the practice of manuscripts.
It is also printed on towels and is very common.
Although numerous commentaries have been published, some of them make the mistake of interpreting the original intension of Hannya Shingyo, so that Buddhist scholars sound the alarm.
As the major translation and commentary in modern times, a book of Iwanami-bunko, a translation from the original Sanskrit by Hajime NAKAMURA and Kazuyoshi KINO, "Lecture on Hannya Shingyo," written by Kakusho TAKAGAMI and "Hannyashin-gyo Nyumon," written by Taido MATSUBARA, which interprets from the viewpoint of a priest of the Rinzai sect, have been published and reprinted many times so that their paperback editions are easily obtainable.
Moreover, Jun MIURA proposed outdoor Hannya Shingyo, which is near to pleasure.
Monju Bosatsu, or maJjuzrii in Sanskrit, is one of the Bosatsus which is worshiped in Mahayana Buddhism.
It is said to be a Buddha that controls wisdom.
Monju is an abbreviated name for Monjushuri.
Additionally, it is called Myo Kissho Bosatsu.
Moreover, it is shown in transcript as Manjushiri and is translated as Myokichijo, Myotoku (Myodoku, 妙徳) or Myoshu (妙首).
It is also written as 文珠菩薩.
The Sanmayagyo symbols are the shorenge (a blue tropical water lily), sharp sword and bonkyo (sutras written on coconut leaves).
Shusi (Shuji, Bija) (Mikkyo) is maM.
According to "Monjushuri Nehan-kyo Sutra," it was born in a Brahmin family called Brahmadatta at Tara Juraku, in Sravasti.
Another theory says it was familiar with Shaka's 10 disciples and was related to the editing of Buddhist sutras.
"Yuima-kyo Sutra" described that when nobody could argue with Yuima-koji, who was sick in bed, only Monju Bosatsu, who visited him in place of Shaka, exchanged questions and answers evenly, and this episode highlighted its character as the Bosatsu of wisdom.
Based on this theory, pictures or statues showing the scene in which Monju Bosatsu visited Yuima-koji were produced.
Later, Monju Bosatsu was not seen as a realistic figure as described in "Yuima-kyo Sutra" but gradually became deified through later sutras.
It is said that although it is of the Bosatsu grade in order to benefit Shaka's teaching, once it became Buddha it was called Ryushu-nyorai, Daishin-butsu or Shinsen-butsu and will become Buddha (called Fuken-nyorai) in the future.
In another theory, it exists in the joyful world (常喜世界) in the north at present and is called 歓喜蔵摩尼宝積如来, the name of which can diminish crimes of 四重禁等, or it is said that it lives at Qingliangshan (Wutai Shan Mountain) in Shanxi Province China with 10,000 Bosatsu.
Additionally, according to "Hokkekyo Sutra," after Nichigatsu Tomyo-butsu entered nirvana in the past life, its disciple Myoko Bosatsu was reborn as Monju Bosatsu.
However, these are based on descriptions in Mahayana Sutra; there is no evidence that Monju Bosatsu really existed.
As opposed to Kanzeon Bosatsu and others, it is thought that a real model person existed and that it was the Bosatsu who was created in Buddhist organizations.
Monju Bosatsu is seen in the early Mahayana Sutra, especially in the Prajnaparamita-sutras.
This sutra describes 'Ku (空)' of Hannya in place of Shaka-muni Buddha.
Additionally, many sutras praise Monju Bosatsu as 'Buddha's mother in the three periods,' and in "Kegon-kyo Sutra" it plays an important role to take out Zenzai-doshi on the path to seek Buddhism.
These sutras show that the moral nature of Monju Bosatsu is Hannya (wisdom), which is an important factor in attaining enlightenment.
Moreover, developed from the original aspect of the wisdom to reach enlightenment, it became a symbol of wisdom in general (being smart and having much knowledge), which led to the proverb 'Two heads are better than one' in a later age.
Additionally, in "Feng-Shen-Yen-I," a light novel of China, there appeared mountain hermitscalled Fugen Shinjin and Monju Koho Tenson, who believed Buddhism later and became Fugen Bosatsu and Monju Bosatsu respectively, but this is fiction of a later age.
In China, Mt. Wutai Shan in Shanxi Province has been worshipped widely since ancient times as Qingliangshan, where Monju Bosatsu lives, and this was introduced by Ennin in Japan.
Moreover, in Vol. 29 of "Bussotoki," which is a text of the Chinese Tendai sect, there is the description, 'Monju lives in Zhongnan Shan now and it is a priest Tojun,' which means that Tojun, a founder of the Chinese Kegon sect, was regarded as a reincarnation of Monju Bosatsu.
It is regarded as the principle image of Jianzhou Jurchen (建州女真族) and was identified as Manchuria (Manchus), named after Monju Bosatsu.
After Hung Taiji, Jianzhou Jurchen arrived at the name Manchus instead of Jurchen.
Therefore, the origin of the word Manchuria is assumed to be Monju.
In Japan there is a legend that Gyoki, a priest in the Nara period, was a reincarnation of Monju Bosatsu.
It is one of the kyoji (attendant figures) of Shakanyorai with Fugen Bosatsu (see "Shaka Triad") and is broadly worshiped by itself.
The shapes of Monju Bosatsu statues are nearly identical.
It is in the lotus position on a lion's back with a sharp sword (treasure sword) to symbolize wisdom in the right hand and a shorenge bearing the sutra in the left hand.
In Mikkyo it is shaped as a child with its hair tied in a bun (髻), which conveys a pure mind.
The number of buns can be one, five, six or eight, depending on the statue, and a statue that has one bun is regarded as a principle image in ascetic training for the increase of benefit; the one with five is for adoration, the one with six is for Chobuku (conquest, 調伏) and the one with eight is for safety.
Additionally, the 'Monju quintet' Monju gosonzo was produced, consisting of Monju riding a lion, Zenzai-doshi as an usher, Udenno drawing the reins of the lion, Buddhapali, and the elder Saisho Ronin.
In the Zen sect it is placed as 'Shoso,' which shows the complete figure of an ascetic monk in the monk hall (僧堂) and is shaped as a figure with hair cut engaged in the practice of seated meditation.
In this case, from the viewpoint that Monju is also on the way of ascetic training, it is sometimes called Monji Daishi, which avoids using the title of Bosatsu.
Major works in Japan are the seated statue at Kofuku-ji Temple Tokondo (Eastern Golden Hall) (made by Jokei, a national treasure), Gosonzo at Abe Monju-in Temple (made by Kaikei, an important cultural property) and Gosonzo at Chikurin-ji Temple in Kochi city (an important cultural property).
On Arahasyanou
Taishakuten is one of the Tenbu, deities of Buddhism who reside in a heavenly realm, this being one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another.
It is the war god of Brahmin, Hindu and Zoroastrianism and the same god as Indra that is seen in the clauses of Hittite.
It is also called Shaku Daikanin.
Shaku is Azana, and Daikanin means "most high."
It is often shown as a pair of statues with Bonten (Brahma), a major Hindu deity thought to be responsible for creating the world.
It is the husband of Sachi, a daughter of Ashura.
The name of Taishakuten (帝釈天) originated from Indra's name, Sakro Devanam Indrah, as follows: Sakuro is transliterated to 釈, Devanam is translated freely to 天, and Indrah is translated freely to 帝 and placed first.
Originally, Indra was a war god that fought with Ashura, but it became one of the two good major deities of Buddhism with Bonten after it was incorporated to Buddhism, and it was considered to have helped Shaka before gaining enlightenment and hearing its preaching (see the article on Indra).
It is said that it has some followers such as the Shitenno (four guardian kings) and lives at Zenken-jo Castle atop Mt. Shumisen (the Touriten).
There are Buddhist pictures of Indra, in which Taishakuten, who follows Shaka, has been drawn.
In Vol. 33 of Nehan-kyo Sutra (The Sutra of the Great Nirvana) and Vol. 56 of Daichidoron, there is a description that Taishakuten was called Kyoshika （Kauśika）when he was a human.
In ancient times, in Mahadh there was a Brahmin whose first name was Maka and family name was Kyoshika, and who did good deeds (福徳) and had great wisdom.
He had 32 acquaintances and friends with whom to learn and do good deeds, and after death he was reborn in the second world above on the top of Mt. Shumisen.
Maka Brahmin became most high, and 32 acquaintances and friends became ministers to give advice so that 33 (including him) are called the 33 Ten.
For this reason Shaka Buddha calls him Kyoshika, his true name.
Moreover, his wife Sachi is in some cases called Mrs. Kyoshika.
In Japan it is often expressed as a statue with two upper arms (二臂像), its hair tied in a treasure bun (宝髻) atop the head, and dressed in Chinese formal clothes.
In some cases he wears armor under the clothes and has a kongosho or a lotus root in his hand.
In Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) there are some examples in which he has one face and two upper arms (一面二臂) with a crown on the head, armor on the body and a tokkosho, a pestle with a single sharp blade at each end--this being considered an attribute of Buddhist guardian figures as well as a symbolic item of Esoteric Buddhism--in his hand.
The other figure depicts him riding a white elephant.
The oldest work in Japan is seen in 'the picture of Seshin Monge, giving up the body to hear a verse of scripture,' drawn on Tamamushi no zushi, the Beetle Wing Shrine, (Asuka period) at Horyu-ji Temple.
At Jiki-do in Horyu-ji Temple were placed statues of Bonten and Taishakuten (Nara period) (currently placed at Dai-Hozo-In (Great Treasure Gallery).
At Hoke-do (Sangatsudo) in Todai-ji Temple there are statues of Bonten and Taishakuten of kanshitsu-zukuri, done in the dry lacquer technique (Nara period).
At Toshodai-ji Temple Kondo there are wooden statues of Bonten and Taishakuten (Nara period).
At the Toji Lecture Hall, in Kyoto, there is a wooden statue on a white elephant, which is characteristic of Mikkyo.（first stage of the Heian period)
In Japan, Ennichi (Hoping) is held on Koshin Day.
For an example of the temple where Taishakuten is enshrined, Shibamata Taishakuten (Daikyo-ji Temple) in Tokyo's Katsushika Ward, has been made famous by the movie "Otoko Wa Tsurai Yo (It's Tough Being a Man)."
Since the lost Ita-honzon (wooden main deity) of Taishakuten was discovered during the restoration of the main hall of Daikyo-ji Temple one Koshin Day in the latter half of the eighteenth century, Ennichi became to be held on Koshin Day (for details, see "Shibamata Taishakuten").
In the Dankun myth, which originated in the Goryeo period of Korea, Dankun, a founder of Dankun (Korea) is regarded as a son who was born from Kanyu, a bastard child of Taishakuten (Kanin in 'Sangokuiji'), and a woman that had humanized from a female bear.
Yakushi Nyorai, bhaiSajya-guru in Sanskrit, is a Nyorai of Mahayana Buddhism.
It is also called Yakushi Ｒuriko Ｎyorai or Daiiobutsu.
Its Sanma yagyo (characteristic of the Buddha) is a medicine vase or a bowl containing pills.
Its shuji (characteristic one syllable word) (Esoteric Buddhism) (shuji) is bhai, the initials of its name.
Representative Buddhist scriptures that preach 'Yakushi Nyorai are Yakushi ruriko nyorai hongan kudokukyo (Yakushikyo),' which was translated by Genjo, and 'Yakushi ruriko shichibutsu hongan kudokukyo (Shichibutsu yakushikyo),' which was translated by Gijo.
According to Yakushi hongan kudokukyo, Yakushi Nyorai was a founder of a religious sect in Toho joruri sekai (Eastern Pure Land), and swore 12 oaths when it was Bodhisattva, lengthened people's lives by curing their diseases, removed disasters, provided clothes and food, practiced Buddhist ascetic training and finally became Buddha by attaining Mujo bodai (perfect Buddhist enlightenment).
Yakushi Nyorai is believed to cure people's diseases by Ruriko (lazuline light).
Unlike other Nyorai, it is the target of worship seeking worldly interests since it is the buddha of medicine which provides medicine to cure avidya disease.
It is a Nyorai of exoteric Buddhism and the Japanese Shingon Sect (Shingon Esoteric Buddhism) basically does not emphasize it.
Although it is often treated as chuson (the center statue of three or more statues) in Besson mandara (Mandara of individual deities) of Zo-mitsu (the Mixed Esoteric Buddhism), it doesn't appear in Ryokai mandara (Mandara of the two Realms) of Jun-mitsu (The Pure Esoteric Buddhism).
However, in the Tendai Sect (Tendai Esoteric Buddhism) which traditionally had close ties with the Emperor's family, it was sometimes linked with the Emperor, a king of the eastern country, because it was the founder of a religious sect in Toho joruri sekai.
Being an eastern Nyorai, he is also regarded as the same Nyorai as Ashuku Nyorai.
Further, there exist views that assert it is the same Nyorai as Dainichi Nyorai and such views derive from the interpretation by Tendai Esoteric Buddhism that Shaka Nyorai of Kuon-jitsujo, advocated in Lotus Sutra of exoteric Buddhism, coincides with Dainichi Nyorai of Esoteric Buddhism or Shaka Nyorai appears in the shape of Dainichi Nyorai in order to save people.
As for the statue form, there exist both standing statues and seated statues and normally, their right hands make semui in (mudra for bestowing fearlessness), while the left hands make yogan in (wish-granting mudra) and hold a medicine vase.
However, many statues produced in ancient Japan, such as the statue in the main hall of the Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara and the statue in the main hall of the Toshodai-ji Temple in Nara, don't hold a medicine vase.
It is believed that the production of statues holding a medicine vase started after the introduction of 'Yakushi Nyorai nenju giki' translated by Fuku.
Yakushi Nyorai is enshrined not only as a single statue but also as Yakushi Sanzonzo (three statues) with Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu situated on both sides.
The statue of Juni Jinsho (the twelve divine generals) is often enshrined together as the followers of Yakushi Nyorai.
In the halo of Yakushi Nyorai, 6 or 7 statues of the same size are situated.
They are called Shichibutsu Yakushi (to be mentioned afterward) and believed to be Yakushi Nyorai and its avatars.
Temple festival of Yakushi Nyorai is held on the 8th of each month.
The above practice is believed to have derived from 'Yakushiko' (religious meeting of worshipping Yakushi Nyorai) at which people learnt and praised the virtue of Yakushi Nyorai.
Most Kokubun-ji Temples enshrine Yakushi Nyorai as their principal image.
In 'Yakushi ruriko shichibutsu hongan kudokukyo (Shichibutsu Yakushikyo)' translated by Gijo and 'Yakushi Nyorai hongankyo' translated by Daruma Gyuta, original vows and bukkokudo (the land that Buddha has purified) of Shichibutsu, including Yakushi Nyorai, are advocated.
Tendai Esoteric Buddhism emphasized Shichibutsu Yakushi ho (praying to the seven Yakushi Nyorai), which was believed to have originated by Ennin, as the one which brings about health and safe delivery, and prayer for safe delivery using Shichibutsu Yakushi ho was conducted at the Fujiwara sekkanke (the families which produced regents) in the 8th -9th century.

In Japan where a creed seeking worldly interests was prevalent among people, Yakushi Nyorai scriptures were often produced for the purpose of praying for the healing of diseases.
Along with Amida Nyorai which promises peaceful death, Yakushi Nyorai attracted the most worshippers in Japan.
Although the year of 607 is seen in the halo of the seated statue of Yakushi Nyorai enshrined at the main hall of the Horyu-ji Temple in Nara, it is said, judging from the terms used in its inscription and casting technology employed in the production of the statue, that it was actually produced in the late 7th century.
Further, as it is the rare Nyorai that presides over worldly interests, many typical (in charge of praying to defend and maintain the nation) Esoteric Buddhism temples, such as Enryaku-ji Temple, Jingo-ji Temple, To-ji Temple and Kanei-ji Temple, enshrine Yakushi Nyorai as their principal image.
(As there are a lot of statues, only those that are famous from the viewpoint of Buddhist sculpture history and those designated as national treasure are listed.)
The statue at the Shojo-ji Temple in Fukushima (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Ninna-ji Temple (the former Kita-in) in Kyoto (a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Jingo-ji Temple in Kyoto (a standing statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at Yakushido of the Daigo-ji Temple (Kami Daigo) in Kyoto (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Shishikutsu-ji Temple in Osaka (a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the main hall of the Horyu-ji Temple in Nara (a seated statue, from the Asuka period to the Nara period, a national treasure)
The statue at the lecture hall of the Horyu-ji Temple in Nara (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the middle of the Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the main hall of the Toshodai-ji Temple in Nara (a standing statue, from the Nara period to the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the Nara period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Shin Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (seated statue, early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at Nara National Museum (seated statue, early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Ganko-ji Temple in Nara (Shibanoshinya-cho, Nara City) (standing statue, early Heian period, a national treasure)
In the Tokugawa period, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, the first Shogun, was deified and was called shinkun.
Thanks to the work of Buddhist monk Tenkai, Ieyasu was given the posthumous name of 'Tosho Daigongen' by the imperial court and was enshrined at the Toshogu Shrine.
This is the origin of the faith in Tosho Gongen.
This faith is the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism and according to it, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA is assumed as the temporary figure of Yakushi Nyorai who appeared in Japan while religious service is conducted in the way of Jinja Shinto.
As Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was believed to have been born after his mother, Odai no kata, prayed to Yakushi Nyorai enshrined at the Horai-ji Temple (Shinshiro City, Aichi Prefecture) as its principal image, it is also said that Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was the reincarnation of Yakushi Nyorai, a principal image of the Horai-ji Temple, who appeared in the human world.
As for the mantra of Yakushi Nyorai, its shoshu is 'on korokoro sendari matougi sowaka' and it coincides with that of Muno Shomyoo.
Its taishu is 'noumo bagyabatei baiseija kuro beiruria haraba arajaya tatagyataya arakatei sanmyakusanbodaya taniyata on baiseizei baiseizei sanborigyatei sowaka' and it appears in Yakusi hongan kudokukyo.
Yakushi Nyorai's shoshu has the meaning which reflects primitive Indian or Asian customs.
The translation of this shoshu is 'omu (sacred voice), remove, Candari, Matangi, achieve (subaha)'.
Remove' means removing plague and Candari and Matangi are the female names of a clan that was engaged in slaughter work, but originally they were the names of goddesses that were worshipped by people of lower class.
Original meaning of 'subaha' is an offering to be thrown into the festival fire.
Later, it was deified as the wife of Agni, the god of fire, and became a yell to be used when praying for the achievement of hope while making an offering.
Upper class people despised Candari and Matangi or regarded them as dangerous as the goddesses that were worshipped by dirty people.
However, it was generally believed that people were able to escape from plagues presided by such a goddess by daring to pray to them.
In terms of the concept of escaping from plague by chanting mantra to aragami which causes such plague, it has a similar nature with 'Somin shorai' in Japan.
Juni Shinsho (the 12 protective deities) are tenbu, deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another; they are worshiped and shaped into statues in Buddhism, and are good deities that guard Buddhism.
They are also called Juni Yashataisho or Juni Shinmyoo and comprise 12 war gods who guard people who believe in the Yakushi-nyorai and Yakushi-kyo sutra.
It is said that the Juni Shinsho guard each 12 hours of the day and night in accordance with the 12 wishes of Yakushi-nyorai.
For this reason the zodiac is applied.
Each protective deity heads each of 7,000 attendants, covering a total of 84,000 Yasha, i.e., a class of semi-divine being usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified together with malignant spirits.
Above their heads are often placed signs modeled after the animals of the zodiac.
In Japan the life-size statue of Juni Shinsho at Shin-Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara is the oldest, and it is famous for its excellence of form.
Additionally, the Juni Shinsho have each principal image of Buddha such as Buddha, Bosatsu and Myoo.
Each name and its corresponding principal image of Buddha and the zodiac follows (although there are a few differences in the letters and sounds, depending on the sutras, but the following names are commonly used).
Although the 12 deities' belongings and poses are not necessarily unified, it is nearly impossible to distinguish them only by characters depicted in pictures and statues.
In China the statue of Juni Shinsho had been produced in early times, and there is an example of wall painting in Dunhuang City.
In China they have been worshiped in association with the zodiac, and many works in Japan also depict animals of the zodiac above their heads.
In Japan many statues such as the statue of Shin-Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (eighth century) in the Nara period have been produced.
In many cases, at the Buddhist halls where Yakushi-nyorai is placed as the principle image of Buddha, each of six deities is placed on the left and right side of Yakushi-nyorai, or in a line ahead of the Buddhist altar.
There are various ways of expression; in one case they are placed around a circular Buddhist altar such as the statues of Shin-Yakushi-ji Temple, and in another case they form a halo or a foundation of the statue of Yakushi-nyorai.
They are shown as war gods, the same as the statues of the Shitenno (four guardian kings), and in many works each of twelve characters is distinguished by its facial expression or pose, and they vary widely as a group.

Additionally, as opposed to the above Buddhist scriptures, Juni Tensho, which is used in Rikujinshinka, one of the mantic or shikisen in Onmyo-do, is sometimes incorrectly called Juni Shinsyo.
In 'Junisho Shoshuhodaiyon,' the fourth chapter of Senjiryakketsu, written by ABE no Seimei, a famous master of Onmyo-do, things that Juni Tensyo reveal are explained as follows:

Bishamonten (vaizravaNa in Sanskrit) is a Buddha of the Tenbu, deities who reside in a heavenly realm, this being one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another, in Buddhism.
It is a war god and one of the Shitenno (four guardian kings) with Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra), Zochoten (Virudhaka) and Komokuten (Virupaksa).
Additionally, it is not only one of the shitenno but is worshiped individually over a broad region, such as Central Asia and China (other than in Japan).
Its predecessor is Kubera, a treasure god in Indian myth.
The title of vaizravaNa originally meant 'the son of vizravas,' so it originated from his father's name, but it can be interpreted as 'a man who listens very well' so that it is also translated as Tamonten.
In Japan, when it is shaped as a statue and placed as one of the Shitenno it is usually called 'Tamonten,' but when in the form of a statue and placed individually it is usually called 'Bishamonten.'
The Sanmayagyo symbol is a treasure club (a club with which to defeat the enemy of Buddhism in order to protect the Buddhist dharma) as well as a pagoda.
Shushi (Shuji, Bija) in Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) is vai.
The mantra (shingon) for Bishamonten is 'On Beishiramanayasowaka (oM vaizravaNaaya svaahaa, that is, om (saintly sound), the son of vizravas, svaahaa), etc.
Although there are various figures (as below), in Japan it is generally expressed as a warrior figure of the Tang dynasty that dons leather armor.
Its belongings generally consist of a pagoda.
Moreover, it often stands on an ogre called Jaki (邪鬼).
For example, in the Ryokai Mandala (Mandala of the Two Realms) of Mikkyo, it is drawn as a figure that has a treasure club in the right hand and a pagoda in the left hand and is wearing armor.
However, the Shitenno statue in Todai-ji Temple Kaidan-do is shaped as a figure that has a pagoda in the right hand and a treasure club in the left hand.
(The statue in Nara Taima-dera Temple has a pagoda in the right hand as well.)
In India, it was considered as a treasure god and was hardly depicted as a warrior.
As to the character in this age, see the article on Kubera.
During the process that was transmitted to China through Central Asia, the faith as a war god was created and it came to be a guardian deity as one of the Shitenno.
Additionally, as a following of Taishakuten it is said to live in Tengyo-jo Castle of Suishota, which is the north of Mt. Shumisen (Mt. Sumeru) or to guard Hokkurushu (uttara-kuru), one of the four continents in the world view of ancient India.
Moreover, it subordinates devils such as Yasha (a class of semi-divinity that is usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but is sometimes also classified with malignant spirits) and Rasetsu (Rakshasa).
Additionally, in Mikkyo it is one of the juniten (十二天) and is said to guard the north.
In Japan it is one of the seven deities of good luck as a unique faith and is revered because it seems to benefit games especially.
Figure of image
There is no clear rule regarding Bisyamonten's figure, so that various expressions exist.
It is expressed as the figure of a warrior in Japan as mentioned above, and generally it has a pagoda.
There is another work that has a trident: for example, the statue at Mimuroto-ji Temple in Kyoto does not have a pagoda but a trident in one hand and places the other hand on his hip.
In the folk faith of China it is expressed as a figure that has a green face with an umbrella in the right hand and a silver mouse in the left hand.
In Tibetan Buddhism it is expressed as a figure that has a mongoose who disgorges gold, silver and jewels, thus maintaining the character of a treasure god in India.
There are many works as an individual deity or the central deity.
The styles of placement are as follows: a triad style in which Bishamonten is placed at the center with Kyoji (attendant figures) of Kisshoten (Kichijoten, Sri-mahadevi, who is said to a wife of the sister of Bishamonten) and Zennishi-doji (who is said to be a son of Bishamonten) (Kurama Temple in Kyoto, Sekkei-ji Temple in Kochi, and so on); a style that places a pair of Bishamonten with Kisshoten (the statue of Horyuji Temple Kondo (法隆寺金堂) in Nara); and a style that places a pair of Bishamonten with Fudo Myoo (the statue of Koyasan Kongobuji Temple and so on).
Additionally, in the temples of the Tendai sect it is often seen that Senju Kannon is placed at the center and Bishamonten and Fudo Myoo are placed at its sides (Myoo-in Temple in Shiga, Bujo-ji Temple in Kyoto).
There are many works of Tamonten statues that guard the north (the back of the dais for a Buddhist image on the observer's right) as being among the Shitenno.
The figure is nearly the same as an individual Bishamonten statue but often has a pagoda in one hand.
Designated works from the nation are Tamonten statues among the Shitenno statues at Todai-ji Temple Kaidan-do, Joruri-ji Temple in Kyoto, Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara.
Derived figures
Takutori-tenno
In China it was mixed with Risei (Li Jing), a warrior at the beginning of the Tang who was respected as a war god, which led to the creation of the god Takutori-tenno.
This Takutori-tenno is today thought of as a god other than Tamonten among the Shitenno and as a kind of shogun of gods who led the Shitenno, including Tamonten.
Later, it became to be revered in Dokyo as well.
This is Takutori-tenno, described as father of Nata-taishi in "Journey to West" and Risei in Feng-Shen-Yen-I.
As mentioned above, while Tamonten of the Shitenno is shown as a figure that has an umbrella, Takutori-tenno is shown as a warrior figure that has a pagoda.
This succeeds the old figure of Bishamonten, which was shaped during the Tang dynasty.
Tobatsu Bishamonten
There is a particular figure of statue which is called Tobatsu Bishamonten.
It wears armor knitted from chains (Kinsako (金鎖甲), and protective gear called Ebigote (海老籠手) over the arms, as well as a coronet on the head.
Its belongings are a pagoda in the left hand and a treasure club or ji in the right hand, which is clearly exotic.
Additionally, it stands on Chitennyo and two devils (Niranba and Biranba) instead of Jaki.
It is said that Tobatsu Bishamonten in To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple) was placed on Rajomon gate.
It is generally said that 'Tobatsu (兜跋)' means Western 兜跋 country (Turfan at present), which is based on a legend that Bishamonten appeared in this place with this figure.
Other characters of '刀抜' or '屠半' are used in some cases.
The figures of statues are clarified into two: the one that faithfully emulates the statue of To-ji Temple (the statue of Nara National Museum, the statue of Seiryo-ji Temple in Kyoto) and the other, which is nearly the same as the usual Bishamonten statue except that it stands on both hands of Chitennyo (Narushima Bishamon-do in Iwate, etc.).
"Monzeki" or "Monseki" means the formal successor of the founder of a Buddhist sect in Japan.
It means 'Monyo Monryu.'
It is also called Monshu.
Since the Kamakura period it has come to mean the high-class temple itself, or in other words the status of the temple, and those temples have come to be called Monzeki temples.
It was in the beginning that Emperor Uda became priest and lived in Ninna-ji Temple (therefore called Omuro-gosho), and came to be called Omuro-Monzeki.
Since around the beginning of the Kamakura period, children of the Imperial Family and the sekke (the line of regents and advisers) came to be priests at specific temples.
The children had a Shoen (i.e. a manor) and came to take control of accepted temples by political power due to their economic power so that they ultimately came to succeed each monryu.
This became a custom, and soon 'Monzeki' itself was changed to mean the title of the specific temples to which people from the 'nobility' succeeded.
During the Muromachi period, 'Monzeki,' as the status of a temple, was established so that the post of Monzeki bugyo (shogunate administrator, 門跡奉行) to govern Monzeki temples was assigned by the Muromachi shogunate.
Additionally, the Edo shogunate institutionalized the monzeki through the clarification of miya-monzeki (temples headed by imperial princes, 宮門跡), sekke-monzeki (temples headed by the sekke families, 摂家門跡), seiga-monzeki (temples headed by the seiga families, 清華門跡), kubo-monzeki (公方門跡) or buke-monzki (武家門跡, temples headed by military families), jun-monzeki (准門跡) or waki-monzeki (脇門跡), etc.

They are also called the thirteen monzeki.
In fact, only the Imperial Prince could enter the three monzeki of Rinno-ji Temple, Ninna-ko Temple and Daikaku-ji Temple, while children from the sekke could enter the other monzeki.
This word has been used since around the Muromachi period, and children from the sekke became chief priests.
It was not an inherent title of each monzeki temple but instead indicated the descent of the chief priest.
Temples of a status second to Monzeki
Or, a monzeki temple that is subordinate to the other one
It is also called "Waki Monzeki."

The sect Hong gwan-ji-ha is one of the Jodo Shinshu sects.
The head temple is Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple, which began from Otani Byodo (the present Otani Mausoleum), a grave of Shinran, the founder of the sect.
The branch temples number 10,497.
The believers number approximately 6,940,000, which is the largest among Jodo Shinshu sects (Shinshu sects) and among Buddhist religious corporations as well.
Among religious corporations as a whole, it is the second largest after Jinja-Honcho, the Association of Shinto Shrines.
(As of December 31, 2000)
At the beginning of the Meiji period, it had a governmental system of legislative process (shukai) and administration (shumusho), thus emulating the system of separation of the powers in Western countries.
This became a model for the Meiji government in establishing a legislative system.
The twenty-second Kozui OTANI, a monshu (Honganji-ha head priest) who had great power, made efforts to send an Otani exploration party to engage in missionary work abroad and educate students, but the cost brought Hongwan-ji Temple's finances to the point of crisis, so Kyonyo was forced to retire.
In order to avoid another crisis, Hongwan-ji-ha deemed it necessary to limit the power of the monshu (the Otani family).
The Otani family changed its status from the center of power to a symbol.
Monshu is the chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple and a person who 'succeeds the light of Buddhism integrates this sect and directs duties (宗務)' (Article 6 of the sect law), and the representative of religious cooperation is Shumu-socho, who is elected at the shukai (representative assembly) (among Shinshu sects, but only Hongwan-ji-ha calls it socho).
It was in 1877 when the name of the sect was formally established as the Jodo Shinshu sect Hongwan-ji-ha.
It is called 'Onishi-san' in order to distinguish it from the Shinshu sect Otani-ha ('Ohigashi-san').
The head temple, Hongwan-ji Temple, is also called 'Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple' generally or is called 'Hompa Hongwan-ji Temple' in the sense of Hongwan-ji-ha.
The Shinshu sect Otani-ha is one of the groups of Jodo Shinshu sect.
The head temple is Higashi-Hongwan-ji Temple, at Rokujo Karasuma in Kyoto.
The number of branch temples is 9,804.
In order to distinguish it from the Jodo Shinshu sect Hongwan-ji-ha (commonly called 'Onishi-san,' 'Hompa' or 'Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple'), it is called 'Ohigashi-san,' 'O-ha' 'Tani-ha' and so on.
Shin-shu Honbyo, the head temple, is commonly called 'Higashi-Hongwan-ji Temple' after the split of the east and west for the same reason.
This summary extracts and cites the "Religious Corporation 'Shinshu Sect Otani-ha' Rules," which are made public based on the Religious Corporation Act, and the "Shinshu Sect Otani-ha Shuken (Constitution of Sect, 宗憲) ("Shuken" in the following), which is defined as the supreme rule in its Article 3.
The core principles of sect management are as follows:
(Source: the preceding sentence on Shuken)
Continuous practice of the Doho society (同朋社会)
All people who believe in the sect make efforts to review the teachings of the Jodo Shinshu sect, by each person constantly, and confirm it with others, and continuously practice the social life toward attainment of the Buddhist paradise of Amitabha Buddha.
Combination of the sect and the mausoleum
The Shin-shu Honbyo (mausoleum) in which a picture of the sect's founder Shinran is placed, is an important place for all followers of the sect to confirm the teachings on which they depend, so that all followers of the sect have to revere and guard this, being combined equally with the doctrine.
Open discussion by Doho
The management of the sect is based on open discussions by all Doho (followers) without permitting anyone's tyranny.
Shuken' is the supreme law of Otani-ha.
(Source: Chapter 1, Article 5 of Shuken)
The main doctrine is Ogen Ni-eko (Oso-eko・Genso-eko), as constituted from the name of Hongwan (by Amidanyorai), which was extracted from Kenjodoshinjitsukyogyoshomonrui (Kyogyoshinsho) based on Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra by the founder of the sect, St. Shinran.

Moreover, in order to express gratitude for the prevalence of the true dharma (正法), the pictures of Shinran, the founder of the sect, Prince Shotoku, seven high priests and successive monshus (Hongwan-ji-ha head priests) are placed.

Following the above basic principles, various types of missionary work, social activities and projects are implemented.
Actual management is currently implemented by the central and local organizations (30 parishes in Japan and three parishes abroad (開教区), with 420 groups (So (組)) in those parishes).
In each organization a system for the separation of the powers is adopted as follows:
Central organization
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): Shukai (bicameral legislature of Shu-gikai (representative of priests elected from each parish, 宗議会) and San-gikai (representative of lay followers elected from each parish, 参議会))
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): executive bodies to implement religious activities such as Naikyoku (内局) (consisting of Shumu-socho, who is appointed at Shukai and is a representative director of the Religious Corporation Shinshu sect Otani-ha, and five sanmus (参務) appointed from Shumu-socho), Shumusyo (in the center), Kyomusho (a local branch in each parish, 教務所), and Kaikyo Kantokubu (a branch in each overseas parish, 開教監督部)
The organization that corresponds to judicial branch (a body for investigation): Shinmonin (審問院) (headed by Shinmonincho, who is appointed by Naikyoku with the consent of Shu-gikai)
Local organization (parish)
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): parish association (教区会) (representative of priests elected from each So) and parish lay followers association (教区門徒会) (representatives of lay followers elected by each So).
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): the committee of missionary work in parish (its chairman is the head of Kyomusho） and administrators of Shumu who reside in Kyomusho
The organization that corresponds to the judicial branch (a body for investigation): committee of inspectors
Local organizations (So(組))
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): So-kai (組会) (responsible official of each temple and church (representatives of priests in each temple and church) and So-Monto-kai (組門徒会) (representatives of lay followers in each temple and church)
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): disciplinary board of the So (its chairman is the head of the So, elected at the So-kai)
The organization that corresponds to the judicial branch (an investigative body): inspection committee
*Fifty-six branch temples are placed as a base for missionary work (聞信・宣布) in each domestic and overseas parish other than the above organizations.
Additionally, as a representative of priests and lay followers in the above organizations, Monshu, the Hongwan-ji-ha head priest, has been assigned and has been in charge of guarding the picture of Shinran, the founder of the sect, at Shinshu Hombyo, and reveres Buddha as a symbol of the sect, which believes the Shinshu sect teachings with other Doho (the present Monshu is the twenty-fifth Jonyo, Choken OTANI).
Additionally, although it is often confused, the Jodo Shinshu sect Higashi-Hongwan-ji-ha of which Head Temple is Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple in Taito Ward, Tokyo (the number of branch temples is 300 and several tens) defected and became independent from the Shinshu sect Otani-ha in 1981, because of the difference in the way of the sect, so currently they are different religious corporations (see "Ohigashi Turmoil (お東騒動)").
The religious community centered at Hongwan-ji Temple was originally one group, but at the beginning of the Edo period it was split into Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple's group and Nishi-Hongwan-ji Temple's group, which continue to this day.
The split of the Hongwan-ji Temple religious community into east and west originated from the difference of opinion within the community at the end of the Ikko Ikki (Ishiyama War) (1570-1580), which was fought around Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple at the end of the Age of Civil War.
Within the Hongwan-ji Temple religious community at the end of the Ishiyama War, there existed two opinions: the former was an opinion to support peace-making with the hostile Nobunaga ODA, and the latter was an opinion to insist on do-or-die resistance.
The eleventh Kennyo, who was the monshu of Hongwan-ji Temple at that time, withdrew Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple with the group that supported overall peace, but Kyonyo, the eldest son of Kennyo, temporarily stayed at Ishiyama with the group that supported do-or-die resistance and solicited support for the resistance group even after withdrawal.
This situation of a split in the religious community continued after Hongwan-ji Temple returned to Kyoto in 1591, having been given land for a temple (Nanajo Horikawa) by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.
Ieyasu TOKUGAWA focused attention on this and gave land to the east of Hongwan-ji Temple (Rokujo Karasuma) to Kyonyo in 1602, aiming for the deconcentration of the power of Hongwan-ji Temple, which was the largest religious group (Ieyasu had suffered through the Ikko Ikki when he was a lord of Mikawa Province and felt seriously threatened by the power of Hongwan-ji Temple).
Consequently, Hongwan-ji Temple split into Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple of which the twelfth monshu was Junnyo, the third son of Kennyo, (the present Jodo Shinshu sect Hongwan-ji-ha) and Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple of which the twelfth monshu was Kyonyo, the eldest son of Kennyo (the present Shinshu sect Otani-ha).
(*For the above, see the articles on the Jodo Shinshu sect and the history of Hongwan-ji Temple.)
It is said that such a situation reflects the above historical process because, while there are many branch temples and lay followers of Hongwan-ji-ha (Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple), especially in the Chugoku district (which is called 'Aki-monto' and so on), there are many branch temples and lay followers in the Hokuriku and Tokai districts, as seen in the location of branch temples and parishes (which are called 'Kaga-monto,' 'Owari-monto,' 'Mikawa-monto' and so on).
The founder, Shinran (1173-1262): Defined as 'the founder (the first chief priest) by Kakunyo, the third chief priest).
Kakushinni (1224?-1283?): Reburied Shinran's stone pagoda from Otani to Yoshimizu in 1272 and built Otani Mausoleum.
In 1277 she assumed the first Rusushiki (until 1283).
The second chief priest, Nyoshin (1235-1300): delegated the light of Buddhism in 1280.
(He delegated office work to Kakushinni and Kakue.)
He was defined as 'the second chief priest' by Kakunyo, the third chief priest.
Kakue (1239?-1307): Succeeded from Rusushiki in 1283 (until 1307).
*'The incident of Yuizen': Turmoil over the installation of Rusushiki between Kakue and Yuizen.
After Kakue's death, it was settled by the adjudication of Shorenin on July in 1309.
The third chief priest, Kakunyo (1270-1351): succeeded Rusushiki of Otani Mausoleum with the approval of lay followers in Eastern provinces in 1310.
(- 1314, 1322- 1338, 1342-1350) (repeated transfer and reinstatement)
*in 1321 he turned Otani Mausoleum into a temple, which became 'Hongwan-ji Temple.'
(In 1312 he put up the framework of 'Senju-ji Temple' but it was removed by Eizan's opposition.)
*In 1331 he wrote "Kuden-sho," expressed 'Ketimyaku (Lineage Through Blood, 血脈"), which is kept among three generations, and insisted on succeeding the light of Buddhism.
(Lineage of dharma (法脈): Honen⇒Shinran⇒Nyoshin⇒Kakunyo, lineage through blood: Shinran⇒Kakushinni⇒Kakue⇒Kakunyo)
Zonkaku (1290-1373): Succeeded from Rusushiki in 1314
(-1322, 1338-1342 (repeated removal and reinstatement by Kakunyo)
*In 1350 he was reconciled with Kakunyo.
He delegated the status of Hongwan-ji Betto (a status including the chief priest of the temple into Rusushiki) to Zennyo.
The fourth chief priest, Zennyo (1333-1389): Succeeded in 1350
The fifth chief priest, Shakunyo (1350-1393): Succeeded in 1390
(Soon after succession, he delegated the temple's office work to Konyo.)
The sixth chief priest, Konyo (1376-1440): Became the successor in 1394
The seventh chief priest, Zonyo (1396-1457)
The eighth chief priest, Rennyo (1415-1499): Passed over in 1489
The ninth chief priest, Jitsunyo (1458-1525)
The tenth chief priest, Shonyo (1516-1554)

The thirteenth chief priest, Sennyo (1604-1658)
The fourteenth chief priest, Takunyo (1625-1671): passed over in 1664.

The twenty-fourth chief priest, Kocho OTANI (1903-1993): passed over in 1993 with his entering nirvana.
From 1993 to 1996, due to the chaos caused by the Ohigasi Turmoil, monshu had been absent and Ennei OTANI Kagiyaku (1914-2008) had been put in charge as an alternate monshu.
The twenty-fifth chief priest, Choken OTANI (1930-): Succeeded in 1996
The Present Monshu
Reference: Shinshu Otani-ha Techo (published by Shinshu Otani-ha Shumusho Shuppanbu)
In order to communicate with government and other central institutions and to adjust policies in the capital, the Tokyo Local office was established.
(Chapter 6, Section 4, Article 59 of Shuken)
In order to manage local missionary work, the entire national territory was parochialized and Kyomusho was established in each parish.
(Source: Chapter 6, Section 5, Article 60 of Shuken)
Additionally, Otani-ha established a regional parish system (連区制), aiming to establish partnership with each parish on a regional scale in Japan and to promote missionary work more in each area.
There are five regional parishes of 'Hokkaido prefecture: 'Tohoku,' 'Hokuriku,' 'Tokai,' 'Kinki' and 'Kyushu.'
Branch temples are placed under the control of domestic parishes or overseas parishes.
(Source: Chapter 6, Section 5, Article 61 of Shuken)
A chief priest is appointed at a branch temple, and Monshu is in charge of this.
However, a person other than Monshu can become a chief priest.
(Chapter 7, Article 73 of Shuken)
A Rinban (輪番) is appointed at a branch temple.
A Rinban carries out for the work of chief priest and is a representative director of branch temple as a religious corporation.
(Chapter 7, Article 74 of Shuken)
Fifty-six temples exist as branch temples of the Shinshu sect Otani-ha as shown below, and the way of their establishment is as follows:
The case of establishment at an historical site of the founder of the sect or the successive monshu, or at venerable lands.
The case of establishment as the basis for the missionary work of each area
The case of establishment through a combination of the reasons mentioned above
Although there is a regional disproportion, it is placed nearly all over Japan (along with three overseas) and plays a role as a base of missionary work in each place.
Being greatly different from other traditional Buddhist sects, which interpret the concept of missionary work broadly and have no direct relationship with political movements as organizations, it conducts in-depth activities socially and politically with other Shinshu sects, so that there is such a criticism from inside and outside the sect, as it is too active in movements of a political and/or leftist nature.
Additionally, some priests and voluntary groups of followers are concerned with and see it as a problem that the activities of Otani-ha and Shinshu Kyodan Rengo consisting of ten groups of Shinshu sects (including Otani-ha) seem to incline toward the left.
Fudo Myoo (acala naatha in Sanskrit) is a subject of worship in Buddhism and one of the Myoo, a venerable status (尊格) that is specific to Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism.
It is also the Myoo that is the center of Godai Myoo (the five great myoo).
It is regarded as an incarnation of Dainichinyorai, which is the essential Buddha of Mikkyo, or an expression that shows its inner determination.
It has become popular as the name of 'Ofudo-san' and is called Dainichi Daisho Fudo Myoo, Mudo Myoo, Mudo-son, Fudo-son and so on.
Among Buddhist countries in Asia, it is believed with particular fervor in Japan, as exemplified by the numerous statues.
Moreover, Fudo Myoo is depicted on the Nichiren sect's main image (which is called Jikkai Mandala), and has been drawn by Shushi (Shuji, Bija) historically since Nichiren because it's a venerable status of Mikkyo, which was transmitted by Kukai, as well as Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja).
Moreover, it is said that Fudo Myoo in Nichiren's mandala shows that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana, while Aizen Myoo shows that the idea that earthly desires are a pure aspiration to enlightenment.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a sharp sword and kenjaku (kensaku, kenzaku) with a rope made from five different colored strands (blue, yellow, red, black and white).
Shushi (Mikkyo) (Shuji) is haaM or hmmaaM.
Mantra, Shingon, is used 'Noumaku Sanmanda Bazaradan Kan (namaH samanta vajraaNaaM haaM),' which is generally called Shoshu (小咒) or Ichiji-shu (一字咒).
Additionally, the Mantra 'Noumaku Sarabatatagyateibyaku Sarababokkeibyaku Sarabatatarata Sendamakaroshada Kengyakigyaki Sarababiginan Untarata Kanman (namaH sarvatathaagatebhyaH sarvamukhebhyaH, sarvathaa traT caNDamahaaroSaNa khaM khaahi khaahi sarvavighanaM huuM traT haaM maaM),' which is called Taichu (大咒) or Kakaishu (火界咒), and 'Noumaku Sanmanda Basaradan Sendanmakaroshadaya Sohatara Untarata Kanman (namaH samanta vajraaNaaM, caNDamahaaroSaNa sphoTaya huuM traT haaM maaM),' which is called Chushu (中咒) or Jiku-shu (慈救咒), are known.
Acala' in Sanskrit means 'unshakable' and 'naatha' means 'guardian,' so that as a whole it means 'unshakable guardian.'
In Tibetan Buddhism it is known more as Chanda Maharosha (caNDamahaaroSaNa), which is a fierce prickly god (暴悪忿怒尊), in comparison to this name.
However, this is shown as a figure having three eyes with wearing a fur coat and having its hair stand on end, so that it is to some extent different from the Fudo Myoo transmitted to Japan in the context of iconography.
It is said that the iconography of Fudo Myoo was introduced to Japan when Kobo-daishi Kukai transmitted Mikkyo from China.
The sacred name of 'Fudo' was seen for the first time as 'Fudo messenger' in 'Fukukenjaku Jimpen Shingonkyo Sutra,' which was translated by Bodairushi, Bodhiruci, in the early part of the eighth century.
Messenger' means a messenger of Dainichinyorai.
In Mikkyo one 'Buddha' is considered to appear in the three figures of 'jishorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of own-nature),' 'shoborinjin (shohorinjin, the embodiment of the wheel of the true Dharma)' and 'kyoryorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of injunction).'
Jishorinjin (Nyorai)' means the figure that embodies the universal truth and the state of enlightenment itself, while 'Shoborinjin (Bosatsu)' means the figure that preaches the universal truth and the state of enlightenment in an easily understood manner.
As opposed to these, 'kyoryorinjin' is the figure that implements intervention very aggressively as it admonishes a person who doesn't follow Buddhism even with the threat of an awful appearance, and compels the cessation of hostility toward Buddhism.
Fudo Myoo is said to be the kyoryorinjin of Dainichinyorai.
It is shown as a figure of anger in order to relieve the living things who suffer earthly desires and for whom relief is more difficult to find.
Besides, it is said that when Shaka determined that 'I won't stand up from here until I reach enlightenment' after other ascetic training for enlightenment and was seated under a lime tree, devils from all over the world poured in so as to defeat Shaka, but Shaka showed a gesture of Koma (降魔) using the fingers quietly, and by keeping a soft expression, and made the devils surrender immediately before its superior power.
Fudo Myoo is also said to be a figure that expresses Shaka's inner determination at that time.
It means that even in the calm and benevolent Shaka's mind there was the hardest heart that belied the determination to guard Buddhism.
It is also said that its expression of anger shows benevolent affection as a father who watches over his children, being a figure of paternal love that is tender in mind while on the outside it appears to be strict.
In 'Chirisanmaya-kyo Sutra' there is a story that Fudo Myoo defeated (調伏) Daijizaiten, Mahesvara, (Shiva, the supreme god in Hinduism).
According to the story, when Dainichinyorai reached enlightenment and became Buddha, all creatures in the three worlds came to a meeting, but Daijizaiten, who was conceited and considered himself to be the master of 3,000 worlds, did not accept the call.
Daijizaiten said, 'Jimyo-sya (持明者) (the spirit that uses magic in India, Yasha Myoo in this story) will come as a messenger, but its magic will become useless if I create dirty things with my magic, place them all around and stay inside,' and put up a barrier (結界) in order so as not to be approached.
When Fudo Myoo called for Daijizaiten, he was surrounded by a dirty barrier so that Fudo Myoo called back Fujo-kongo, a dirty water kongo (Ususama Myoo), and made him eat up the dirty barrier.
Then, Fudo Myoo captured Daijizaiten immediately and took him away to Buddha.
However, Daijizaiten said, 'You are only Yasha, a class of semidivinity usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified with malignant spirits, but I am a king of gods,' and was able to escape repeatedly.
Buddha ordered that 'he should be condemned to death,' so that Fudo Myoo stamped Daijizaiten and his wife (Uma) to death.
(Gozanze Yasha Myoo)
When Fudo Myoo asked Buddha how to deal with Daijizaiten, Buddha said, 'Revive him,' so Fudo Myoo revived him by reciting the Hokkaisei Shingon mantra (法界生真言).
When Daijizaiten was pleased and wondered, 'Who is this Yasha?' Buddha replied that he was 'the master of Buddhas.'
Daijizaiten was deeply moved, since he knew that there existed the master of Buddhas over respectable Buddhas in all things, and he obtained a certification (授記) to become a Buddha in the future, thanks to 'Daio (the great king)' of Fudo Myoo.
In this story it is characteristic that Fudo Myoo is called Yasha, Daio and the master of Buddha.
Although the statues of Myoo in Mikkyo are often shown as mysterious figures with many faces and many upper arms, Fudo Myoo is basically shown as a figure with one face and two upper arms (in the iconic collection of Mikkyo and others, Fudo Myoo with many bodies is also drawn, but it is rarely configured as a statue).
Additionally, many bodies of the statue are basically expressed in ugly, lurid colors.
It is said that this is a muddy color and shows the relief of the living things in the mud of earthly desires.
However, in Chiri-kyo Sutra and others its body color is described as blue-black or red-yellow and it is generally shaped as a figure with seven topknots or hachiyorenge (八葉蓮華) on the head with the right canine tooth bared upward and the left canine tooth bared outside, wearing clothing the color of red soil.
After it was imported to Japan, variations were created, but it remained a figure with one face and two arms.
Particularly since Fudo-ho, there was the popularization of the prayer for the aid of Fudo Myoo to end calamity and cause prosperity, by Kukai and Enchin, and many variations of the statue were produced.
Namikiri Fudo (Koyasan Nan-in Temple) associated with the historical event in which Kukai went to Tang, and Fudo Myoo, which is shown in yellow, red and blue colors based on Enchin's feelings, were created.
Goshiki Fudo, the Fudo statues shown with black, white, red, blue and yellow eyes, were also created, having been said to originate from the place names of Meguro and Mejiro (metropolitan Tokyo) (however, there are contrary opinions).
The features of statues are mostly those of fat youths (according to "Dainichi-kyo Sutra") who have turbulent hair by anger to bempatsu, a long rope of hair hanging down the left side of the face and the left shoulder of a sculpted figure in order to avoid being an obstacle to movement, are lightly dressed without hogu (the utensils used during ritual incantation and prayer) as much as possible, and have their clothing tied with a ripped sleeve.
It is said that its costume was based on a figure of slave or follower in ancient India so that it shows that it is a person who follows a disciplinant and guards him.
It is generally shown as a figure having a sankoken (three-pronged sword) in the right hand, of koma (which drives off Satan and cuts away people's earthly desires at the same time), kenjaku (a kind of lariat to tie evil and relieve people bound with earthly desires) in the left hand, shoulders the karuraen (a flame like the shape of 'Karura,' a firebird of legend that eats up three poisons), and determines, 'I shall not move from here until I relieve all people,' sitting on the rough rock (large rock) with an angry face (in Japan many standing statues are seen other than seated statues).
Fudo Myoo was created in India and transmitted to Japan through China, but there are very few works of statues in India and China.
In Japan, it was shaped actively in accordance with the prevalence of Mikkyo.
Among the existing statues of Fudo Myoo in Japan, the old statues such as the statue in the To-ji Temple Lecture Hall and the statue in To-ji Temple Mie-do, which were shaped at the first part of the Heian period, were produced by realistic expressions (with normal eyes) as it opened both eyes at the front, chewed the bottom lip with a front tooth and had both canine teeth bared downward.
However, in more recent years the statues with asymmetrical shapes such as heaven-and-earth eyes (天地眼) (open right eye and narrowed left eye, or staring up toward heaven with the right eye and staring down toward earth with the left eye), and having the right canine tooth bared upward and the left canine tooth bared downward (牙上下出).
This is influenced by 'Fudo Juku-kan (Nineteen Characteristic Signs of Fudo Myoo'), which was preached by Annnen, a priest of the Tendai sect, and others of the tenth century in order to image Fudo Myoo.
In more recent times the expression of Fudo Myoo statues with heaven-and-earth eyes had become almost completely mainstream, but even after that the statues with normal eyes in the old style, with eyes that were open and had both canine teeth biting the bottom lip, were seen somewhat, such as the standing statue of Fudo Myoo with two youths in Ganjoju-in Temple, Shizuoka, made by Unkei.
Because the standing statue of Fudo Myoo in Joraku-ji Temple in Kanagawa Prefecture, which was made by Unkei at nearly the same time of the Fudo Myoo statue in Ganjoju-in Temple, was shaped with heaven-and-earth eyes although its body was virtually identical to that of the statue in Ganjoju-in Temple, it seems that Unkei distinguished facial expressions.
Therefore, it could be said that whether the figure had normal eyes or heaven-and-earth eyes wasn't due to the difference in the times but instead depended on the client's intention, aims and so on.
It is known that this parquet statue made of Japanese cypress was shaped by Unkei with 10 artists specializing in Buddhist statues as his disciples (小仏師）at the request of Yoshimori WADA.
In some cases Fudo Myoo was shaped as a figure that brought followers (called hachidai-doji).
However, it is often shown on pictures and statues by the triad style which brought two youths of Kongara-doji (the youth Kongara) and Seitaka-doji (the youth Seitaka) among hachidai-doji (it is called the statue of Fudo Myoo with two youths or the Fudo triad).
In the triad style, it is common that Seitaka-doji is placed on the right of Fudo Myoo (on the observers' left) and Kongara-doji is placed on the left (on the observers' right).
Many kongara-doji are shown as baby-faced figures that stare toward Fudo Myoo intently with hands clasped in prayer, while on the contrary many Seitaka-doji are shown as naughty boys with kongosho (vajra club) and kongo-bo (both are weapons) in their hands.
The remaining six hachidai-doji are Eko-doji, Eki-doji, Anokuta-doji, Shitoku-doji, Ugubaga-doji and Shojo-biku.
As the works of these hachidai-doji, the statue in Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple Fudo-do (a national treasure) is well known.
At Setagayasan Kannon-ji Temple in the Setagaya Ward of Tokyo there are the statue of Fudo Myoo and the statue of hachidai-doji made by Koen (a grandson of Unkei), an artist of Buddhism statue in the Kamakura period, which were moved from the abolished Uchiyama Eikyu-ji Temple in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture.
Moreover, there is no work of Fudo Myoo with hachidai-doji as followers in Sanskrit sutras, so it is said to have been invented in China.
Additionally, there are the statues called the 36 youths or the 48 messengers.
They are often placed in the center of the main Myoo (which is called Godai Myoo), as are those of To-ji Temple.
Many sutras, including the Dainichi-kyo sutra, are preferred for reading, especially in Shugen-do.
Representative examples are as follows:
Shomudoson Daiinuo Himitsudarani-kyo Sutra
The story is that Fugen Bosatsu preached Fudo Myoo, which he felt, to the living things with Monju Bosatsu at the great Buddhist mass of Dainichinyorai, and that Dainichinyorai gave a favorable blessing.
Moreover, in the story of revenge by Kumawakamaru, a son of Suketomo HINO in Taiheiki, the scene whereby the practitioner escapes from the pursuer by boat while praying for Myoo is an homage of the part, 'It brings to the opposite share over sea by the boat of Buddhism (大法).'
Bussetsu Shofudo-kyo Sutra
It abstracts the essence of the above sutra's teaching, and was established in Japan.
It is written in the style that Fudo Myoo itself preaches.
It describes that Fudo Myoo lives in the disciplinant's mind (Fudo Myoo is indeed a disciplinant) because the ways of the living things' minds aren't the same (the way of reaching enlightenment is different individually) so that Fudo Myoo makes their wishes come true by changing its figure in accordance with each person).
Keishu Shomudoson Himitsudarani-kyo Sutra
It bears the strong influence of Mikkyo, such as the addition of a symbolic gesture with the fingers (印を結ぶ).
The following four are similar to Santan-kyo sutra (讃嘆経), which considers that Fudo Myoo is an existence that represents other venerable states and Japanese gods as well.
In those sutras Fudo Myoo is not described as a transcendental absolutist that is superior to other gods and Buddhas but is described on the basis of the above thought, that the way to reach enlightenment is different individually because the ways of living things' minds aren't the same).

Dainichinyorai (mahaavairocana in Sanskrit) is a venerable entity of the pantheistic Nyorai (the Dharmakaya Buddha), which is thought of as a unit of the universe itself in Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism).
Because its light shines over all the world, it is called Hensho or Dainichi.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a pagoda in Vajradhatumandala and Gorinto, the five-ring pagoda in Garbha-mandala.
Shushi (Mikkyo) (Shuji) was vaM in Vajradhatumandala and aaH or a in Garbha-mandala.
It is a hierarchy of Daibirushanabutsu-Jimpenkaji-kyo Sutra (Dainichi-kyo Sutra) and is the master of Garbha-mandala (the central Eight-Petal Court, or Chuudaiihachiyouin), as described by the Dainichi-kyo sutra.
Moreover, it's the center of Vajradhatumandala Gochi-nyorai (Five Wisdom nyorai, or Tathagatas), which the Kongocho-kyo sutra describes.
In the Shingon sect, which was founded by Kukai, it is the most important Buddha with which a disciplinant should ultimately integrate.
Fudo Myoo is regarded as an incarnation of Dainichinyorai, a fundamental Buddha in Mikkyo or an expression of its inner determination.
In Tibetan Buddhism, which greatly incorporates the latter part of Mikkyo, Dainichinyorai is revered as the center of the Five Buddhas (gobutsu) as well as Gochi-nyorai.
In Tibetan Buddhism it is commonly expressed as Nyorai's figure without jewelry or is sometimes drawn as a Buddha having many faces.
The form of statue is expressed by the seated figure like Bosatsu (Bodhisattva), who wears luxurious accessories such as a crown and a yoraku, a string of beads or lace-work used to decorate Buddhist statues and objects.
This imitates the figure of ancient Indian royalty.
Generally, Nyorai is expressed as a lightly dressed figure free of any accessory, but Dainichinyorai is particularly expressed as a monarch that wears the existence of the universe like an accessory.
The symbolic gesture with the fingers of Vajradhatu Dainichinyorai is Chiken-in (the knowledge-fist mudra), and that of Garbhadhatu Dainichinyorai is Hokkai Join (the Dharma-realm meditation mudra).
About the theory that Dainichinyorai originates from Ahura Mazda
There is a theory that Dainichinyorai (Makabirushanabutsu (Mahavairocana), mahaavairocana) originates from Ahura Mazda, the supreme god in Zoroastrianism.
It is based on the attribution of the sun and wisdom and the belief of fire, but there is a large disparity in dharmas between Zoroastrianism and Mikkyo.
There is another theory that Ahura Mazda originates from Varuna, a god of contract in Mitanni and Hittite.
This theory assumes that Varuna was a pair of Mithra (a god of light) since ancient times and that he was Asura, but there is no other significant similarity.
Additionally, there is the theory that Dainichinyorai originates from Virocana, the king of the Asura family in Indian mythology.
Moreover, the other theory considers it to be a unit of Dainichinyorai that developed from Vairocana, since the name is similar to Virocana, the hierarchy of the Kegon-kyo sutra.
It seems that the theory is based on the story of Chandogya Upanishad.
However, in 'the Mahdbharata,' an epic poem of India, Virocana means the sun god but doesn't necessarily mean only King Asura.
Moreover, since Visnu as the sun god also has this synonym, it isn't considered to be the immediate origin.
This theory that Dainichinyorai originates from King Asura and the supreme god of Zoroastrianism remains inconclusive.
(In fact, the origins of the other gods are often invalid except for the similarities among names.)

"Nyonin Kinsei (No Women Admitted)" means forbiddance for women to enter shrines and temples, reijo (sacred ground), ceremonial sites and others, as well as the limitation to unobstructed cultivation and worship by men.
There is a temporary Nyonin Kinsei which considers particular period related with women's menses as a period of abstention, while there is a permanent Nyonin Kinsei which constantly prohibits women's entering in distinction from men.
Particularly, the barrier to regulate women's entry to sacred mountains is called the 'nyonin kekkai,' and the stones to show the borderline for women were placed at that border.
However, for religious female believers Nyonin-do was built as a place where women could devote Buddhist invocations outside of the kekkai (border).
Additionally, the place which permits women to worship and practice unobstructed cultivation is called a 'nyonin koya.'
After the cultural enlightenment of the Meiji period, the stipulation of nyonin kekkai was released with regard to many sacred mountains.
Other places have also been released in recent years, in accordance with women's social progress and the discussion of 'nyonin kaikin (release for women) that followed.
The places that keep the tradition of Nyonin Kinsei remain only in a small proportion.
Nyonin kinsei, such as in regard to sacred mountains, are considered to be based mainly on Shugen-do's tradition.
Because Shugen-do was established through the syncretization of Buddhism (mainly Mikkyo, or Esoteric Buddhism) with the ancient Japanese Shinto faith, Taoism from China and others, it is difficult to clearly discern why it prohibits women's entry to sacred mountains.
The reason originated in Buddhist commandments
In the original Buddhism, no commandments existed that prohibited entry by women with barriers at particular places.
In Shobogenzo, written by Dogen, there is a criticism of nyonin kekkai in Japanese Buddhism as 'a laughing matter in Japan,' and Honen, Shinran and others were critical in their views of nyonin kekkai.
However, Buddhism considers human desires as bonno (earthly desires) and sees an ideal to control bonno by wisdom, so that it recommends the control of sexual desire, which is the most difficult human desire to overcome.
Accordingly, in the commandments for priests there are strict restrictions for activities that could stimulate sexual desires such as the prohibition of sexual intercourse (fuin-kai), that of masturbation (koshutsusho-kai), that of contact with women (shoku-nyonin-kai), that of using evil-minded words (sogo-kai), that of urging sexual intercourse as a memorial service (tanshinsaku-kuyo-kai), that of staying alone with a woman (byosho-fujo-kai), and that of doing what which incurs a doubt about their relationship at the time of being alone with a woman (rosho-fujo-kai).
Moreover, the mountaineering ascetic, who is a practitioner of austerities as half priest and half layman, also needs to keep at least fuin-kai during unobstructed cultivation (one of the hassai-kai, or eight precepts).
Incidentally, lay people are also prohibited from indecent sexual acts (such as premarital intercourse, extramarital affair, adultery, indecent assault, bestiality and rape) as fujain-kai (no sexual misconduct) (one of the five commandments).
Additionally, it is recommended that lay people keep fuin-kai only during the period in which they devote unobstructed cultivation, such as in Zen seated meditation and Buddhist invocation.
It seems that in order to achieve those goals, women were removed from the places of unobstructed cultivation by men in Shugen-do.
On the contrary, nunneries (facilities for priestesses) were originally specified as facilities attached to temples with a resident priest (facilities for priests) (for the purpose of protecting the priestess from sexual violence) so that it was difficult to remove men on a strict basis.
Additionally, in Buddhism it was originally prohibited for priests or priestess (except Buddha) to make a member of the opposite sex enter the Buddhist priesthood as a disciple (in order to avoid the ruination of the priest who would have his mistress around him as a disciple).
(Only a priest can make a man enter the Buddhist priesthood, and only Ama (nun) can make a woman enter the Buddhist priesthood.)
The facility necessary for entering Buddhist priesthood is called the kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform).
The person who entered priesthood for the first time in Japan was an ama, but from the Nara period to the Kamakura period when the placement of a kaidan needed permission from the Imperial Court, all kaidans such as those at Todai-ji Temple and Enryaku-ji Temple were subject to male priests so that it is believed the difficulty of women's jikai (handing down the precepts) and tokudo (entry to the Buddhist priesthood) were related to nyonin kinsei.
However, Buddhist commandments are different among priests, practitioners of austerities and lay people as mentioned above, and there are differences among sects in the contents of commandments as well as their interpretations and severity.
Therefore, some nunneries adopt the policy of 'no men admitted' and some temples in mountain areas do not adopt nyonin kinsei.
The reason for the uncleanliness of blood in Shinto
In Shinto, the blood that is separated and flows from the body of a living thing is considered to be unclean.
(This is the concept of considering a part of the body, meaning what is separated from the body, as unclean, which is also perceived in regard to the hair, nails and released bodily fluids; and similar ideas exist in other religions and myths.)
For this reason there has, since ancient times, been a taboo that prohibits women in menstruation and puerperal period from entering sacred places (such as shrines) and touching sacred things (such as a mikoshi, or a sacred palanquin).
Originally, not only women but also men bloodied due to injuries were prohibited from entering sacred places, while hunting and other activities in sacred places were prohibited for the same reason; however, it seems that based on a characteristic of male chauvinist thinking in the feudal era, only the uncleanliness of blood during menstruation and puerperal period had been emphasized and used as the reason for the removal of women from sacred places.
The faith in divine power such as in Taoism and Mikkyo
There is a theory that this is due to the expectation of power in Buddhism and divine power by incantation and prayer against priests, mainly as influenced by Taoism and Mikkyo in ancient Japan.
It was thought that the thorough sila (morality) was necessary in order to keep the power of Buddhism, which was needed for priest's prayer.
Among the stories in which Sennin, a wizard, loses divine power due to his sexual desire, the story of Kume-no-sennin in "Konjaku Monogatari (Tales of Times Now Past)" is famous.
According to that story, he was attracted by young woman's white shins who was washing clothes on the shore of Kume-gawa River, lost divine power, fell down from heaven and married with that woman.
The syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism in medieval times
It is thought that different views on the taboos of Buddhism, Shinto and Taoism as above were syncretized in medieval times, and that the basic idea of present Nyonin Kinsei and Nyonin Kekkai was established led by mountain temples and Shugen-do around the Kamakura period.
Additionally, since the Kamakura period more and more of the literature distorted and cited a description in consciousness-only theory of ' 女人地獄使。能断仏種子。外面似菩薩。内心如夜叉 (Women are messengers from hell. They can cut Buddha's seeds. Their outside faces resemble Bosatsu. Their minds are like Yasha (devil))' (there is a superstition adapted from the Kegon-kyo Sutra) and another description in the Hoke-kyo Sutra of ' 又女人身。猶有女人五障説 (There exist women. There is a theory that women are five obstacles)' as 'Because women are unclean, they can neither become Buddha nor be relieved,' apart from the original meanings or contexts.
(No such meaning is found in the originals.)
For these reasons nyonin kinsei is sometimes interpreted as being based on the philosophy regarding women in Kamakura Buddhism.
However, it should be noted that there were founders of sects in the Kamakura period, such as Honen and Dogen, who were critical of nyonin kinsei.
Other factors contributing to the origin of nyonin kinsei
Additionally, there is an opinion that it is because the place of unobstructed cultivation in Shugen-do was in a severe, trackless mountain area.
Alpine climbing accidents are not rare, even today.
Moreover, in ancient times mountain areas were thought to be dangerous places where the evil spirits of the mountains and rivers lived.
Therefore, mountain areas were places that women, who could give birth, did not or must not approach in order to ensure their safety.
On the contrary, because mountain areas were such places, practitioners of austerity chose them as places of severe unobstructed cultivation where men could not be caught up in thoughts of women.
Once the mountain path had come to be maintained well in accordance with civilization, religious women began to climb the mountains, relying on the mountaineering ascetic; this confounded the mountaineering ascetics, who then determined the borderlines of taboo by putting barrier stones and built women's halls for prayer and preaching.
Kunio YANAGIDA, a scholar of folklore, paid attention to the barrier stone called Uba-ishi at the start of a trail up Mt. Iwaki-san (or Ubasute-yama), a mountain where old women would be abandoned, and in "Imo-no-chikara" and "Bikuni-ishi" introduced a legend that a woman who crossed over the barrier stone would change into a stone.
It was thought that the area beyond the barrier stone or border stone was the other world (the other world over the mountain) and that a religious person could gain a superpower by doing unobstructed cultivation in a kind of other, cloistered world.
Moreover, there is a theory that it was caused by avoiding the jealousy of female gods because the mountain god Iwanaga-hime had, since ancient times, been considered to be a female.
For example, in the legend of Tono three mountains, which are seen in "Tono Monogatari (Tale of Tono)," each of three female gods lived in Mt. Hayachine-san and Mt. Rokkoshi-san, and they had kept nyonin kinsei for a long time.
It could be thought that this was a taboo myth in order that women would not approach dangerous mountains.
However, Tagiri-bime, a god of Munakata-taisha Shrine Okitsunomiya on Oki-no-shima Island, which today keeps nyonin kinsei, is also a female god so that the myth that female gods were jealous and abhorred women might be established differently.
According to the other theory, there is an explanation that women have difficulty practicing severe unobstructed cultivation because 'women tend to be psychic,' like priestesses and Itako (people who can communicate with the dead).
As the reasons for Nyonin Kinsei, there exist various origins and theories as mentioned above.
In each place, each origin has been transmitted.
Additionally, there is a case that these were combined and changed over a period of history so that it is said to be difficult to reach general ideas from any one originating point.
Additionally, it could be thought that the time when nyonin kinsei was adopted in festivals was the Edo period or after Meiji period when male chauvinism became widespread, and in "Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)" there is a description that women would join in festivals.
Moreover, in ancient Japan women were believed to be sacred persons who were generally haunted spirits, so that women were thought to have many qualifications for being enshrined as god, as represented by Himiko.
For example, in Okinawa, where Shinto is said to remain in its original form, women were called 'kaminchu' (men were called uminchu) and no men were admitted in the place where Shinto priest (such as Noro) would perform religious services, as opposed to nyonin kinsei.
A trace of this custom remains today.
On November 3, 2005, the members of 'a project to climb Mt. Omine-san,' which was set up by dissenters against the nyonin kinsei of Mt. Omine-san, visited the spot in order to climb Mt. Omine-san, and requested the release to the temple's side by submitting a questionnaire, but it ended in failure.
As a result, both sides agreed to have a chance to talk another day and broke up, but immediately after that the three women of the project stubbornly climbed the mountain in order to assert their view of the problem.
Against this action, criticism came from the temple's side, local people in opposition and portions of the mass media.
While there is an opinion that "praises" the activity of the project side (it is a gesture of agreement with male chauvinism and an evil custom that is opposed to the principle of gender equality), there is another opinion that nyonin kinsei should be maintained firmly (it succeeds the religious and traditional culture that is rooted in Japan and does not promote discrimination such as male chauvinism so that the enforcement of mounting climbing is a hasty and foolish action that violates Japanese culture).
Additionally, there is an opinion that criticizes the project side from the standpoint of the freedom of religion (even if a certain faith or custom seems to be superstitious in the context of modern values, it is not good to carelessly and forcibly abandon it so high-handedly, but instead one should wait for the believers to reform voluntarily).
Moreover, some intellectuals criticize the project side because they do not act to require abolishment or amendment against the festivals and places in which traditionally no men are admitted, as a contrary practice in Japan (such as Utaki (Okinawa)).

The Lineage of Shinto
Oki-no-shima Island: Even men must purify themselves by abstaining from eating meat at the time of entry.
Tanabu Matsuri Festival (Mutsu City Aomori Prefecture): In recent years women have been permitted to pull floats, but basically it adopts nyonin kinsei so that women are not permitted to ride on floats.
Kanto poles (Akita City)
Yamahoko floats in the Gion Matsuri Festival (Kyoto City): There are women's Hayashi-kata in some Yamahoko floats, but nyonin kinsei is adopted in regard to Naginata-boko, the first float of the parade.

Juichimen Kannon (ekadaza mukha in Sanskrit) is one of the venerable entities of Bosatsu, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
The Sanskrit name means 'eleven faces.'
It is one of the transformed bodies of Kannon Bodhisattva (Kannon Bosatsu) and is one of the Roku Kannon (Six Kannons).
As the features were explained in 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra' translated by Genjo, it is a Bosatsu having 11 faces on the head except for a face on the main body.
The sanmayagyo (symbol) is a suihei, a small water bottle, and a glowing lotus.
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) (Shuji) is ka and hriiH.
It is also called Daikofusho Kannon, and it is said that the 10 faces on the front, back, left and right among the 11 faces on the head show Jicchi (ten stages) while the topmost Butsumen (the head of a Buddha) shows Buddhahood, or nirvana.
It is said that this shows the pious act of cutting away 11 kinds of ignorance and the earthly desires (無明煩悩) of living things, and to open Buddhahood.
It is also called Daihi Sendai because it has a vow as 'I do not stop without relieving people (救わで止まんじ).'
As a role of Roku Kannon, it civilizes (摂化) living things in Ashura-do (the Asura realm).
In Japanese it has various names such as 'Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu' and 'Juichimen Kanzeon Bosatsu,' but the name assigned as a national treasure or important cultural property is 'Juichimen Kannon.'
It seems to be a venerable status (尊格) that originated in India, but there is no distinguished work in India; however, its statues were produced eagerly in China and Japan through the dissemination of 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra' translated by Genjo in Tang.
In Japan, the statues of Juichimen Kannon were produced and worshipped eagerly since the Nara period, and the statue of Juichimen Kannon in the wall paintingof Horyu-ji Temple Kondo (法隆寺金堂) (which was damaged by a fire in 1949) seems to be the oldest work.
The other works from the Nara period are the statue of Shorin-ji Temple in Nara (a national treasure, coming from Daigorin-ji Temple (Omiwa-tera Temple), which is a jingu-ji temple (a temple associated with a shrine) in Omiwa-jinja Shrine) and the statue of Kannon-ji Temple in Kyoto (a national treasure), the statue of Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (an important cultural property) and so on.
The principal image of Buddha of Nigatsu-do in Todai-ji Temple is also Juichimen Kannon, but its feature is not clear because it is a Buddhist image that has infrequently been shown to the public since ancient times.
Omizutori,' an annual event of that temple, is the event for the confession of sins to Juichimen Kannon (Juichimen Keka Hoyo).
Additionally, according to folklore, Taicho, a priest of Shugen-do (an ancient Japanese religion) in the Nara Period, had practiced asceticism while praying Juichimen Kannon since childhood, opened Hakusan, which is famous as Reijo (sacred ground) and succeeded in placing (感得) Myori Gongen, which had Juichimen Kannon as its honji (substance).
After the Heian period, Shuei, who learned the ways of both the Shingon and Tendai sects, moved this Myori Gongen to Hieizan Enryaku-ji Temple, which is one of the Sanno Shichisha (Seven Sanno Shrines) as Kyakujin Gongen (an enshrined diety to pray for the increase of customers in merchant families).
Juichimen Kannon is seen as a Bosatsu that performed the pious act of removing all hardships from living things due to its deep mercy, so that many statues had been produced in figures such as that of a goddess.
Many statues of Juichimen Kannon put Kebutsu (the artificial Buddha) on the front top of the head and put faces of emotions such as Butsumen, Bosatsumen (Bodhisattva heads), Shinnumen (three angry faces), Kugejoshutsumen (plain faces with fangs) and Daishomen (a laughing face) on the head while letting the right hand hang down, and having in the left hand a vase in which there is a lotus.
This is based on 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra,' translated by Genjo.
Shinnumen is an expression of anger with the arching of the eyebrows and a downturned mouth; Kugejoshutsumen is an expression in which a canine tooth is bared between pressed lips, and Daishomen is an expression of a smile, more specifically a big grin.
Usually, Butsumen is put atop the head, Bosatsumen (three faces) at the front side on the head, Shinnumen (three faces) on the left side (on the observers' right), Kugejoshutsumen (three faces) on the right side (on the observers' left) and Daishomen (one face) on the back which can not be seen from observers.
According to 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra,' the right hand which is hanging down has a beadroll and the left hand holds a vase with a red lotus in it.
However, in the case of statue, beadroll in the right hand is often omitted or lost.
On the other hand, the statue of Juichimen Kannon as a principle image of Buddha in Hase-dera Temple (真言宗豊山派総本山長谷寺), the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Buzan-ha, has as is customary a lotus in a vase in the left hand, but it is the greatest characteristic that it has a big shakujo (pewter staff) and stands upon a rock.
The statues of Juichimen Kannon that are placed in many Buzan-ha temples show these features, and consequently they are called 'Juichimen Kannon of the Hase-dera style.'
In the pure esoterica that was transmitted by Kukai, the statues with four arms were produced based on the sutra translated by Fuku, but the statues with two arms were predominant in Japan.

Jizo Bosatsu (d kSiti gharbha in Sanskrit) is one of the venerable entities of Bosatsu, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
d kSiti' means 'the earth' and 'gharbha' means 'in the womb' or 'womb,' but it is freely translated into 'Jizo.'
It is also translated into Jiji, Myodo and Muhenshin.
The sanmayagyo (symbols) are Nyoi-hoju (a sacred jewel that is said to remove suffering and be capable of granting every wish), Doban (a kind of sublime article, a rod with a streamer on the top) and Shakujo (a pewter staff).
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) (Shuji) is ha.
It is named after the belief that it enwraps troubled people with its immeasurably great mercy and saves them, such that the earth has the power to cultivate all lives.
It is generally believed to be 'a protective deity of children' so that the sweets that children love are often offered on the altar.
Generally, it is affectionately called 'Ojizo-san' or 'Ojizo-sama.'
It is considered that it follows Shaka-muni Buddha in the Touriten (Trayastrimsa heaven) and senses the capability of living things each morning in Dhyana (meditation), and that it is a Bosatsu that relieves living things who live in the wheel of life of Rikudo (the six realms of Jigoku-do (Naraka realm, or hell realm) (地獄道), Gaki-do (Preta realm, or hungry ghost realm), (餓鬼道), Chikusho-do (Animal realm) (畜生道), Shura-do (Ashura realm, or realm of demigods) (修羅道), Jin-do (Human realm) (人道) and Ten-do (Deva realm, or realm or blissful state) (天道), while there exists no Buddha in this world after Shaka entered nirvana and before Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva) appears, 5670 million years later.
Many statues are generally expressed in the figure of a shaven Shomon or Bikuni (figures of priests or priestesses) putting on robes with Nyoi-hoju in the left hand and Shakujo in the right hand or with Nyoi-hoju in the left hand and Yogan-in figurative gestures (wish-granting mudra, showing the palm and hanging down) in the right hand.
However, in Mikkyo it is expressed in the normal figure that piles its hair high and wears accessory as a principal image of Garbha-mandala Jizo-in; it has Nichirin (日輪) in front of the right-side breast in the right hand and has a lotus that bears Doban while placing the left hand on the left hip.
The benefits of Jizo Bosatsu Hongan Kudoku-kyo sutra are as follows:
Twenty-eight benefits

Among Enra-o-juki Shishu Gyakushu Shoshichiojo Jodo-kyo Sutra (閻羅王授記四衆逆修生七往生浄土経) (Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra, Yuxiu Shiwang Shengqijing Sutra) and Juo-kyo Sutra (Jizo Bosatsu Hossin Innen Juo-kyo Sutra), a belief that Jizo Bosatsu is the same entity as Enma, tied with Juo belief in Taoism.
According to that, the king Enma watches people closely as Jizo Bosatsu so that he can fairly bring the dead to justice.
In Japan since the Heian period, when the Pure Land Faith was widespread, people increasingly believed that the living things who could not be reborn in the Land of Bliss after death inevitably went to Hell, so that they had to hope from Jizo Bosatsu for relief from their suffering in Hell.
There is a folk belief that Jizo Bosatsu guards children who are bullied by ogres at Sai-no-kawara (the limbo of children) so that Jizo Bosatsu has been worshipped for the veneration of children and miscarried fetuses.
Moreover, in the Kansai district Jizo Bon is held as a children's festival.
Additionally, it has been syncretized with Doso-shin (Doso-jin), the traveler's guardian deity, so that many stone statues were enshrined by the roadsides throughout Japan.
In China, Jizo Bosatsu is called Jizo-o Bosatsu (tied with Juo thought) and is worshipped as a master of the underworld.
Because it brings the dead to justice as the king Emma, it is mainly worshipped in order to wish for relief (from Hell) after death.
In the Naka Ward of Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture (Japan) there exists Jizo-o-byo Temple (Chuka Giso) (Chinese cemetary), which was built by Chinese residents and enshrines the rest of the dead.
The sacred place of Jizo-o Bosatsu is Mt. Jiuhuashan, in Anhui Province.
This is based on the fact that a priest Jizo (696 to 794), who is also called Kin-osho or Kana Jizo in Shiragi, the Silla dynasty, lived in Huacheng Temple at this place.
Jizo, who entered nirvana in this place at the age of 99, remained the same figure as living when his casket was opened three years later in order to be enshrined in a tower, so that the faith to see him as the same as Jizo-o Bosatsu was created and the place of the tower became a sacred site of Jizo-o Bosatsu.
According to that historical event, it has been worshipped until now as a sacred place in Chinese Buddhism, as have Mt. Wutai Shan of Monju Bosatsu, Mt. Emeishan of Fugen Bosatsu and Mt. Putuo of Kannon Bosatsu.
In Japan the statues of Rokujizo, which consist of six statues of Jizo Bosatsu, are enshrined in various places.
This is originated from a theory that six kinds of Jizo Bosatsu relieve each of the six worlds, based on the Buddhist concept of Rokudo-rinne or Rebirth in the Six Worlds (whereby all lives repeat incarnation in the six worlds).
Each name of Rokujizo is unauthorized.
In many cases they are called Danda Jizo, Hoju Jizo, Hoin Jizo, Jiji Jizo, Jogaisho Jizo, Nikko Jizo or Kongogan Jizo, Kongoho Jizo, Kongohi Jizo, Kongodo Jizo, Hokoo Jizo, Yotenga Jizo in the order of Jigoku-do, Gaki-do, Chikusho-do, Shura-do, Jin-do and Ten-do, but some documents describe names other than the above.
At any rate, it is nearly impossible to determine each name of Jizo Bosatsu only by its features.
In Japan the statues of Rokujizo are often enshrined at the entrances to cemeteries and so on.
In the Golden Hall of Chuson-ji Temple, each of six statues of Jizo Bosatsu are placed on the three Buddhist altars in which the bodies of FUJIWARA no Kiyohira, FUJIWARA no Motohira and FUJIWARA no Hidehira are placed, and the figures of each statue are nearly identical to one another.
A long time ago there lived two kings who were abundantly merciful in India.
One of the kings thought he would relieve people by becoming Buddha by himself, and he became the Buddha called Issaichii-nyorai.
However, the other king dared to reject becoming Buddha in spite of being capable of doing so; instead he willingly went to Hell, keeping his human form, and continuously endeavored to relieve all the troubles and wandering of souls.
He is Jizo Bosatsu.
There are many stories that the miraculous efficacy of Jizo Bosatsu is enormous enough to diminish people's sins and make them Buddha, and that he relieves people as a scapegoat for their suffering.
Although Bosatsu is a Buddha ranked at high status next to Nyorai, Jizo Bosatsu stepped down from the status with the determination that ' I won't go back to the Bosatsu world unless my wish to relieve all living things comes true,' and he continued travel to relieve unrelieved living things and the souls of young children who died before their parents, walking on foot through Rokudo.
It is said that a young child who dies before his parents cannot cross the Sanzu River but must continue to build a stone stupa forever; that he must suffer from the bullying of ogres at Sai-no-kawara because he makes his parents grieve; and that he will not accrue pious acts of filial devotion to his parents.
There is a famous anecdote that Jizo Bosatsu is first to go to Sai-no-kawara and guards children from ogre, gives virtue by preaching Buddhism dharma and sutras, and leads them to the way to become Buddha.
As mentioned above, Jizo Bosatsu is the Bosatsu who relieves the weakest people above everything else, so that he has been worshipped enormously since ancient times.
Relationship to the Hungry Ghosts' Feeding Festival
In more recent times there has been a widespread story that the spot under Jizo Bosatsu's feet is the entrance of the world of Gaki (hungry ghosts).
When water is poured on the statue of Jizo Bosatsu, it pours into the mouth of Gaki, who suffers forever in the netherworld.
It is said that although Gaki in Buddhism has a burning tongue because of the sin of having told a lie in life so that he cannot drink or eat because everything in his mouth is burned away, the water through Jizo Bosatsu's mercy can reach Gaki's throat and he can interrupt suffering for a while (during which people pray for Gaki to become Buddha by reading mass and reciting sutras with great virtue as part of the Hungry Ghosts' Feeding Festival).
This is a story that shows the pious acts of Jizo Bosatsu, who is said to pour mercy upon all six worlds without prejudice; accordingly, the Hungry Ghosts' Feeding Festival was established as associated with Jizo Bosatsu.
In Buddhism a nefarious person who denies and criticizes Buddhism is called ichi-sendai (一闡提) (or simply sendai), which also means simply 'a person who has difficulty becoming Buddha,' so that Bosatsus such as Jizo Bosatsu and Kannon Bosatsu, who dared not to become Buddha through their great mercy in relieving all living things, are called 'Daihi Sendai' and are clearly distinguished from the normal sendai.
The above 'Rokujizo' is Jizo-son (statues of Jizo), who guards each of the six worlds, and therefore many statues were placed at funeral homes and graves.
Additionally, it was combined with the faith for Doso-shin (Japanese Shinto deity), so many statues were built as 'guardian deities of the barriers of town' outside of towns or on streets.
Jizo Bon is a festival that enshrines this as a principle image.
Moreover, because Doso-shin is called Shaguji, the Jizo Bosatsu that syncretized with Doso-shin came to be called Shogun (将軍) Jizo by combining the letters of "Shogun" with "Shaguji" (it is also written as 勝軍 (Shogun)).
In a folkloric tale "Journey to West," Jizo-o Bosatsu is described as he tells Gyokukotaitei (玉皇大帝) in Heaven about the violence of Sun Wu Kong (Seitentaisei, 斉天大聖), from Hell, as a master of the underworld.
On Kakaka Bisanmaei Sowaka (唵 訶訶訶 尾娑摩曳 娑婆訶)
The gods regarded as Honji Suijaku of Jizo Bosatsu in the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism are Atago-no-kami (a deity) and Amenokoyane.

Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja) is one of the Myoos (king of wisdom), being worshipped in Buddhism and having venerable status specific to Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism).
Having a Sanskrit name, Ragaraja, which is not seen in Buddhist sutras such as those of India, is a Funnu-son--a deity with a fierce expression (忿怒尊)--whose works are not found in India either.
One of the reasons living things do not believe in Buddhism is that 'they are fascinated by temporal pleasures such as bonno (earthly desires) and sexual desire,' but Aizen Myoo practices pious acts because 'bonno and sexual desire are human's instincts that are difficult to cease, so that I change these instincts into ambitions and make living things believe in Buddhism.'
Aizen Myoo has one face and six arms with Funnu-so (an angry expression found on Buddhist images just like other Myoos), and it has highly distinctive features such as a lion's crown, which symbolizes the strength to bear any problem, as well as a seated lotus position on a lotus flower blossoms in a hobyo (a flower vase), which is filled with wisdom.
Because it was originally a god to express love, the body color is red and it is often depicted with a luminous halo.
Additionally, there exists a figure of Aizen Myoo that draws a bow toward Heaven (such as 'the statue of Aizen Myoo with celestial bow' at Mt. Koya) and pictures on which different features are drawn, such as two heads.
It has a third eye on the forehead, and some people say this depicts female genitalia.
However, the reason for that view is not known and it is uncertain whether it is true.
Aizen Myoo has been worshipped since ancient times as a Buddha that controls 'love, marriage and household harmony,' as its name shows; moreover, it has been worshipped as a guardian deity of dye and textile manufacturers by interpreting 'Aizen(愛染) as Aizen (藍染), or indigo.'
Moreover, because it does not deny sexual desire, it was worshipped by prostitutes in ancient times and is worshipped by women of the present day who work in the nighttime entertainment industry.
Aizen Myoo is also depicted in pictures of the Mandala, a principal image of the Nichiren sects, facing Fudo Myoo; and it has been written in Sanskrit since Nichiren through the ages because it has a venerable status of Mikkyo transmitted by Kukai.
Moreover, it is said that Fudo Myoo in the Mandala of Nichiren sects shows the idea that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana while Aizen Myoo shows the idea that earthly desires are a pure aspiration to enlightenment.
The theoretical origin of Aizen Myoo is not known, but judging from one of the mantras of Aizen Myoo, 'Fun Takki Fun Jaha Fun,' it seems related to Takkiraja (Kama Raja （カーマ・ラージャ)), the tenth Funnu-son in the latter stage of Mikkyo.
It is said that the word "takki" means love or death, but the exact origin of the word is not known.
There is a theory that Takki originates from Dakini (ダーキニー) (Dakiniten).
Dakini is often considered to be a witch, and therefore Takkiraja could be translated as the king of witches in Japanese.
Alternatively, Takki might be a lost god or a slang term.
Kama is a goddess of love who was burned to death because she released an arrow against Shiva during ascetic practices.
The goddess Kama, which is also called Mara, seduced Buddha.
Mara has a daughter named Raga.
For details, see the article on Kama (Hinduism).
Mara is the supreme god who lives in the sixth heaven, which is also called Take-jizai-ten (the heaven where one can partake of the pleasures created in other heavens) or the sixth tenmao (devil).
For details, see the article on Tenma.
(Kama is the supreme god in Heaven, but please note that there are more worlds over heaven in Buddhism.)
Take-jizai-ten is expressed as a figure with a bow, and it is a god that controls everything in this world at will, makes others enjoy and enjoys by itself.
From the other perspective, it is a god and a seducer that makes a person feel happy.
It is said that Dainichinyorai preached at the palace of Take-jizai-ten.
Aizen Myoo could be said to be a god that changed the viewpoint against love and mastered it.
It seems that Kongoai Bosatsu is the nearest as a venerable status and was incorporated from a god who drew a bow of love or a god of love with a bow; it is interpreted as a Bosatsu in Mikkyo so that its Funnu-son corresponds to Aizen Myoo.
Although Aizen Myoo is often enshrined as an attendant, there are examples in which it is enshrined as the principal image, as follows:
Temples that enshrine Aizen Myoo as the principal image
Aizen-do (Shoman-in Temple) (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) - one of the four halls of Shitenno-ji Temple built by Prince Shotoku
The first Fudasho, a temple that issues amulets, of Saigoku Aizen Reijo (holy grounds related to Aizen Myoo in the western districts of Japan) (西国愛染霊場).
Kongosanmai-in Temple (Koya-cho, Wakayama Prefecture) - the temple related to Masako HOJO.
It enshrines Aizen Myoo, which was Nenjibutsu (a Buddhist image that is kept in close proximity for personal daily worship) of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.
The principal image is a national important cultural property.
Shana-in Temple (Nagahama City, Shiga Prefecture) - the principal image is made in the Kamakura period and a national important cultural property.
It is said that it was consecrated by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.
Aizen-in Temple (Nerima Ward, Tokyo) - the principal image is the statue of Aizen Myoo, which is a Buddhist image not usually shown to the public.
Komyosan Aizen-in Temple (光明山愛染院) (Itabashi Ward, Tokyo) - worshipped by local dye manufacturers
Other representative temples that enshrine Aizen Myoo
Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City, Nara Prefecture): This statue of Aizen Myoo (an important cultural property) was made by Zenen.
It is placed at Aizen Hall, which was formerly Konoe-ko Mandokoro Goten(近衛公政所御殿) in Kyoto Imperial Palace but was relocated there.
Jingo-ji Temple (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City) - the statue of Aizen Myoo (an important cultural property) was made by Koen, who was a busshi.
Jindo-ji Temple (Yamashiro-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto Prefecture) - the statue of Aizen Myoo with celestial bow
A statue in the Nara National Museum - the statue of Aizen Myoo (an important cultural property) was made byKaisei, a busshi in the Kamakura period.

Zazen (meditation) is a fundamental method of training in Zen Buddhism, in which one meditates sitting with correct posture.
It is sometimes written with the characters 座禅 however it is correct to use the character 坐.
Harmonize posture, breathing and mind. (choshin, chosoku, choshin respectively)
A special cushion for Zazen called a zafu is used when sitting down to meditate.
A zabuton (flat cushion) folded in two can sometimes serve as a substitute.
Sit down cross-legged on the cushion, with knees barely touching the floor.
Zazen is done in either full-lotus position or half-lotus position.
To sit in the full-lotus position, put the right foot on the left thigh and move the right heel close to the hip.
Next, put the left foot on the right thigh.
In half-lotus position only the left foot is put on the right thigh.
In either position, the three points including two legs and bottom make a balanced sitting posture.
The hands are placed together palms up with the thumbs touching in a natural arc in the hokkai-join or gesture of reality.
Face the right palm upwards and place the left palm on top.
Lightly touch the tips of the thumbs together.
With eyes half open, lower gaze to a point about one meter in front.
Pull chin in, and rest the tongue lightly on the roof of the mouth behind the front teeth, keeping mouth lightly closed.
Relax shoulders and straighten the spine.
Pull the back in and the stomach slightly forward.
Such that the nose and navel are in line.
Breathe naturally.
Breathe out and in gently from the nose.
It is said to exhale from the 'tanden' (a point in the lower abdomen).
Some temples hold zazen meetings.
Also, the correct way to do zazen is broadcast on A and available for viewing free.
Zazen is sometimes perceived as the same as visual meditation ('meiso'), however the direction of zazen is different to that of visual meditation in which the eyes are closed and an object is visualized in the mind.
The purpose of zazen is not to be bound by the images in your mind but to experience the world and yourself as it really is, and reach a spiritual place of nothingness.
The priest Dogen, founder of the Soto Sect of Buddhism, emphasized the concept of 'shikantaza' which is a Japanese term for zazen and means just sitting.
It means to just sit for the sake of sitting, and not for the purpose of gaining some merit or reward.
Medicine
Medical researchers are studying the slowing of breathing during zazen meditation.
Seiryu Gongen (清瀧権現), or Seiryo Gongen, is a guardian goddess of Daigo-ji Temple, the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Daigo-ha branch in the Fushimi Ward of Kyoto City.
Additionally, it is called Seiryu Daigongen (Seiryo Daigongen) and is also written as 清滝権現 (Seiryu Gongen, Seiryo Gongen).
Honjibutsu, the original Buddhist identity of a Shinto deity, is Jundei Kannon and Nyoirin Kannon.
Seiryu Gongen isn't described in Kyoki (sutra), but according to Kukai's Goyuigo (written will) it was Zennyo Ryuo, (Dragon King Zennyo) the third (also said to be fourth) daughter of Shakara (Sakara, Shagara), one of the Hachidai Ryuo (the eight dragon kings of Indian myth), and lived in Munetsuchi (無熱池) (a legendary pond that is said to be located in the Himalayas).
There are two kinds of dragons--good and evil--and Zennyo Ryuo was a good dragon who did not do harm; it is a golden snake of 2.5 cm long who appeared with the respect of the dharma of mantra, Shingon, and stands atop a snake of about 3 meters long.
It is said that it appeared at the time of a religious ceremony to pray for rainfall held by Kukai at Shinsen-en.
Zennyo Ryuo came flying to Shoryu-ji Temple (Qinglongsi Temple) in China, where Mikkyo was guarded, and became a guardian goddess of the temple, 'Seiryu.'
In later years, when Kobo-daishi Kukai visited Seiryu-ji Temple and learned Buddhism, he begged to be given Samaya-vrata but it was not permitted.
When Kukai came back to Japan, it appeared in a ship and Kukai swore to guard Mikkyo, so that it was transferred by praying at the foot of Mt. Takao-san in Rakusai, Kyoto.
At that time it crossed the sea so that it came to be called 'Seiryu Gongen (清瀧権現)' with respect in Japan, adding the left-hand radical of 'Sanzui (sense of water)' to the Chinese character, 龍 (dragon).
Accordingly, the name of the river at the foot of Mt. Takao-san was changed to Kiyotaki (清滝）.
Moreover, Eun was invited to pray when transferring it to Ansho-ji Temple.
After Seiryu Gongen came flying to Japan and visited various temples, it descended to the peak of Daigo-ji Temple, in the present place, in around 900 by the invocations of Shobo.
Subsequently it became the goddess that guarded Shingon Mikkyo, which has been transmitted in that temple.
In 1097, Shokaku separated Daigo-ji Temple into the upper and lower parts of the mountain, so that in 'Kami-Daigo (the upper part of Daigo),' where Seiryu Gongen is said to have descended; at the front of the Daigo-sui spring stands 'Seiryu-gu Haiden,' a national treasure, which was built during the Muromachi period, and in 'Shimo-Daigo (the lower part of Daigo),' which is at the foot of Mt. Daigo-san, stands 'Seiryu-gu Honden,' a national important cultural property.
According to Buddhism and Hinduism, Enma is the master of Hell.
He is also considered to be a deity.
It is believed that Enma, being the king of a permanent dreamland, has the authority to judge the crimes committed by the dead while in life.
Enma is a transliteration of Yama in Sanskrit and Pali.
He is also called Yama-rāja (rāja means "king").
The transliteration is Enmaraja, and the free translation is Enma Daio (great king Enma).
His name is abbreviated as Enra, Enra-o, En-o or En.
Yama (Emma) is translated into Japanese as baku (縛), sosei (雙世), soo (雙王), seisoku (静息), shasei (遮正) or byodo(平等), etc.
Such Japanese translations are derived from the respective meaning of Chinese character, namely "Baku (縛)," which means capturing criminals, "sosei (雙世)," which means always suffering the consequences of pain and joy; "soo (雙王)," which means a king consisting of a paired brother and sister, and "byodo (平等)," which means the fair judgment of criminals.
Faith in various regions
He was a deity that originated in the era when India and Persia were unified; he has the common origin with saintly king Yima of Avesta.
According to the "Rig-Veda," Yama is considered to be the human ancestor because the human race was born of Yama and his sister Yami; he became the king of the world of the dead because he was the first human being to die.
He is believed to live in the deepest recesses of emptiness.
In ancient India, those who performed benefactions in life were believed to go to Yama's country out in heaven.
Sometimes he was identified with "death," but generally he was perceived as the king of the paradise of the dead or the deity that dominates ancestors residing in the universe after death.
Later, it was believed that he wore yellow vesture and a wreath on his head, held a rope for arrest, bound the soul of the dead with this rope and brought them to the place where he resided.
Further, he became being perceived as a dreadful deity who dominated the lower world, judged the dead and threw them into Hell; eventually, he became a being depicted simply as Death.
He is accompanied by 'Turdak,' the devil of deadly disease, who has the form of a skeleton.
In contemporary India he is depicted as the one who has blue skin and is riding on a buffalo (although his skin is black-colored in nature, he is depicted as blue-colored due to the artistic style).
It is generally believed that he was incorporated into Buddhism later and was deemed to be the king of Hell.
However, one theory holds that the same deity, Yama of Rig-Veda, diverged into two genealogies.
These two genealogies are as follows;
One went to a black world in a lower realm and became the king of Hell.
This section describes Enma.
The other went to a bright world in an upper realm and became Yamaten, the third heaven of the six heavens in the realm of desire in Buddhist cosmology, or Enmaten.
However, some people believe these two were basically unrelated but might have been confused because 閻魔 (Enma) is Yama while 夜摩・焔摩 (Yama/Enma) is Yaama or Yaamaa.
China
After he was introduced in China, he became amalgamated with Taizanfukun (Taishanfuzhun), who were associated with the Taoist philosophy of a permanent dreamland.
Eventually, he was linked to the faith of Juo (Ten Kings) by the bogus sutra called "Enra-o-juki Shishu Gyakushu Shoshichiojo Jodo-kyo Sutra" (abbreviated as "Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra, Yuxiu Shiwang Shengdijing Sutra"), which was compiled in the era of the late Tang dynasty and became the object of faith as one of the judges of Hell, whose role was to judge persons after death.
His well-known figure, clothed in the familiar vestments of a Tang official, was established at that time.
Japan
Regarding Japanese Buddhism, Jizo Bosatsu, which was later deemed to be the honji (substance) of Enma, had been introduced in the Nara period through "Jizojurin-kyo Sutra."
However, it did not become widespread under the social situation in which worldly interest was prioritized.
In the early Heian period when Mappo-shiso (the "end of the world" belief) prevailed, it was expounded by the monk Genshin and others to the nobility in the early Heian period and then widely to ordinary people in the late Heian period, and early in the early Kamakura period, "Jizo Bosatsu Hosshin Innen Juo-kyo Sutra" ("Jizojuo-kyo" for short), which was also a bogus sutra, was created based on Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra (Yuxiu Shiwang Shengqijing).
Thanks to the above, the theory that Jizo Bosatsu was the honji of Enma (although it is conceivable that the theory claiming that 'Jizo is Enma Daimao (Great Satan)') was derived from this fact, although the details aren't known; however, not only did faith in Jizo spread but faith in Juo did as well.
Enma is believed to be able to travel back and forth between Hell and the Pure Land.
As previously mentioned, Enmaten, one of the Juniten (twelve deities), is said to have the same origins as Enma.
While Enmaten was amalgamated with Enma-daio in China, the two were separately introduced into Japan, which might be the reason that the same was split into two.
When scolding a child who has told a lie, there is a folk tradition in Japan to say, 'I will ask Enma to yank out your tongue.'
Saiho-ji Temple Enma-do (official name is 'Gappo-ga-tsuji Enma-do Saiho-ji Temple') located in Naniwa Ward, Osaka City enshrines Enma.
It is said that the temple was built by Prince Shotoku and is the scene of 'Sesshu Gappo-ga-tsuji' (in Joruri (Japanese-type puppet play)).
The Gochi Nyorai, also known as Godai Nyorai, are five nyorai (tathagatas) associated with the five wisdoms of esoteric Buddhism (wisdom of the essence of the Dharma-realm, great perfect mirror wisdom, wisdom of equality, wisdom of wondrous observation, wisdom of accomplishing that which is to be done).
They are the Kongokai Gobutsu (Five Buddhas of the Diamond Realm).
Renowned depictions include statues at the lecture hall of To-ji Temple (Kyoo Gokoku-ji Temple) and Kyoto's Ansho-ji Temple.

According to Buddhism, Kechimyaku Sojo means the handing down of law (dharma) from a mentor to a disciple.
Nichiren, who was the founder of the sect, declared himself to be the reincarnation of Jogyo Bosatsu, who was directly bestowed Kecchofuzoku based on No. 21 of Nyoraijinrikihon of "Myohorenge-kyo" (Annex of "Mannen Kugo-honzon of December, 1274").
There are many other authorities.
Additionally, he asserted that he received Shingon Mikkyo's 'twenty-third chakuchaku (legitimate) sojo, as extended from Dainichinyorai to Nichiren' (from "Fudo Aizen Kankenki," a posthumous writing by Nichiren).
According to the description of "Risho-in Kechimyaku" of Daigo-ji Temple (collection of Kanazawa-Bunko), the name "Nichiren" appears twenty-fifth, and this position coincides with the name at the twenty-third position from Dainichinyorai; however, it is not clear whether "Nichiren" in "Risho-in Kechimyaku" and the founder are one and the same.
Since then, the sole inheritor of Kechimyaku Sojo has asserted the legitimacy of Nichiren Shoshu sect, and this position has been passed from the incumbent Hossu (chief priest) to his successor; the position itself guarantees absolute authority in controlling propagation activities, as well as the exclusive power to adjudicate on disputes concerning doctrine, to give permission for depicting the principal icon of a temple, and to bestow various titles.
Kechimyaku Sojo is often mystified by saying, for example, 'various elements that cannot be captured as objects (such as the attitude for faith, spirituality and accumulation of pious acts, etc.) are inherited by golden paper or through oral transmission.'
On the other hand, there is a simple understanding of Kechimyaku Sojo that its most essential core element exists only in the transfer of 'Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon' (principal image of the Nichiren Shoshu sect).
Depending on the times and circumstances, Kechimyaku Sojo could be done in the form of confidential affairs whose dissemination to the public would not be expected for some time to come.
It is said that in the past, Sojo from the third (Nichimoku) to the 4th (Nichido) and from the sixty-sixth (Nichidatsu) to the sixty-seventh (Nikken) was done in the form of confidential affairs, but some deny that regarding the case of Sojo to Nikken.
The Nichiren Shoshu sect asserts that only the chief priests of Taiseki-ji Temple inherited after Nichiren-Nikko-Nichimoku.
However, the Nichiren sect rebuffs the assertion of the Nichiren Shoshu sect on the following grounds:
If the assertion of the Nichiren Shoshu sect is true, it means that out of six old monks who were the disciples of the founder, five old monks who became anti Nikko were persons who had defamed the law (dharma); the question remains as to why the founder could not have predicted their behavior and acknowledged them as disciples.
Nika (two) Sojo, which consisted of two notes, 'Ikegami Sojo-sho' and 'Minobu Sojo-sho,' on which the Nichiren Shoshu sect's assertion is based, is bogus because it does not appear in the early record of Komon-ryu school.
Minobu Sojo is bogus because its date and the activities of Nichiren don't coincide.
Nika Sojo cannot even be the subject of discussion because it was stored at Omosu-dansho (an institute established in Omosu for the purpose of educating disciples; currently Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple), where Nikko lived after retirement, not at Taiseki-ji Temple which Nikko had ceded to Nichimoku, and because its original document is now missing.
As for the whereabouts of Nika Sojo, there are various assessments.
One view holds that it was completely lost due to looting by the army of Katsuyori TAKEDA.
The other view holds that it was not lost because there is a record that Ieyasu TOKUGAWA read the original copy and Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple is in fact storing it in confidence.
Traditionally, Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple has given little consideration to Kechimyaku Sojo.
From the very beginning, Nichidai, who was ceded Omosu by Nikko, was expelled by the people adherent to Omosu.
Naturally, the temple did not approve the transfer of Kechimyaku Sojo from Nikko to Nichimoku.
Currently, it even denies Nika Sojo and strives solely to preserve the status of the 'head temple of the Nichiren-shu sect.'
Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple did not approve Kechimyaku Sojo from Nikko to Nichimoku but instead split away, claiming the legitimacy of Nichidai based on "Hattsu Yuzurijo (eight notes that document the will to transfer the property or possession to the offspring or disciples)."
Hota Myohon-ji Temple and Koizumi Kuon-ji Temple did not approve Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichimoku to Nichido but instead split off, claiming the legitimacy of Nichigo.
They once came under the jurisdiction of Taiseki-ji Temple in 1957 but became independent again in the Heisei period after seeing the conflict between Soka Gakkai and the sect.
During the era of Nichizon, its original chief priest (of Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple) acknowledged Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichimoku to Nichido, and during the Edo period it turned out nine consecutive hossu as being the most overriding branch temple of Taiseki-ji Temple.
However, over the years it gradually became independent and dissolved the affiliation with Taiseki-ji Temple by denying Kechimyaku Sojo.
Currently, it is independent as the head temple of the 'Nichiren Honshu sect.'
Soon after the expulsion of five monks in 1980, Shoshin-kai filed court litigation requesting a confirmation of the non-existence of the position of the chief abbot (superintendent priest) on the grounds that Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichidatsu to Nikken doesn't appear to have been done, and that consequently the chief abbot in question lacked qualification.
Since then, it has continued to deny Kechimyaku Sojo in various respects, doing so as ammunition for attacking the Nikken and Nichiren Shoshu sects.
The litigation itself was dismissed on the grounds that the subject matter cannot be the subject of litigation because, like the problem of temple occupation, it is a matter of faith.
(A well-known judicial precedent concerning the legal theory of a partial society)
Recently, some monks have remarked that Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichidatsu to Nikken was done.
According to them, Kechimyaku Sojo was in fact performed but they had pretended otherwise as it provided ammunition for attack.
Since the excommunication in 1991, Soka Gakkai has asserted that Kechimyaku Sojo ended long ago.
After the headquarters instruction meeting held on April 12, 1999, Fuji Taiseki-ji Kensho-kai asserts, in the form of echoing the assertion of Shoshin-kai, that Nichidatsu could not bestow Kechimyaku Sojo to anyone because he had died suddenly as a consequence of Buddha's penalty relating to the change of doctrine.
It further asserts that Nikken assumed the position of Hossu by pretending that he had been bestowed Kechimyaku Sojo, even though it had not occurred.
Koen OTANI (February 27, 1875 - February 6, 1943) was a Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) monk who was the 23rd Hossu (head priest) of the Otani School of the Jodo Shinshu.

Koen OTANI studied traditional Japanese painting under Bairei KONO and Seiho TAKEUCHI, was influenced by Shiki MASAOKA and commented on in the magazine "Hototogisu" by Hekigoto KAWAHIGASHI and Kyoshi TAKAHAMA who he admired and looked up to.
He later broke from the influence of "Hototogisu" and followed his own path.
During his lifetime, he wrote many haiku poems (approximately 20,000) and used his poetic talent to forge his own reputation within the haiku world.
He is affectionately known as Kubutsu Shonin (meaning 'one who uses haiku poetry to praise Buddha').

Originally, Gozu Tenno (gośīrşa) was an Indian deity and the guardian deity of Gion-shoja (the Jetavana monastery).
Later on, he amalgamated with the Japanese deity Susanoo.
When the term "Tenno" alone is used, it usually means Gozu Tenno.
Although he has the horns of ox on his head and looks like Yasha (a class of semi-divine being usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified with malignant spirits), his figure resembles that of a human being.
As mentioned above, he is perceived as the guardian deity of Gion-shoja but he also is perceived as the suijaku (trace manifestation) of Yakushi-nyorai of Joruri-sekai (the realm known as Joruri or Pure Lapis Lazuli in the eastern quarter, Sk: Vaiduryanirbhasa).
He is also said to be a deity stemming from Ox-head Mountain of Shiragi (the Silla dynasty).
According to the extant "Bingonokuni Fudoki (ancient records of culture and geography of Bingo Province)" included in "Shaku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japanese History)," he was a prince of Buto Tenjin, his name was written as Gozu Tenno, he married a daughter of Shakara Ryuo, one of the Hachidai Ryuo (Eight Dragons) and he had eight princes.
In Japan, he amalgamated with Susanoo as he was a deity of ferocious nature and was enshrined at Yasaka-jinja Shrine in Gion, Kyoto and was worshiped as Joeki-shin (a god that protects against plague).
He is said to be a deity who has concurrently the aspect of Yakubyo-gami (a deity of the transmission of epidemics).
It is said that although he spreads diseases, he bestows remedies for all diseases on farmers who welcome him kindly.
During the Heian period, people in urban areas started to worship him and he became the object of worship in Gion Goryo-e (the Gion Matsuri Festival).
The faith for Gozu Tenno and Susanoo, which is the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism, is called Gion veneration, which had spread nationwide by the Medieval period.
He was enshrined at Hiromine-jinja Shrine, Yasaka-jinja Shrine, Tsushima-jinja Shrine, Hikawa-jinja Shrine and their branch shrines, but subsequent to the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the Meiji period, these shrines have became shrines to Susanoo.
However, in Nara, Kyoto and Niigata prefectures and others nationwide, there still are several shrines, including Tenno-jinja Shrine, that enshrine Gozu Tenno.
Many of the place names that include the word 'Tenno,' such as 'Tennoz Isle,' are derived from Gozu Tenno.
Once upon a time, Gozu Tenno went on a journey in the disguise of an old man and asked for lodging at a certain village.
On this occasion Kotanshorai, the wealthy younger brother, treated Gozu Tenno coldly, but the elder brother, Sominshorai, despite being poor, welcomed and entertained Gozu Tenno kindly.
Then, Gozu Tenno disclosed his identity and declared, 'In the near future, mortal disease will run rampant in this village, but I will save your family members.'
As predicted by him, when mortal disease rampaged the village, all the family members of Kotanshorai died but those of Sominshorai survived.
Even today, Yasaka-jinja Shrine and other shrines distributes red paper cards with "Sominshorai shison-no-mon" written on them in gold-colored characters, and the origin of this practice is the historical event mentioned above.
The reason for having gold-colored characters on red paper is that, according to Onmyo-do (the way of yin and yang), it is believed that 'these colors are what Yakubyo-gami detests.'
Kujaku Myoo is an object of worship in Buddhism and one of the Myoo (king of wisdom) having venerable status specific to Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism).
She is believed to represent the dharma of benefit to living things.
Originally, she was Mahamayuri, an Indian goddess, and one of the Pancharakshya (five protector deities).
Sanskrit name Mahamayuri means 'great peacock.'
She is also called Makamayuri, Kujaku Butsumo, Kujaku Omo Bosatsu or Konjiki kujaku-o.
Although the characteristic of Myoo is a fierce facial expression, she has only a Bosatsu-style face expressing mercy.
Usually, she is depicted as the one that is riding a peacock and has one face and four arms.
The four hands are holding Guen-ka, Kichijo-ka (auspicious fruit), lotus and a peacock's tail, respectively.
There are some images, such as the painting image at Ninna-ji Temple in Kyoto (the Northern Song Dynasty period, a national treasure), that have three faces and six arms.
Because a peacock eats bugs and poisonous snakes like cobra, Kujaku Myoo was believed to do the 'pious act of removing plague or pain from people' and therefore became an object of faith.
Later on, the interpretation that Kujaku Myoo performs the pious act of accomplishing Buddhism by eating poisonous living matter, in other words by eating the three kleshas that poison the heart of man (desire, ill will and ignorance), which symbolize the bonno (earthly desires) of human beings that had become prevalent; there are many sects that chant Shingon (mantra) of Kujaku Myoo at the rite as a charm against evil spirits.
Further, it was believed to have the ability to predict rainfall and was therefore used on certain occasions as a ritual for rain.
The incantation of Mikkyo that uses Kujaku Myoo as the principal image is called Kujakukyoho.
In the world of Shingon Mikkyo, the prayer of Kujakukyoho was emphasized the most as it was deemed to be a prayer to guard the nation.
Sutra: Daikujaku-myoo-kyo Sutra (Butsubo-daikujaku-myoo-kyo Sutra) and Daikujaku-myoo Gazodanjojiki
In Japan there is a record stating that she was worshiped during the Nara period, and her image was placed at the newly constructed Saidai-ji Temple Kondo (Saidai-ji Temple Golden Hall).

Jocho (D.O.B. unknown - died September 2, 1057) was a sculptor active in the latter part of the Heian period and is said to be the sculptor who perfected the technique called yoseki-zukuri, in which the main part of a statue is made out of two or more pieces of wood.
Son of the sculptor Kosho.
The shallow sculpting of the drapery with folds arranged in parallel lines, and the serene expressions of Jocho's simple and graceful Buddhist statues suited the preferences of the Heian aristocracy and this style was called 'Buddhist Style.'
According to historical accounts there is much evidence of his work however the only statue in existence that can be identified with certainty as his work is the wooden seated Amida Nyorai Statue (a national treasure), the principal object of reverence at Byodoin (Kyoto).
While examples of work in the Jocho style of sculpture came to be formalized, this Amida statue is a superb work which is highly acclaimed as a representative work of Jocho.
Buddhist statues ascribed to Jocho remain in existence around the country.
There is also a sculpture of a Jizo Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) in a temple in Wakayama Prefecture which is ascribed to Jocho.
According to Buddhism, Komokuten (viruupaakSa in Sanskrit) is the Buddha of Tenbu (deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another).
It is one of the Shitenno (the Four Guardian Kings) together with Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra), Zochoten (Virudhaka) and Tamonten (Vaisravana).
Although original meaning of Virupaksa in Sanskrit was 'the one who has various eyes' or 'the one who has awkward eyes,' such meaning was stretched to 'extraordinary eyes that have particular abilities' and was eventually interpreted as second sight and translated as "komoku (wide eyes)."
His sanmayagyo (symbol) is a sankogeki (a long, three-pronged spear) and kenjaku (a rope made from five different colored strands--blue, yellow, red, black and white--with clasps at both ends).
Shushi (Esoteric Buddhism) is vi.
His figure is depicted in various ways, but in Japan he is generally depicted as a leather-armored warrior of the Tan Dynasty period.
In the old days he was depicted as a figure writing something on a scroll with a brush.
However, most of such figures were created in the Tenpyo period, and since Heian period figures holding items other than the above gradually became more prevalent.
For example, in the Garbha-mandala of Mikkyo he is depicted as having a red-colored body, with right hand holding Sankogeki (a three-pronged pike) and the left hand clenched and placed on the right side of the waist.
Sometimes he is depicted as a figure holding kenjaku.
In Chinese folk belief he is depicted as a figure with a red-colored face and holding a dragon.
Originally, he served under the thunder god Indra (Taishakuten), who appears in Indian mythology, but later he was introduced in Buddhism as a guardian deity.
As one of the Shitenno that guard the four sides of Mt. Shumisen、which support the world where Buddha resides, he resides in Hakuginta and was believed to guard its west side or Saigokeshu, one of four continents on the earth believed to exist in the ancient Indian view of the world.
He has fierce gods such as Naga and Pishaca as subordinates.
The term Sohei means samurai (warriors) with the appearance of priests who were active from the Medieval Period until the early modern ages.
Summary
Hoshi-musha or armed priests were called Soshu or Akuso in the era when they were active but since the Edo period, they have been called "Sohei."
Incidentally, the Chinese character of "悪(aku)" used for the term of 悪僧 (Akuso), like 悪 (aku) used for 悪党 (akuto) means "strong."
They basically belonged to temples as armed groups.
Their figures were depicted in picture scrolls and their characteristics were cloth covering heads, Takageta (tall wooden clogs) and Naginata (halberd).
It is highly possible that they didn't shave their heads.
In the meantime, armed groups belonging to shrines were called Jinin.
As there were Buddhist priests' groups outside of Japan that organized priests into armed groups, such as Suzan Shorin-ji Temple (Mountain Sung Shaolin Temple), the term Sohei sometimes refers to such armed religious groups in broad terms.
When used in this sense, the Military Order in Europe is also included in the category of Sohei.
During the era when Sohei or Jinin were active, temples and shrines were rich due to holding vast Jiryo (landownership of Buddhist Temples) or Shrine Estates amidst the unstable society and they faced risks of being assailed by various social groups, including groups of robbers.
For this reason, the need to have military power for defending temples and shrines from such attacks arose.
In this historic context, 'arming of temples and shrines,' although it seemingly sounds contradictory, was in fact promoted.
Historically, Daishu (Doshu), those who belonged to big temples in Kyoto and Nara City and were engaged in odd jobs, and armed themselves for self-defense and became Sohei.
During the late Heian period, Sohei became powerful armed groups with their stronghold including at Kofuku-ji Temple, Enryaku-ji Temple, Onjo-ji Temple and Todai-ji Temple and were repeatedly involved in power struggles among temples or in acts of menace to the imperial court and Sekke (line of regents and advisers).
In Mochihito-o War, Sohei also fought against the Taira family.
Such a fight against the Taira family is depicted in "Heike Monogatari" (The Tale of the Taira family).
Sohei belonging to Kofuku-ji Temple (Nanto, southern capital) and Enryaku-ji Temple (Hokurei) were specifically called Shuto (Nara-hoshi) and Yama-hoshi respectively.
Emperor Shirakawa cited 'water of the Kamo River (flow of Kamo-gawa River), cast of sugoroku and Yama-hoshi (Mt. Hiei)' as being beyond his control and from this anecdote, it can be guessed that the high-handedness of the Sohei was a worry for the imperial court.
Even in regions far from the center of Japan, some dominant temples and shrines exerted a big influence on the power balance in those days with holding military power or by joining forces with the local militia.
It is well- known that during Jisho-Juei War, both sides made political deals with Kumano Gongen Deity that presided over Kumano Suigun Navy.
In the Muromachi period, Yoshinori ASHIKAGA, who was formerly known by Gien and had once been a temple head priest of the Tendai sect, was familiar with the military power and high-handedness of Sohei to conduct massive military operations in order to crack down on Enryaku-ji Temple (Nobunaga conducted similar operations later).
After that, such trend of those dominant temples and shrines in various regions to hold military power continued.
The following are examples of powerful Sohei groups during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
Kofuku-ji Temple; Inei, the founder of the Hozoin school of Sojutsu (the art of the spearman ship), was well-known.
Negoro-ji Temple; it was well-known for its mighty harquebus corps including Kazunaga TSUDA, the founder of Tsuda school of gunnery.
It was subdued by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI by his expedition to Kishu and lost military power.
Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple; it boasted overwhelming influential power as well as military power through Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers) which was fought by, instead of its own Sohei group, believers called up from every region of the country (many of them were indigenous persons and ordinary people), but eventually it suffered devastating defeat in the Ishiyama War and lost its military power.
Suwa-taisha Shrine; it was subdued by Shingen TAKEDA and lost military power.
It was rebuilt as the line of the feudal lord but was split from that of the Shinto priest.
Usa-jingu Shrine; it was subdued by Yoshishige OTOMO and lost military power.
Since all temples and shrines mentioned above had either lost their military power or had been divided, their religious powers had been separated from the military powers by the Edo period.
Rinno-ji Temple on Mt. Nikko; it held many Sohei and was one of the leading armed groups in Shimotsuke Province.
Because it joined forces with the Gohojo clan, it was oppressed by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI to be forfeited its Jiryo, then declined.
Later, it recovered its clout under the protection of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA who had been transferred to Kanto.
Tanzan-jinja Shrine; it often clashed with Kofuku-ji Temple.
In 1585, it accepted the disarmament request made by Hidenaga TOYOTOMI when he came to Yamato Province and surrendered weapons.
Heisen-ji Temple Hakusan-jinja Shrine; as the branch temple of Enryaku-ji Temple, it held eight thousand Sohei and extended its power to Echizen Province.
In 1574, it was burnt down in the battle against Ikko Ikki.
It was declined thereafter.
However, by allying itself with Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI from early on, it recovered its Jiryo.
Rokudo is a Buddhist term and it means six posthumous worlds to which the souls of the dead transmigrate.
The six worlds that constitute Rokudo are as follows.
Jigoku-do (world of hells)
Gaki-do (world of hungry ghosts)
Chikusho-do (world of animals)
Shura-do (world of bellicose demons)
Ningen-do (world of humans)
Ten-do (world of heavenly beings) (also called Tenjo-do or Tenkai-do)
According to Buddhism, it is believed that stray lives that came in to the world will transmigrate after death to one of six posthumous world depending on the crimes they committed while alive and repeat life and death in each of the Rokudo where they transmigrated (Rokudo-rinne, Rebirth in the Six Worlds).
Even those transmigrated to Ten-do cannot escape from the rebirth of pain.
Based on the principle that all things are in flux and nothing is permanent, it is believed that lives are destined to die out eventually and transmigrate to another world (or the same world) regardless of the world to which they transmigrated.
Under the world view of Shumisen (Mt. Sumeru), the six worlds mentioned above are sometimes understood as space.
Those lives that deviated from the road of the wheel of life, such as Tengu (braggart), are commonly called Gedo (Maen).
In the picture depicting the wheel of life, such as the one shown in upper right,
monster and skeleton represent ignorance (Mumyo) and uncertainty regarding the root of the Twelve-fold Chain of Dependent Origination,
the outer circular ring represents human behavior (omen),
the second circular ring represents Rokudo (in this picture, heavenly beings, human beings and Ashura occupy the same place),
the inner circular ring represents human beings, and
the circle in the middle represents wrath (symbolized by snakes) that is the cause of pain, folly (pigs) that represents ignorance and greed (birds)
respectively.
In connection with Rokudo, the belief of afterlife that souls are saved from the world to which they transmigrated by the guidance of Kannon (Deity of Mercy), called Kannon belief, was generated and it was believed that six different Kannon bear respective roles.
These are called Roku Kannon (the six Kannon).
Tendai sect and Shingon sect adopt different interpretations concerning Ningen-do and Fukukensaku Kannon (Kannon of the Never Empty Lasso) and Jundei Kannon (Cundi) are adopted, respectively.
When called Shichi Kannon (the seven Kannon), these two Kannon are included.
Rokudo
Roku Kannon in Shingon sect
Roku Kannon in Tendai sect
Jigoku-do; Sho-Kannon (Sacred Kannon, or Aryavalokitesvara); Sho Kannon
Gaki-do; Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Kannon, or Thousand Armed Avalokiteshwara); Senju Kannon
Chikusho-do; Bato Kannon (horse-headed Kannon); Bato Kannon
Shura-do; Juichimen Kannon (Eleven-faced Kannon); Juichimen Kannon
Ningen-do; Jundei Kannon; Fukukensaku Kannon
Ten-do; Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion); Nyoirin Kannon
Nirvana, which means awakening to Buddha through Satori (enlightenment), can be achieved while in life, and is not necessarily triggered simply by death.
Nirvana is a fundamentally different notion from the phenomenon of posthumous transmigration and as represented by Shaka, human beings can live in the same world as before until their death even after awakening to Buddha since no special world is prepared for Buddha.
Compared with Rokudo, nirvana can be understood as a more psychological notion.
Historically, the pure land philosophy that is held by Jodo-kyo etc. was established long after the establishment of Rokudo-rinne philosophy.
The pure land is common with Rokudo in the sense of a place where the dead are destined to go, but it is a completely different notion from the world-view under the philosophy of Rokudo-rinne.
The pure land can be defined as the world where Buddha resides and is not limited to one of the Rokudo.
Ten-do
Ten-do is the world where Tenjin (heavenly beings) reside.
Tenjin are believed to have very long life-spans and be better and far less pain than human beings.
Tenjin are also believed to be able to fly in the sky and spend a life of pleasure.
But Tenjin are not relieved from Bonno (earthly desires).
When Tenjin are dying, it is believed that five changes occur.
These changes are called Gosui (Tenjin Gosui) and when such changes occur, they stink with their body being covered in grime, they sweat from the underarms, they become less fond of the place where they reside and flowers on their heads wither.
Ningen-do
Literally, Ningen-do is the world where Ningen (human beings) reside.
Although it is a world with so much pain, it is believed that pleasure may come after a succession of pain.
There is also relief that those can become a Buddha.
Shura-do
Shura-do is the world where Shura reside.
Shura are believed to fight and struggle all the time.
Although it is a world where pain and anger are constantly rampant, it is not a hellish place and pain can be largely attributed to oneself in this world.
Chikusho-do
Chikusho-do is the world where oxen and horses reside.
As oxen and horses live almost solely with instinct and are forced to work by human beings, they are unable to attain Buddha's teaching by themselves and in this sense, this world is believed to be of less relief.
Gaki-do
Gaki-do is the world where Gaki (preta) reside.
Gaki have the appearance of a demon with a bloated belly and they always suffer from hunger and thirst because food becomes ash when they are set to eat.
There is an example of a person who was thrown into this world because he didn't care for other people while in life..
Segaki-e (hungry ghosts' feeding rites) is held on July 15 of lunar calendar in order to save these Gaki.
Jigoku-do
Jigoku-do is the world for making human beings atone for crimes committed during their life.
Refer to Jigoku (Buddhism) for details.
Concerning the above six worlds, Jigoku, Gaki and Chikusho are sometimes collectively called San-akushu (literally, three bad realms, San-akudo, Sanaku or Sanzu) and Shura, Ningen and Ten are collectively called San-zenshu (literally, three good realms).
Jigoku, Gaki, Chikusho and Shura are sometimes collectively called Shi-akushu (literally, four good realms).
Further, Rokudo other than Shura are sometimes collectively called Goshu (literally, five realms).
Under early Buddhism, Jigoku, Gaki, Chikusho, Ningen and Ten were collectively called Goshu and Shura did not exist.
Therefore, Goshu is deemed as an older notion than Rokudo.
Originally, Shura (Ashura) was included in Tenbu (Deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another) but after Mahayana Buddhism was established, Shura derived from Tenbu and became Rokudo.
Therefore, these two notions are collectively called Five Realms Six Paths.
Rokudo originated from ancient Indian philosophy before the establishment of Buddhism and did not have a significant meaning in early Buddhism.
It is perceived that systematization proceeded at a later stage in history.
Although not originating from India or China, Roku Jizo (six Jizo Bodhisattva) which are allocated in each Rokudo, were enshrined throughout Japan in the 11th century and widely worshipped by ordinary people.
We will introduce two kinds of Shojin ryori here; one are Shojin ryori derived from Buddhism and the other are Shojin ryori that are categorized as one of Japanese cuisine.
Shojin ryori mean vegetarian diet which are prepared as the charity for monks using only vegetables, beans and grain since the five commandments of Buddhism prohibit monks from killing and under Mahayana Buddhism, even meat eating is prohibited.
Summary
Under early Buddhism in India, three kinds of pure meat, other than the ten kinds of meat that the commandments of Hinayana prohibited, were allowed to be eaten (called the 3 meats of Kenbungi).
In this case, monks were allowed to eat either the meat of animals if they had not seen the slaughter, meat of animals which they didn't know were slaughtered for them, or meat of animals with no suspicion of the above two case, and the production of dairy products was also allowed as Shaka attained enlightment while receiving the charity of chyle.
Currently, in countries with Theravada Buddhism, such as Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, Shojin ryori which vegetable is mainly served have not developed since monks are allowed to eat three kinds of pure meat (the notion of Shojin ryori itself exists).
On the other hand, Mahayana Buddhism prohibited meat eating itself later on and therefore, vegetarian dishes have developed in cultural areas of Buddhism including China and Japan.
In China and Tibet, however, use of eggs and dairy products are sometimes allowed and no clear standards exist.
(It seems to have been thought in Japan that drinking milk was equivalent to killing because milk is supposed to be drunk by calves)
Although there are some people among the believers of Hinduism and Jainism in India who eat only vegetables as a practice of ahimsa, the term of Shojin ryori is basically used in connection with Buddhism.
Characteristics
One of the characteristics of Shojin ryori is the necessity for time-consuming precooking such as removing harshness and boiling because precooking had been required for vegetables and beans until the practice of eating fresh vegetables as a la cart cuisine, namely salad, took root in Japanese food culture.
These complex cooking techniques and notion of foodstuffs exerted a large effect on many cooks, as well as cooking scholars, and contributed to the development of the overall field of cooking.
Further, as the cooking of Shojin ryori required use of simple foodstuffs under a lot of constraints, the necessity for various primary and secondary processing is also one of their characteristics.
Thanks to this background, together with the objective of long storage and not tiring people, fermented soybean paste, soy sauce, soybean curd, dried bean curd, soybean milk, natto (fermented soybean) and deep-fried bean curd were created.
These techniques were developed and accumulated by temples which required Shojin ryori, as well as by the nearby residents.
Another example is so-called 'Modoki' cuisine which is seen especially in China.
This is a cooking technique to make cuisine resemble animal-derived food with the use of vegetable origin materials.
For example, making ham-like food by processing dried bean curd (Chinese ham), shaping prawns or cuttlefish using konjac or making something like abalone soup or fried abalone using shiitake or other mushrooms.
Shojin ryori were indispensible food for monks, and taking meals was emphasized as part of ascetic training.
At the same time, Shojin ryori were also cooked by private citizens in homes or restaurants on ceremonial occasions or during the Bon festival.
Shojin ryori at restaurants are sometimes cooked with the aim of providing dainty food that is in contradiction to the Buddhist notion of a meal.
In China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, there are many restaurants and Japanese-style restaurants whose specialty is Shojin ryori.
Japanese Shojin ryori
It is believed that Shojin ryori already existed in Japan when Buddhism was introduced, but full-fledged development started in Kamakura period.
Especially, the introduction of the Zen sect during the Kamakura period contributed to the development of Shojin ryori.
Before the Heian period, Japanese cuisine, although using fish and birds as ingredients, did not have much taste and required after-cooking seasoning to eat and in this sense, it was undeveloped cuisine.
On the contrary, Shojin ryori of the Zen sect, although their ingredients were vegetable in origin, had strong taste and warriors and ordinary people who had to drive themselves and needed to take supplemental salt, were satisfied with such strong tastes.
Seasoning, cooking devices and cooking techniques used for Shojin ryori, like fermented soybean paste, earthenware mortar and Nishime (traditional Japanese stewed meal) with root vegetables, were introduced into Japanese cuisine.
Foodstuffs like been curd, freeze-dried bean curd, konjac and Hama-natto (Shiokara-natto) are thought to have been introduced as indispensible foodstuffs for Shojin ryori.
Under the Soto sect in Zen sect, cooking and the taking of meals is especially emphasized because of the anecdote that when Dogen, its founder, went to Sung (Dynasty) to study Buddhism and met with the temple chef of Mt. Aikuo, he learned of their daily activities, including cooking and taking of meals, which represent the substance of Bendo ascetic training.
After returning from Sung, Dogen wrote "Tenzo Kyokun" (Instructions for the Monastery Chief Cook) and "Fushukuhanpo" (The Dharma for Taking Food) which are said to be the origin of Shojin ryori of the Eihei-ji Temple school.
At Eihei-ji Temple, preparing meals is one important part of ascetic training and Tenza, a chef responsible for Kuin (Kitchen), is a member of the senior monks.
In the Edo period, the Obaku sect, one of the Zen sect, was introduced from China following the decline of the Ming Dynasty.
Chinese-style Shojin ryori were then introduced (so-called Sosai) and are called Fucha-ryori cuisine.
A unique style of eating, namely four persons sit around a table (rectangular table) and share food served on big plates, dish by dish, and was regarded as a curiosity.
Many Chinese-style dishes, such as sauted vegetables called 'Unpen,' Goma-dofu (crushed sesame seeds boiled in water and chilled like tofu) and 'Modoki' cuisine (Kabayaki of yamaimo (Japanese yam)), are found in the category of Fucha ryori cuisine.
As sesame oil was used in Chinese-style cooking techniques, such as sauteing and frying, the use of oil in cooking which had not been prevalent in Japan, was promoted.
As "Fucha" means " diffusing tea," Fucha ryori cuisine contributed to diffuse Sencha (natural leaf tea).
Fucha ryori cuisine was enjoyed not only by monks at temples of the Obaku sect, but also by civilians, especially intellectual people, and was served at restaurants as a means of savoring exoticism, rather than Shojin ryori.
With the reciprocal effects of Shippoku cuisine (a delectable melange of Western, Chinese and Japanese cuisine)from Nagasaki, Fucha ryori cuisine in civilian society often used tablecloths, vitreous wine glasses and decanters that were precious at the time, and also other western tableware.
In the Edo period, a book that specialized in the cooking of Fucha ryori cuisine, "Fucha-ryori-sho," was published.
Although it was gradually Japanized, Fucha ryori cuisine was brilliant and lively compared with traditional Shojin ryori and contemporary Fucha ryori cuisine has developed to be unique, and one that has brilliant appearance.
In the Edo period, there were many restaurants that supplied Fucha ryori cuisine to temples as outside contractors or which cooked for writers and artists, with no relationship to Buddhist activities.
Shojin ryori of Daitoku-ji Temple, Kyoto, are examples of the former, and those of Hida Takayama are examples of the latter and both have created artistic dishes which are different from those of temples by reintroducing the technique of Kaiseki ryori (tea-ceremony dishes) that had been split off.
As described above, Shojin ryori exerted effects on Japanese cuisine and contributed to its development.
Shojin ryori of Eihei-ji Temple school are considered to be the origin of Honzen-ryori cuisine, which prevailed from the Muromachi period to the early Edo period.
Kaiseki ryori are also derived from Shojin ryori.
Although contemporary Kaiseki ryori (sometimes confused with Kaiseki cuisine (dishes served on an individual tray for entertaining guests) because of the same pronunciation in Japanese) is luxurious, the original one was plain, and used seasonable materials and adopted the spirit of Shojin ryori.
Fucha ryori cuisine was imported from China, although the cooking techniques of Chinese cuisine was Japanized, and food such as Kenchin-jiru soup, Noppei-jiru soup and simmered, sauted or fried food using powdered arrowroot became prevalent.
Other than the above, there is a practice of Tenshin (Chinese dumpling).
This practice was introduced from China during the Muromachi period and under this practice, buns with bean-jam filling, Yokan (sweet bean jelly), Udon (Japanese wheat noodles) and/or Japanese vermicelli were served.
Although this practice was originally prevalent only among nobilities and warriors, it diffused among ordinary people in the course of time and became the origin of the current practice of lunch.
Shojin ryori in contemporary Japan
There are quite a few Buddhist temples that lodge worshippers in the Shukubo (priest's quarters) and provide Shojin ryori with the aim of having them experience a part of the ascetic training of Buddhism.
There are many such temples among those belonging to the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect since worshipping is deemed to constitute the important part of faith under the doctrine of these sects.
Some Shukubo provide meals and lodging only.
There are many Shukubo at Zenko-ji Temple in Nagano Prefecture which lodge worshippers and many of them provide Shojin ryori for dinner.
Shojin ryori provided by these Shukubo vary from authentic ones, such as Honzen type cuisine, to modern ones similar to Kaiseki ryori (tea-ceremony cuisine).
On the other hand, many temples in Kyoto relied on outside restaurants for preparing Shojin ryori for important guests and as a result, advanced Shojin ryori are available at such nearby restaurants rather than at the temples.
Around Daitoku-ji Temple, there are some well-established restaurants that specialize in Shojin ryori.
The above is also applicable to Fucha ryori cuisine and there are many restaurants which serve Fucha ryori cuisine around Manpuku-ji Temple, the head temple of the Obaku sect.
Varieties of Fucha ryori cuisine range from the ones which are prepared at restaurants in the style of Kaiseki ryori (tea-ceremony cuisine), and are quite similar to Japanese cuisine, to the ones which are close to the original ones prepared at Zen temples in Nagasaki or the ones which are quite similar to Chinese cuisine that adopt contemporary Sosai (the fact that there are many ethnic Chinese among supporters of Zen temples in Nagasaki and they receive many visitors from China and Taiwan during the Obon festival, could be the background).
Kangiten (or Nandikesvara) (Ganapati in Sanskrit) is one of the tenbu, guardian deities that reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another, in Buddhism.
It is also called Daisho Kangi-jizaiten or Shoten.
Incidentally, 'Shoten' is often pronounced 'Shoden.'
It is depicted as a figure in which a man and a woman who have elephant heads and human bodies embrace one another.
It corresponds to Ganesa, Vinayaka or Nandikesvara in Sanskrit.
It was a child of Shiva in ancient India, and was originally a violent and evil god.
Regarding Ganesa in Hinduism, see the article, 'Ganesa.'
After it came to believe Buddhism, it became Goho Zenshin, a good deity protecting dharma (護法善神) and guarded Sanzen Sekai (the universe) and the three treasures of Buddha, Buddhism and priests at the head of 9,800 fierce gods.
From the perspective of Buddhism, a man of Kangiten was the first son of Daijizaiten (Mahesvara) and a fierce god who violated world, and was called 'Jozui-ma (常隋魔).' who always peered into people's emptiness.
A woman of Kangiten, who was an avatar of Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Bodhisattva), embraced a man and quelled his violation by invoking his feeling of enjoyment.
Many statues of Kangiten, which have elephant heads and human bodies with long elephant trunks, are expressed in Japan as a figure in which a man and a woman embrace each other face to face.
There are works that have only one body or those that have many arms (four or six), but they are rare.
The origin of the statue of a man and woman embracing is that Juichimen Kannon (Kannon with eleven faces) changed its figure to a heavenly maiden in order to quell the desire of Kangiten, who was originally a fierce god, and embraced him.
Because of this character of the statue, Kangiten is a Buddhist statue not usually shown to the public.
In Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) it is regarded as the principal image of Kangiten-ho (歓喜天法) （Shoten-ho (聖天法）), who prays for pious acts, but it is generally worshipped as a god of marital harmony and the blessing of a child.
Many statues of Kangiten are small statues placed in zushi, miniature shrines in which Buddhist images or rolls of sutras (kyo), are kept; they are made of metal because a mass is held by Yokuyu-ho (浴油法), placing it in oil.
The statue of Kangiten at Hokai-ji Temple in Kamakura City is a wooden statue over 150 cm tall and was beautifully made, so that it can be said to be a representative work among the Kangiten statues in Japan.
The mantra (shingon) is On Kiri (Ku) Gyaku Un Sowaka.
Although it is said that the first 'ku' (meaning "trouble" in Japanese) is often omitted in the sense of preventing trouble at the time of invocation, in Japan the part that is read as 'kiriku' is a corrupted form of the original sound, 'Furi-hi,' which is simply read as 'kiriku' in the Shingon sect and 'Kiri' in the Tendai sect.
Therefore, in the other Shingon litany there is a case in which the sound of 'Furi-hi' in Japan is pronounced like that, according to the particular sect.
Altarage
As the altar configuration for Kangiten, there is a candy called Kangi-dan or Kangi-gan.
It was a candy in India, but in Japan it means the altar configuration only for Kangiten and Bishamonten (Vaisravana).
There are various opinions on the ingredients and preparation, and it is said that there are 11 types such as honeydew, rum blossom and strawberry; there is also an opinion that there are different types according to the aims of prayers such as the defeat of evil (調伏) and for good health.
Currently, the method is to mix rice flour with water, roll into a flat rice cake, place red beans, dried persimmon and a medicinal material in it, and cook in oil.
Twist the edge so that it resembles the shape of a rum blossom.
It is placed with sake and Japanese radish as altar configuration in the Shoten-gu mass (Kangiten-gu mass).
The three main shotens in Japan
The three main shotens in Japan generally consist of the shotens of three temples, two of which are Honryu-inTemple (commonly called Matsuchiyama-Shoden) in the Taito Ward of Tokyo and Hozan-ji Temple (commonly called Ikoma-Shoten) in Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture; the third could be any one of Kangi-in Temple (commonly called Menuma-Shoden) in Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture; Ashigarasan Shoden-do Temple (commonly called Ashigara-Shoden) in Oyama-cho, Shizuoka Prefecture; Daifukuden-ji Temple (commonly called Kuwana-Seiten) in Kuwana City, Mie Prefecture; or Toraku-ji Temple (commonly called Toyooka-Shoten) in Toyooka City, Hyogo Prefecture.

Kuya or Koya (903 - September 11, 972) was a priest in the mid-Heian period.
He is called Amida-hijiri, Ichi-no-hijiri and Ichi-no-shonin, and is recognized as the founder of pure-land teachings (Jodo-kyo) among the people.
He became a priest at a provincial monastery in Owari Province.
Since his youth he had visited various provinces as a lay disciplinant, implemented social projects such as construction of roads, bridges and temples with reciting Myogo (Amida's name) of Namu Amidabutsu, and gathered followers widely without regard to their affluence or poverty.
In 938 he recommended Buddhist invocation in Kyoto.
In 948 he was given vows to follow the precepts by Ensho, the temple's head priest in Mt. Hiei-zan, but there is an opinion that he had a stronger relationship with Nara Buddhist society, particularly with the Sanron sect, as opposed to the Tendai sect.
In 951 he made some statues including Juichimen Kannon (Kannon with eleven faces) (which exists in Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple).
Additionally, he started to copy Kinji Dai-hannya-kyo Sutra in 950, and in 963 he held a mass for a large gathering of people on the shore of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system).
Through these activities he also deepened the relationship with aristocrats such as FUJIWARA no Saneyori.
He died at the age of 70 in Higashiyama Saiko-ji Temple (later Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple).
His disciples became pioneers of 'Nenbutsu-hijiri,' such as Koya-hijiri, who as practitioners of Jodo-kyo caused it to become widespread among the people after the medieval times, and this had a great influence on Ippen during the Kamakura period.
He is also admired as the founder of Odori Nenbutsu and Rokusai Nenbutsu (both of which mean "to recite Namu Amidabutsu while dancing"), but there is no evidence that Kuya himself practiced the so-called Odori-Nenbutsu.
According to "Kuya-rui," written by MINAMOTO no Tamenori, and "Nihon Ojo Gokuraku-ki," by YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane, there was a view that Kuya had descended from the Imperial Family (as an illegitimate child of the Emperor Daigo) during his life, but he did not voluntarily speak about his parents.
Rairyu SHIMOTSUMA (1552 - June 15, 1609) was a priest of the Otani family in the age of the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan).
He was a son of Shinrai SHIMOTSUMA and the father of Yorihiro SHIMOTSUMA (later Shigetoshi IKEDA, a lord of the Shingu-han domain (Harima Province).
It is said that he was familiar with politics and cultural affairs rather than military affairs among the priests of Hongwan-ji Temple's, and that he communicated with the merchants of Sakai through tea parties and so on.
In the Ishiyama War he gained fame on the battlefield against Akimoto HOSOKAWA, who was on Nobunaga ODA's side.
It is said that when Hongwan-ji Temple surrendered Nobunaga, he signed the peace treaty jointly.
However, when Kyonyo attempted to remain in Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple again the following year, Rairyu, who was an aide of Kyonyo, was scolded by Kennyo.
Later, he married a daughter of Tsuneoki IKEDA.
Ekei, of Ankoku-ji Temple, was a Zen priest and a Japanese feudal lord from the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan) to the Azuchi Momoyama period.
Ankoku-ji' is the name of the temple (Aki Province Ankoku-ji Temple Rishoto (Fudo-in)) of which he was the chief priest.
He was a diplomat priest of the Mori clan (a Zen priest who was in charge of negotiations for the warrior caste) and finally became a Japanese feudal lord while retaining his status as a priest.
There are various views on the year of his birth, so that some believe it was 1539 and others believe it was 1537.
There are also various views on his father, such as Nobushige TAKEDA of the Aki Takeda clan and Shigekiyo BAN, the husband of Motoshige TAKEDA's daughter of the same clan.
In 1541, when the Aki Takeda clan was subverted by the attack of Motonari MORI, he was led to safety by his followers and became a priest at the Ankoku-ji Temple (Fudo-in) in Aki Province.
Subsequently, he entered Tofuku-ji Temple in Kyoto and became a disciple of Jikuun Eshin.
As a priest he became the chief priest of Ankoku-ji Temple in Aki Province in 1574, and he also became the chief priest of Tofuku-ji Temple and Nanzen-ji Zen Temple, assuming the highest status among the central Zen temples.
In 1599 he made efforts to rebuild Kennin-ji Temple.
On the other hand, he became a diplomat priest of the Mori clan relatively early in life because the Mori clan had embraced Eshin, and succeeded in making peace with the Otomo clan in Bungo Province in 1570.
In 1582, while the Mori clan was encamped opposite Hideyoshi HASHIBA (Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI) at Takamatsu-jo Castle in Bichu Province (the Battle of Bichu Takamatsu-jo Castle), the Honno-ji Incident occurred and Nobunaga ODA was killed at Honno-ji Temple (the Honno-ji Incident).
At this time, Hideyoshi HASHIBA brought up the peace plan with respect to the Mori clan, but hid the fact, and Ekei, a diplomat priest, made up the peace plan.
He was regarded as having forecast Hideyoshi's future success and having willingly devised the peace plan, so that he gained the confidence of Hideyoshi.
He was praised by Hideyoshi because he was in charge of negotiations when the Mori clan formally entered service as a vassal of the Hideyoshi in January 1585.
For this reason he was given land of 23,000 goku in Iyo Province after the conquest of Shikoku, and was given land of 60,000 goku in Iyo Province after the conquest of Kyushu in 1586, so that he became an unusual Japanese feudal lord of the Toyotomi clan, retaining his status as a priest.
Moreover, he served Hideyoshi as an aide at the same time so that he was in charge as the bugyo (administrator) of land surveys and so on, as implemented at the order of Hideyoshi.
At the time of the Bunroku-Keicho War, he crossed the sea as a kenshi (inspector).
Among the Mori clan, Ekei was familiar to Takakage KOBAYAKAWA, who was the key figure in the pro-Hideyoshi group; however, after Takakage's death he was opposed to Hiroie KIKKAWA, a central figure in the Mori clan, just as the Kobayakawa clan was.
At the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he sided with the Western army through Mitsunari ISHIDA, who was familiar to him, and succeeded in making Terumoto MORI the commander in chief of the Western army.
At the Battle of Sekigahara on September 15 (old lunar calendar), he took up a line at the rear of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's force with Hidemoto MORI and Hiroie KIKKAWA, but he could not join the fight because Hiroie at the front line communicated with Ieyasu secretly and prevented Mori force's from participating in the battle.
After the defeat of the Western army, Ekei escaped but was captured by Nobumasa OKUDAIRA's military unit in Kyoto, and went to the guillotine as one of the leaders of the Western army at Rokujokawara (there is a view that the reason for his execution was that he brought the Mori clan into the Western army, though the Mori clan had not initially made clear its position as anti-Tokugawa).
He died at the age of 62.
He might also have been 64.
His kubizuka (a grave of his head) (首塚) lies in the garden of Kennin-ji Temple, and there is also a grave at Fudo-in Temple, in Hiroshima.
In the letter to Yamagata Echizen-no-kami (Lord of Echizen province) Harutada INOUE as of December 12, 1573, he wrote that 'Nobunaga's government will not continue for five or three years. He seems to become a court noble around next year. I think he will be subverted after that. Tokichiro (Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI) is really something.'
This letter has often been quoted as an anecdote to show Ekei's insight because he forecasted the downfall of Nobunaga ODA and the strong showing of his follower, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and as a result his expectations were proved to be correct.
The honzon (the principal object of worship) in Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism is the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon (usually called the Lotus Mandala).
Also known as the Honzon of Ichienbudaisoyo, it was drawn by Nichiren, the founding father of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, on a Japanese cinnamon tree and engraved by Izumi-ko Nipposhi.
It is characterized by the Nichiren mantra Namu Myohorenge-kyo at its center, with the Kao (a written seal) of Nichiren below it, prayers summoning various Buddhas surrounding it, images of the Four Guardians in its corners, and bonji (Sanskrit characters) for Fudo Myoo (god of wisdom and righteousness) and Aizen Myoo (god of love) on either side of it.
Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon has writings such as 'Honmonokaidan,' 'Ganshu Yashiro Kunishige' and 'Hokkekoshura Keihaku.'
Branch temples of Nichiren Shoshu enshrine a copy of the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon copied by the Hoshu as mandala Honzon, and followers receive a mandala, which is a copy of the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon copied by Taiseki-ji Temple priests (Hossu).
Nichiren Shoshu has decreed that the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon is said to be drawn by the founding father on October 12, 1279 as the Honzon of Kimyoeji, (enshrined in the Grand Head Temple, Taiseki-ji Temple Hoan-do) and considers it to be the true reason for the founding father's appearance.
The Great mandala Honzon based on the founding father's idea is sometimes called Monji mandala or Jikkai mandala by art lovers, but they are all branches and leaves of the tree trunk that is the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon.
The structure of the Honzon is with the opening phrase consisting of the Nichiren chant, 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' and the name of the shuso 'Nichiren' with hangyo (a seal) is written in unique, characteristic handwriting in the center as a column, with many names representing living things that are included in the Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind, starting from Shakamuni-butsu/Taho-nyorai on both sides, and Bodhisattva and gods, even to Devadatta in hell, surround it.
This image expresses, as Honzon Shichika no Sojo says, 'the opening in the center, Jikkai on either side, and all represent Nichiren,' and borrowing the image of a ceremony on the Ryozenejo, Jikkaigogu, Hyakkaisennyo, Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind are all expressed by Nichiren Dai-Shonin.
In other words, together with the central Namu Myohorenge-kyo and the Holy Entities of the Jikkai on both sides, it expresses the entire life of Nichiren Dai-Shonin
Therefore, the Dai-Shonin said 'Please believe in me because I poured my soul into the ink to write this.'
Each temple, facility and house of followers of Nichiren Shoshu have a Great mandala drawn by the founding father gifted by the Hoshu at that time or a mandala Honzon copied by historical Hoshu is enshrined, and it is without question thought that service to the Honzon should be done 'with the same feeling as waiting upon Nichiren Dai-Shonin himself in the flesh.'
The Honzon is the Enlightenment of a living Buddha, in other words, 'Honbutsu Nichiren Dai-Shonin' himself and at the same time, it connects the senses and boundaries of the founding father as a Ninhonzon into one, expressing the relationship of Ninho-iko (humans and law are melted into one).
This Honzon is known to express soul-searching training, in other words, the actual practical method for attaining enlightenment with one life rather than just the theory of the Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind that is the core of the Hoke-kyo Sutra being "Anyone can certainly become a Buddha" by working and chanting every morning and evening to this Honzon.
The second founding monk, Nikkyo, was strict in following the rules of Buddhism and declared all shrines of other sects as non-followers of Buddhism, but also left writings stating that worshipping should be allowed because upon fulfillment of wide distribution, all shrines and temples in Japan will have enshrined a Honzon.
This may be the reason why some shrines in the vicinity of Taiseki-ji Temple in Fujinomiya City Shizuoka Prefecture enshrine the Honson of Nichiren Shoshu as their sacred body.
There are two forms of the Honzon, 'Paper drawing Honzon' and 'Ita Honzon.'
Paper-drawn Honzon have a mounting and are in the form of a hanging scroll, with two types, 'Joju Honzon (Calligraphy-copied Honzon,' written by the Hoshu, and 'Katachigi Honzon,' which is a printed version of the mandala written by the Hoshu.
The paper-drawn Honzon owned by temples are all 'Joju Honzon,' the same as the 'Doshi Honzon' displayed during funerals.
The Honzon given to followers' homes are 'Katachigi Honzon' (there are also Special Katachigi Honzon), and devout followers can apply for a 'Joju Honzon' to the Grand Head Temple through their affiliated temple.
Ita Honzon' are all 'Joju Honzon.'
They are enshrined in each building of the Grand Head Temple and Main building (Hondo) of each temple, emulating the ' Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon,' with gold-plated characters on a board with a layer of black lacquer.
The cord of the Honzon is placed into the lotus pedestal before enshrinement.
Honzon generally have a gold-colored frame, such as the 'Oza-kawari Honzon' (copied by Nikkyo) enshrined in Taiseki-ji Temple Kyakuden (Taiseki-ji Temple), but some facilities have wooden Honzon while others have paper-drawn Honzon.
It should be added that the Jojuban Honzon and Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon do not have the same form.
Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon are shaped like a log sliced in half, which is not similar to the concept of a 'board.'
Additionally, the date of copying, the owning temple name, the enshrinement place, ganshu, name, etc. may sometimes be written on the side of the Honzon, and the Hoshu name of its copying and his hangyo (Kao) are also written at the bottom.
Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon is considered to be the true reason for the appearance of Nichiren and was drawn by Nichiren himself on October 12, 1279.
Next to Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon enshrined in Taiseki-ji Temple, Hoan-do, there is a kyuden (miniature shrine) enshrining a 3-sun statue of Nichiren called the First Buddha, which is made from a Japanese cinnamon and sculptured by Izumi-ko Nipposhi, when Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon was established and there is a story (legend) that Nichiren saw this and commented that 'it looks similar.'
Regarding the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon, there has been constant discussion by other sects on whether it is real or not.
The photograph in the title page of the book, 'Nichiren Shonin' published in 1911, was given to the author by Ichijo YUI.
It is difficult to see the details, but the opening phrase, Four Guardians and the Kao can be clearly determined.
From this appraisal, it has been pointed out to be similar to the mandala given by Zen in May 8, 1280.
Normally, Shishinden-gohonzon is the name of the Honzon in Fuji Taiseki-ji Temple and Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple.
However, the Honzon in Taiseki-ji Temple and Yobo-ji Temple are completely different.
The one in Taiseki-ji Temple is a paper-drawn Manadara with authentic writing by Nichiren on March 1280, and is described in the fifth volume of the Fujishu Gakuyoshu as 'named Shishinden-gohonzon,' and is a special Honzon that was given to the Emperor when he became a believer in Nichiren's Buddhism and to be kept in the Shishinden, Kyoto Imperial Palace.
Another legend has it that in the age of Nichiu, the ninth head of Taiseki-ji Temple, the Shishinden-gohonzon was engraved in a board to become a 'Substitute Gohonzon' while the honzon (Nichiren Shoshu) was hidden in a cave owned by the Ide family in Numazu for protection from burglars.
The name Shishinden-gohonzon has been a traditional name used for a long time, but at the Insect warding Buddhist ceremony in 2002, the sermon by Nikken, the sixty-seventh Taiseki-ji Temple head said, 'The name should be reconsidered and should be correctly called Shishisosho-no-gohonzon, or Shishidenju-no-gohonzon.'
The one in Yobo-ji Temple is a paper-drawn Manadara given to the Emperor at the Shishinden in 1756, but is considered not to be Nichiren's actual writing.
The Shishinden is part of the Kyoto Imperial Palace and was formerly the Emperor's living quarters.
Since the Emperor's Imperial Palace was moved to Tokyo, it has been under the management of the nation as a cultural asset and it is possible to visit it as a tourist attraction.
The Honzon kept at each temple and displayed at Makura-kyo, wakes, and funerals are 'Doshi Honzon' and is a Honzon for guiding the deceased to Ryozen Jodo for sokushin-joubutsu, and is also called the 'Sokushin-Jobutsu no gohonzon.'
In some cases, the Nokotsu-do in temples such as the Grand Head Temple Taiseki-ji Temple enshrine a Honzon.
The Honzon enshrined in a Nokotsu-do is a Doshi-Honzon for the same reason.
The enshrinement of a Honzon is normally in the form of only the Honzon itself, but some temples employ 'Goei-do style,' where a statue of Nichiren is enshrined in front of the Honzon as it is at the Goei-do (Taiseki-ji Temple) or the 'Separate Three Treasures style,' where the Honzon is in the center and on the left when facing the Honzon is a statue of Nichiren and on the right is a statue of Nikko as it is at the Kyakuden of Taiseki-ji Temple.
Nichiren Shoshu enshrines the Honzon in a Zushi.
It does not place ihai (ancestral tablets) in the Buddhist altar.
A white wooden ihai is used for the funeral but when Nokotsu is performed during the Day 57 or Day 77 ceremony, it is put into the Kako-cho (death register) and the white wooden ihai is given to the temple.
Therefore, the morning and evening Buddhist religious services are performed while looking at the Kako-cho to offer prayers for the deceased.
The Buddhist altar for Nichiren Shoshu is quite different in structure from altars for other sects because it has a Zushi in its inner side.
Some household altars have copied the Zushi in temples.
Followers never place ihai in their altars but the Daikodo at Taiseki-ji Temple have ihai of Nikko and Nichimoku.
This is considered to express Nichiren observing the preaching disciples, Nikko and Nichimoku, who heard Nichiren preach and are directly descended from him.
Sandaihiho (the Three Great Secret Dharmas) comprises the fundamental dharmas in Buddhism by Nichiren and consists of Honmon no Honzon (the Object of Veneration of the Essential Teachings of the Lotus Sutra), Honmon no Kaidan (the Platform for the Receipt of the Precepts and Place of Practice of the Essential Teachings of the Lotus Sutra) and Honmon no Daimoku (the Sacred Title of the Essential Teachings of the Lotus Sutra).
It has been described in "Hoon-sho," "Hokke-shuyo-sho," "Sandaihiho-sho" and so on.
Formally, it is called 'Hokke Honmon-no-Sandaihiho (法華本門の三大秘法).'
It means the Homon (dharma gate), which is secretly embedded within key sentences in the Hoke-kyo Sutra.
As opposed to Goko-han (五綱判) (Shukyo-no-Goka (宗教の五箇)), which focuses on the relative advantage of the sect as compared to other sects, Sandaihiho is called Shushi-no-Sanka (宗旨の三箇) and is generally understood as a principle of transcending and resolving all conflicts from the viewpoint of absolute mercy.
Each Hokke sect interprets it differently, but the following interpretations of the Nichiren sect and Nichiren Shohu sect are representative examples for both ends of the spectrum.
Honmon no Honzon': Honmon no Honzon is a Buddha, specifically Sakyamuni in Gaya Jodo (伽耶成道), who has recognized himself as Nyorai throughout the eternal past, which is written in "Juryo-bon" (a part of the sutra).
Honmon no Kaidan': The place where Daimoku (Namu Myohorenge-kyo) is recited in front of the Honzon (principal image) is known as the "dojo," a place for training (Sokuzedojo (即是道場)).
Honmon no Daimoku': Namu Myohorenge-kyo, which is The Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind of enlightenment by Sakyamuni.
According to the mainstream thinking (such as that of the Icchi-ha sect), these are regarded as general ideas in one's mind, and if one recites the Nichiren chant in front of the principal image--as determined by the Nichiren sect--the place will become 'Honmon no Kaidan.'
Honmon no Honzon (Nichiren Shoshu sect)': Hito-no-Honzon (human principal image) is Nichiren Daishonin (大聖人) and Ho-no-Honzon (principal image of dharma) is Namu Myohorenge-kyo of koto-no-ichinensanzen (事の一念三千), (the Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind).
(The Great Mandala includes both dharmas.)
Honmon no Kaidan': Koto-no-kaidan is a place where Honmon Kaidan Dai-Gohonzon (principal image) is enshrined, and Gi-no-kaidan is a place where Gohonzon stays.
Honmon no Daimoku': The Nichiren chant of belief (信の題目) is to believe Honmon Kaidan Dai-Gohonzon, and the Nichiren chant of practice (行の題目) is to recite Namu Myohorenge-kyo by oneself and recommend it to other people.
Among the Sandaihiho, the principal image is considered to be the supreme entity.
Sandaihiho was created as the root of Dai-Gohonzon of Honmon no Kaidan, which was said to have appeared before the founder of the sect on October 12, 1279, and if one opens this it will become Rokudaihiho (the Six Great Secret Dharmas) of the principal images of human and dharma (Koto-no-kaidan and Gi-no-kaidan) and the Nichiren chants of belief and practice; but if one opens it more, it becomes all 84,000 Homon in Buddhism.
Ichidaihiho (the One Great Secret Dharma) means Honmon no Honzon.
In other words it means Dai-Gohonzon, which includes all Sandaihiho.
If it is opened, it becomes Sandaihiho and Rokudaihiho.
When combined, they become Ichidaihiho.
(See Egihanmon-sho in Rokkan-sho (Six-volume Writings).)
Kokuchu-kai (before the defeat in World War II), Nichiren Shohu and Soka Gakkai (during the post-war period from 1955 to 1965), Fuji Taiseki-ji Kensho-kai and others endeavored to finalize a proposition for a national kaidan (although Nichiren Shohu and Soka Gakkai eventually withdrew the proposition for a national kaidan a few years before the construction of Shohon-do).
They are said to be rare examples in that they tried to interpret Sandaihiho around Kaidan.
Moreover, particularly after the great march of the Shakubuku (an evangelistic technique, in Japanese meaning "break and subdue") of Soka Gakkai, which was started in 1951, the three of the freedom of religion, nonintervention against civil affairs and the Juvenile Act have been given the slang expression Sandaihiho in order to show the shilly-shallying of public administrations such as the government, police and courts of law from both sides, specifically the victims of Shakubuku and the assailants (the devout believers).
Especially, there is information that some experienced members in radical associations advise young members that 'even if your aggressive Shakubuku is in fact accused of the crimes such as threatening, arson, abduction and confinement for the first time, you will be exempted from prosecution as long as you are underage (this includes "suspension of prosecution" as a result of admitting crimes).
This term is used in the same sense on both sides--victims and assailants--which is rarely seen among Buddhist sects of Nichiren lineage, because they usually use different terms and interpretations.
Jien (May 17, 1155 - October 28, 1225) was a priest of the Tendai sect in the Kamakura period and was famous for the history book, "Gukansho."
Shigo, posthumous name (based the deeds one has performed in their lifetime) was Jichin Osho and generally called Yoshimizu Sojo, and in Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets) he was called Saki-no-Daisojo Jien (Former High Priest JIEN).
Jien was the child of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi and Kaga-no-tsubone (a daughter of FUJIWARA no Nakamitsu) and a younger brother of Kanezane KUJO, the sixth child of Tadamichi.
He entered Shorenin Temple in his childhood, and in 1167 he was given vows to follow the precepts by Myoun, the temple's head priest of the Tendai sect.
In 1192, at age 38, he became the head priest of the Tendai sect.
Subsequently, he assumed the position of head priest of Tendai sect four times.
He held Buddhist mass and built temples as the head priest of the Tendai sect; politically, he acted as a guardian for Michiie KUJO (a grandson of Kanezane) and expected that FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (a son of Michiie) would go to Kamakura as the shogun, having the ideal of cooperation between the Imperial Court and the military government.
Additionally, he protected Honen who advocated Senshu Nenbutsu (single-mindedly chanting Namu-amida-butsu, which means devoting oneself to Amida Buddha) and his disciple Shinran, who were regarded as heretics at that time.
Moreover, Shinran entered the priesthood by Jien in 1181, at the age of 9.
He is also famous as a kajin (poet) who left the collection "Shugyoku-shu," and his name is seen in "Senzai Waka-shu (Collection of a Thousand Years)" and so on.
Moreover, he was the lyricist of Entenraku Imayo (a piece of Gagaku, traditional form of music in Japan), which is seen in textbooks.
As to its lyric, see the article on Utaimono (謡物).
"Gukansho" is a history book written by Jien, a priest of the Tendai sect, in the early Kamakura period.
It comprises seven volumes.
It was written around 1220 amid the rising tension between the Imperial Court and the shogunate, just before Jokyu no Ran (the Jokyu Rebellion), but subsequently it was revised.
Summary
It regarded history from the Emperor Jinmu to the Emperor Juntoku as the transition from the age of aristocracy to the age of warriors, and described it in Kana-bun (publication in kana alone) based on Mappo-shiso (the "end of the world" belief) and the idea of 'Dori (Order).'
Jien was a member of the Imperial Court, but he appreciated the government of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.
Additionally, there are descriptions that show the complicated situation around Jien as a member of the Sekkan-ke regent family (摂関家), such as that he implicitly criticized his father FUJIWARA no Tadamichi for being at odds with his own father, FUJIWARA no Tadazane (the grandfather of Jien), and blamed the Konoe clan, his half-brother's clan, as opposed to praising the Kujo clan, his brother's clan.
Composition
"Gukansho" consists of three parts, each of which has a different character: volumes 1 and 2 chronicle the emperors since Jinmu, volumes 3 to 6 center on the transition of Dori together with the descriptions of history, and volume 7 is a general overview on Dori.
According to Masamichi SUZUKI, a professor at Hirosaki University, the writing began with volume 3 and the Emperors' chronicle was added at the end.
In volume 7 he described that everything was based on Dori and that the way to reform society should be implemented by Dori.

Henjo (born 816, died February 12, 890) was an early Heian period poet and one of the Six Poets and also one of the Thirty-six Immortal Poets.
His original name was YOSHIMINE no Munesada.
He was the eighth son of Dainagon YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo, son of the Emperor Kanmu.
There are theories suggesting that his mother was the Emperor Koko's wet nurse.
He had a son called Sosei Hoshi.
Henjo was Kurodo (keeper of imperial archives) for the Emperor Ninmyo, who favored him, and reached the position of Jugoinojo Kurodo no to (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade, head of Kurodo) in 849, but upon the death of the Emperor Ninmyo, he became a priest and was a disciple of Ennin and Enchin.
He established Gankei-ji Temple in Kazan and became Betto (head priest) of Urin-in Temple in Murasakino in 869.
He became Sojo (high Buddhist priest) in 885 and was called Kazan-sojo.
According to the 'Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku' (literally, "the authentic records of three Japanese reigns"), Henjo's seventieth birthday celebration hosted by the Emperor Koko was held in court at the Jinjuden on December 18 (old Lunar calendar), suggesting a teacher-student relationship with the Emperor Koko regarding waka.
The kana introduction in 'Kokin Waka-shu' (the first anthology of poems commissioned by the Emperor) says 'his poems have good taste and style but lack real emotion.
It is like feeling attracted to a picture of a woman.'
About 35 poems have been selected to be included in Imperial-commissioned poem anthologies, beginning with the 'Kokin Waka-shu.'
There is a collection of his poetical works, called 'Henjo-shu,' but it does not have any uniqueness because it is only a collection of poems by Henjo taken from Imperial-commissioned poem anthologies.
The dew drop on the tip of a leaf and the dew that has dropped on the roots, must be an example of life's transience where some people die later and some die earlier.
Heavenly wind, stop the clouds from climbing, so I can keep the beautiful maidens in sight for a little longer.
Henjo was well-suited to be the character of many stories because in spite of being noble-born as a grandchild of the Emperor Kanmu, he climbed to the position of Sojo after becoming a priest of the Tendai sect and was also one of the first priest-poets.
Stories of his amorous exploits before becoming a priest and stories about him not telling his wife when he became a priest are found in 'Yamato Monogatari,' 'Konjaku Monogatari-shu,' 'Hobutsu-shu,' 'Jukkin-sho' and stories about his miracle-working after he became a priest are found in 'Konjaku Monogatari-shu' and 'Zokuhoncho-ojoden.'
He appears under the name of YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo in the Kabuki Dance 'Tsumoru Koi Yuki no Sekinoto' (Love and Deep Snow at the Mountain Barrier), which was produced in the Edo period.
The Shingi Shingon sect is a school of the Shingon sect (whose founding father was Kobo-daishi Kukai), and this school is connected to Raiyu, a high-ranking Buddhist priest of the Kakuban school, which followed the teachings of Kogyo Daishi Kakuban, who brought about the revival of the Shingon sect.
This sect was given the name 'Shingi' because its followers proposed new teachings at Mt Koya.
The original Shingon sect was then given the name 'Kogi Shingon,' but this is not really appropriate as the name was given not because the sect had old teachings but because it was old relative to the Shingi Shingon sect.
The broad definition of 'Shingi Shingon sect' includes Shingi Shingon sect which considers its Grand Head Temple as Grand Head Temple Negoro-ji Temple, Shingon sect Chisan school with its Head Temple at Chishakuin Temple, Shingon sect Buzan school with its Head Temple at Hasedera Temple, Shingon sect Muro-ji school with its Head Temple at Muro-ji Temple, but the narrow definition indicates the group, 'Shingi Shingon sect' which considers its Head Temple as Negoro-ji Temple.
The major difference is that the original Shingon sect (the so-called Kogi Shingon sect) teaches Varirocana teachings (teaching that Dainichinyorai, the highest buddha in the Shingon sect, himself preaches), whereas the Shingi Shingon sect teaches Adhisthana-kaya teachings (teaching that Dainichinyorai becomes Adhisthana-kaya in order to preach).
A heated discussion on religious issues that are irrelevant to normal followers has continued.
History
In the Heian Period, corruption by priests led to a crisis within the Shingon sect and emergency measures to rebuild the sect were taken by Kakuban, who was a high priest of Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple.
However, there was a critical conflict between the conservatives (main temple/Konsobu-ji Temple side) who wanted to keep existing measures and Kakuban school (Daidenpo-in side).
As a result, the Kakuban school left Mt. Koya and transferred their headquarters to Bufuku-ji Temple in Iwate-sho, a manor owned by Daidenpo-in.
Kakuba's activity at Negoro started here.
After the nirvana of Kakuban in 1143, Kakuban school led by one of their priests, Raiyu, re-transferred Daidenpo-in to Mt. Koya, but the argument was not settled and 145 years later in 1288, the acting leader of the Kakuban school, Raiyu, took his followers and returned to Mt. Negoro to further develop Kakuban's teaching and established the Shingi Shingon sect that taught 'Shingi' different to that of conventional teachings.
Later, Negoro-ji Temple's size grew and was significantly militarized with priest soldiers, which Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI determined as disrupting the peace, and in the spring of 1585, a large army attacked Mt. Negoro, totally destroying Negoro-ji Temple and executing many of the priests.
Not only the temple treasures but also most of the Shingi literature, which led to the temple having the reputation, 'Negoro, place of learning,' was burnt to ashes and the Shingi Shingon sect was virtually demolished.
However, in the confusion, some priests reached Hasedera Temple and Chishakuin Temple and survived.
Hideyoshi's policy regarding religion was to divide the Grand Head Temple Negoro-ji Temple into two, Chisan school and Buzan school, and decrease the power of the religious city, Negoro.
Although reconstruction was permitted in the Edo Period, few of the priests that left Negoro did return.
In the Edo period, as part of their program to settle the wrongs of the Toyotomi government, the Tokugawa clan pardoned the Shingi Shingon sect and together with the reconstruction of Negoro-ji Temple, Kakuban was afforded the honorary title of 'Kokyo-Daishi' from the Emperor Higashiyama.
During the late Edo Period, Hoju-Hojo-Koga-Eisho-Shinkai-Shinyu-Joyu KODAMA became the head, and after the Meiji Restoration, Negoro-ji Temple restored the temple head priest title.
The first head priest in the prosperous Chuko period was Buzan school Noke, Shuzen MORINO, and the head priests until that time were mostly heads from Daigo-ji Temple or Ninna-ji Temple, it was a tradition in Negoro-ji Temple to install a Gakuto other than the head priest from external temples.
In 1886, Negoro-ji Temple was selected as the main Dojo of the Shingi school.
Since 1900, the Noke of the Shingi Shingon sect Buzan school and Shingi Shingon sect Chisan school have acted in turn as the Head Priest of Daidenpo-in Temple with three-year rotations, but this tradition of alternating Buzan and Chisan has also been seen since the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) from Genyo-Nisshu-Raigen-Genyu-Senyo.
After World War II, with the revision of the Religious Corporation Act in 1953, the Shingi Shingon sect was established with Negoro-ji Temple as the Grand Head Temple and still exists up to the present day.

Honzon has the following meanings.
Sculptures, paintings, mandalas, named inscriptions of Buddha or Bosatsu, are considered to be the most important objects of religious belief installed in Buddhist temples or altars, or carried around on the body as an amulet.
In religions other than Buddhism, an object of religious attention that is held to be important.
In daily life outside of Buddhism, the central person or person who should not be sidelined or a precious object.
Here we describe the use of Honzon as a Buddhist term.
(Other meanings are derivatives of Honzon as a Buddhist term)
The name and concept of Honzon comes from the teachings of Daibirushanabutsu-Jinpenkaji-kyo Sutra.
There are two conditions to Honzon.
They are clean and unclean.
If the Honzon is clean, it will depart from all and if it is unclean, with thoughts, it will be kei/gyo.
The two conditions to Honzon make two things possible.
Because with thoughts, it can reach the Siddhi (the ultimate destination) of thoughts, and because it is without thoughts, it can create the Siddhi of no thoughts.
Setsu-honzon-sanmai-bon, no. 28
In Japan, during the Kamakura Buddhism period, Nichiren taught that the following three conditions should be observed.
Konpon-sonsu
He should be revered and worshiped as 'the foundation of everything in the world.'
Honrai-soncho
He should be esteemed for being 'what we ourselves should ideally be in the flesh.'
Honnu-songyo
He should reveal his 'appearance and shape of blessed existence' that has always been in existence since the infinite past but was hidden until the present.
This is considered to have been the result of feelings of rivalry towards the Shingon sect founded by Kukai, who Nichiren is thought to have considered as his foremost rival.
The character styles of the Great Mandala for Honzon designated by various schools of the Nichiren sect all show similarity to Bonji (Siddham characters), which is a major characteristic of the Shingon sect.
Honzon of Various sects
The Honzon of major sects in Japanese Buddhism are shown below.
Nanto Six sects - the Honzon differs depending on the temple.
Todai-ji Temple (Kegon sect) Kon-do Honzon is a Vairocana (famous as the Big Buddha), Yakushi-ji Temple (Hosso-shu sect) Kon-do Honzon is Yakushi-nyorai, Kofuku-ji Temple (Hosso-shu) Chukon-do Honzon is Shakanyorai.
Tendai sect - this sect was introduced to Japan by Saicho and inherits teachings from four sects, En (Tendai), Mitsu (Mikkyo), Zen (Zen-shu and Kai (Kairitsu) and the Honzon of each temple varies.
The Honzon of Enryaku-ji Temple is Yakushinyorai for Konpon Chu-do, the east tower of Enryaku-ji Temple, Shakanyorai for Tenhorin-do (Shaka-do) for the west tower and Kannon Bosatsu for the Yokokawa Chu-do in Enryaku-ji Temple Yokokawa.
Some temples like Shinsho Gokuraku-ji Temple have Amidanyorai as a Honzon.
Shingon sect – Dainichinyorai is the most revered, but the Honzon of each temple varies, such as Shakanyorai, Amidanyorai, Yakushinyorai, Kannon Bosatsu and Fudo Myoo.
This is thought to be based on the thinking that all Buddhas are a sign of universal truth and a manifestation of Dainichinyorai, who has attained Buddhism's highest form of existence, in a different appearance.
The Honzon of To-ji Temple, Jingo-ji Temple and Daigo-ji Temple are Yakushinyorai, and Kongobu-ji Temple has Ashuku-nyorai (considered the same as Yakushinyorai) as the Honzon.
Jodo sect - Amidanyorai (seated image)
Jodo Shinshu sect - Honson is one Buddha, Amidanyorai (standing image)
The form is a wooden statue or painted image.
Or a named Honzon of 'Namu Amidabutsu.'
Rinzai sect – Shakanyorai is often the Butsuden Honzon (depending upon past connections, may also be Kannon Bosatsu, Amidanyorai, Jizo Bosatsu, etc.), however, the Zen sect temples tend to revere Soshi images as much as, or sometimes even more than Buddha images.
Soto sect – Shakanyorai is often the Butsuden Honzon (however, it is considered conceptually as existing in the soul)
Depending upon past connections, may also be Kanzeon Bosatsu, Amidanyorai, Jizo Bosatsu, etc.). However, the Zen sect temples tend to revere Soshi (founder) images as much as, or sometimes even more than Buddha images.
Nichiren sect, Hokke sect - 'Sanbo-son' consisting of a pagoda with Shakamunibutsu of Kuonjitsujo, Great Madara drawn just before Nichiren's nirvana in 1282 and the Nichiren chant written in the center, and Shakanyorai and Taho-nyorai on the sides, with a statue of Nichiren below it.
Nichiren Shoshu – Honzon of October 12, 1279 (Nichiren-Shoshu) (usually called, Ita-Mandala)
The Ichimai Kishomon is a will left by Honen on February 27, 1212 just prior to his death.
It is ordinarily entitled Honen Shonin Goikun Ichimai Kishomon.
The original can be seen at Konkaikomyo-ji Temple.
It is displayed to the public during the anniversary of Honen's death on April 23 and 24.

Shaka Sanzon is a style in Buddhism for installing Buddha images.
In Japan, this style normally installs Shakanyorai with a robe worn with the right shoulder exposed with Semu-in, Yogan-in or Seppo-in as the Chuson (center) with Monju Bosatsu riding on a lion to the left and Fugen Bosatsu riding an elephant to the left (as attendant figures).
(The 'left' and 'right' here refers to the 'left' and 'right' seen from the Chuson.)
Rarely, Shakanyorai's attendants are Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu instead of Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu.
Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu are thought to be brother Bosatsu, and they cured people of diseases of the mind and body by giving them good medicine.
The attendant figures of the Shakanyorai Sanzon figures (National Treasure) in Horyu-ji Temple Kon-do are said to be Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu according to temple legend.
The attendant figures of the Honzon Shakanyorai of Kofukuji-ji Temple Chukon-do in Nara (Kamakura Period, Important Cultural Property), are also called Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu.
The Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu of Kofuku-ji Temple were originally attendant figures for the Honzon Shakanyorai in the Saikon-do (removed) Kofuku-ji Temple, and the current figures were reconstructed in the Kamakura Period, but Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu figures have been installed in the Saikon-do since it was established during the Nara Period.
These Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu figures are ordinary Bosatsu figures without any outstanding characteristics regarding appearance, clothing, accessories, etc.
There are also examples of attendant figures being Kannon Bosatsu and Kokuzo Bosatsu or Bonten and Taishakuten.
The various schools of Zen sects such as Rinzai sect, Soto sect and Obaku sect place importance on 'Shaka as a human' and in some cases have Daikasho-sonja and Anan-sonja as attendant figures to Shakanyorai, together with Judai deshi or Juroku Zenshin.
Nichiren sect and Hokke sect place importance on 'Shaka as Honbutsu' and install a Taho Pagoda (pagoda) in the center with Shakamuni-butsu and Taho-nyorai on either side.
The attendants are the four major Bosatsu, Benhuadiyong, Jogyo Bosatsu, Muhengyo Bosatsu, Jogyo Bosatsu and Anryugyo Bosatsu.
In this case, it differs from other Sanzon figures in the configuration of one Seson-two Bosatsu, but is a two Seson-four Bosatsu.
Bonsho are hanging bells as a Buddhist equipment used in East Asian temples.
It is rung with a wooden bell hammer and has a heavy resonant sound.
It is more normally known as the bells rung on New Year's Eve.
Other names include Ogane, Kosho, Horo, Geisho, Kyogei, Kagei, etc.
"Bon" is a phonetic translation of "Brahma" (holy and clean) of Sanskrit.
Depending upon the country of production, it is called a Chinese bell, Korean bell (Goryeo bell, Silla bell), and Washo (Japanese bell).
Although Buddhism is a religion that originated in India and has expanded throughout Asia, the origins of Bonsho are hardly found in India but in ancient Chinese bronze ware.
The bronze ware "Sho," produced during the Yin and Zhou periods, are thought to be the origins of Bonsho, but generally the size of "Sho" is small and the cross-section is not a circle as found in Bonsho of later times but it is almond-shaped.
As an old example of Chinese Bonsho, there is a bell in Nara National Museum that has the inscription of Chen (South Dynasty) in 575.
This bell with the inscription of 575 is similar to Japanese bells in later times and is considered to be their predecessor because it has a circular cross-section, horizontal and vertical bands dividing the bell body, hook section for hanging the bell that is shaped like a dragon and a Tsukiza (pedestal of the bell) decorated with a lotus pattern.
However, the small round projections called "Chi" do not have any decorations and this is different from Japanese Bonsho.
Regarding the introduction of Bonsho to Japan, there is a record in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) stating that OTOMO no Sadehiko brought one back from Goguryeo in 562, but an actual artifact from this time has not been found.
The Bonsho in Myoshin-ji Temple in Kyoto (National Treasure) has an inscription of the year of 698 on the inner side and this is the oldest Japanese Bonsho with a confirmed production date.
Korean Bonsho before the Goryeo period are found not only in the Korean Peninsula but also many in Japan and the oldest one with an established date, the year of 833, is the bell in Jogu-jinja Shrine in Fukui Prefecture.
Most Japanese Bonsho are modeled on the Chinese bell style and ones on the Korean style are considered to be rare.
Originally, Bonsho has the important role of Buddhism to be rung as a first bell signaling Buddhist rites including Buddhist memorial services.
It is also used to keep time in the morning and evening (Gyosho (the morning ringing) and Konsho (the evening ringing)).
However, the Bonsho was not rung simply to indicate time, but listening to the resonance allows the listener to escape all suffering and attain enlightenment.
Such merits of the Bonsho are commonly found in the inscriptions on the bell.
Many are made from bronze, but some small-sized bells are rarely made from iron.
Small-sized bells (in one theory, ones under approximately 51.5 cm in diameter), called Hansho (Kansho, Densho), have a high-pitched sound used for not only Buddhist rites but also as an alarm bell for fires, etc.
To improve the resonance, it is said that sometimes rings (gold) were included when the bell was cast, and there are examples in the Edo period where oval gold coins were cast together.
There are also some documents suggesting the relationship between Gagaku (Japanese traditional music and dance) and bells.
Many Bonsho in Japan were donated and melted down during World War II in response to the Metal Collection Act.
Bells that were designated cultural property and other old or important bells still exist, but many bells produced in modern times were melted down and it is said that over 90% of Japanese bells were lost during World War II.
The main body of Japanese bells is divided horizontally by three horizontal bands called Jotai (the upper band), Chutai (the middle band) and Katai (the lower band), and also divided in the vertical direction by bands referred to as Jutai (vertical bands).
There are normally 4 Jutai and they divide the bell body into 4 parts (some modern bells have 5).
The upper region between Jotai and Chutai is called "Chi-no-ma", and the bottom region is called "Ike-no-ma."
"Chi-no-ma" has small decorative projections called "Chi."
"Ike-no-ma" may be without any decorations, but in some cases, this is where an inscription is cast (or engraved) or images such as tennin or Buddha are placed.
The region between Chutai and Katai is called "Kusa-no-ma."
2 Tsukiza are usually set symmetrically in the bell body where the hammer hits (in some rare cases, there are 4 Tsukiza).
The principal decoration of the Tsukiza is a lotus pattern.
The basic shape of Japanese bells did not change substantially from the Nara period to the Edo period, but there are small characteristic differences for each period.
One major point for determining the age of Bonsho is the positional relationship between Tsukiza and Ryuzu (dragon-shaped hanger).
In bells from the Nara period to the early Heian period, the line connecting the two Tsukiza and the long axis of Ryuzu are usually perpendicular.
In other words, the direction that the bell swings and the long axis of Ryuzu bisect each other at right angles.
On the other hand, bells made after the late Heian period have a different Ryuzu position and the line connecting the two Tsukiza and the long axis of Ryuzu are usually in the same direction.
In other words, the direction that the bell swings and the long axis of Ryuzu is the same (there are some exceptions).
Additionally, the position of Tsukiza of bells in the Nara period and early Heian period were high and placed close to the center of the bell body, whereas bells after the late Heian period tend to have a lower Tsukiza position.
The Bonsho researcher, Ryohei TSUBOI regards the following 16 bells as Bells of the Nara period.

Seishi Bosatsu, Bon name: mahaasthaamapraapta, is a Bosatsu in Buddhism.
It is sometimes written as Daiseishi Bosatsu or Tokudaiseishi Bosatsu.
The Sanmayagyo symbol is mibu renge (lotus bud).
Shushi (Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism)) (Shuji) is Saku (saH).
The Kyoji (statues that accompany a central Buddha figure) to the right of Amida Sanzon govern the Chimon of Buddha and inspires Bodaishin (a desire to attain enlightenment and save others) in people.
This Bosatsu saves people from falling into hell and the world of hungry spirits by holding the light of wisdom to lighten all things.
Currently, it is known in Japan as the guardian Honzon of the year of the horse.
The reason why it is thought to be called Daiseishi is that it can successfully 'reach' the point where many things can be 'Daisei' or saved.
In Japan, it is very rare for Seishi Bosatsu to be the sole target of religious attention, and is usually found as an attendant figure of Amida Sanzon.
Whereas Kannon Bosatsu have an artificial Buddha on the front of the diadem, Seishi Bosatsu customarily have a water jug.
In the Raigo (literally, "welcoming") style of Amida Sanzon, in which the Buddha is believed to descend to Earth to welcome a believer facing death, the Kannon Bosatsu holds a lotus-shaped pedestal, whereas Seishi Bosatsu is expressed as having his palms held together in prayer.
From the Medieval Period, there has been a theory that Honen was an incarnation of Seishi Bosatsu.
Honen was called Seishi-maru when he was a child, and was full of knowledge and will during his lifetime, being called 'Honen-bo, no. 1 for knowledge and will.'
After Honen's death, his disciple Shinran wrote 'Daiseishi Bosatsu Wasan' and said 'Daiseishi Bosatsu is Genku Shonin (Honen)'s Honji (substance)' in the end.
Eshin-ni Shosoku' has a story where Shinran's wife, Eshin-ni has a mystical dream where she sees 'a bright Buddha full of light' and hears a voice saying 'that is Seishi Bosatsu, in other words, Honen.'
In Chion-in Temple Kyoto, Seishi-do was established to install Seishi Bosatsu as the Honzon.
This is considered Honen's Honji.
This figure is joining his palms in the same style as Seishi Bosatsu as attendant in Raigo style Amida Sanzon
In the Medieval Period, many copies of the Zenko-ji-nyorai (Zenko-ji-shiki Amida Sanzon) in Nagano were made and the two Bosatsu, Kannon and Seishi, are shown with hands on top of each other and placed in front of their chest.
Yakushi sanzon, or Yakushi triad, is one of the styles to place Buddhist images in Buddhism.
It is a triad style and consists of Yakushi-Nyorai (Bhaisajyaguru) at the center (Chuson) and two Kyoji (attendant figures), Nikko Bosatsu (Sunlight Bodhisattva) on the left and Gakko Bosatsu (Moonlight Bodhisattva) on the right.
(The 'left' or 'right' in this case is the direction as seen from Yakushi-Nyorai).
The name of Gakko Bosatsu means to be free from the burning earthly desires of life and death of living things with the coolness of the moon.
The statue of the principal image of Buddha at Kondo (Golden Hall) in Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara City is an old example of Yakushi sanzon statues and is one of the masterpieces in Japan.
Generally, Chuson was made as a sedentary statue and Kyoji were made as standing statues like the statues of Yakushi-ji Temple, but in some cases both Chuson and Kyoji were made as sedentary statues such as in the Daikodo Lecture Hall of Horyu-ji Temple.
Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu
Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu are described as the main Buddha in the Buddhist paradise of Yakushi-Nyorai, the realm known as Joruri or Pure Lapis Lazuli in the eastern quarter, Vaiduryanirbhasa in Sanskrit in "Yakushi Hongan-kyo Sutra," and it can be said that there is neither faith nor statues of Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu individually, other than the statues of the Kyoji of Yakushi-Nyorai.
From the viewpoint of iconography, each Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu often has the sun disc and the moon disc, but there are old cases where they have no belongings, like the statue at the Kondo hall in Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara.
In addition, in some cases Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu are Kyoji in place of other statues except at Yakushi-Nyorai.
For example, the Kyoji of Senju Kannon (Sahasrabhuja-arya-avalokites 'vara, "Thousand-armed Kannon" or Kannon with a thousand arms) Statue, the principal image of Buddha at Dojo-ji Temple in Wakayama Prefecture, are Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu.
The Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu statues which are placed on both sides of Fukukensaku Kannon, (or Fukukenjaku Kannon, Never Empty Lasso Kannon (deity of Mercy)), the principal image at Hokke-do (Sangatsudo) of Todai-ji Temple in Nara are famous as masterpieces of Tenpyo sculpture (style of sculpture created in Tenpyo period) but the original names of the statues are not known and they seem to have not been shaped as Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu from the beginning.
Yuzu Nenbutsu sect is one of the sects of pure land teachings, Jodo-kyo.
When Sho Taishi Ryonin, priests of the Tendai sect, were performing the ascetic practices at Ohara Raigo-in Temple (Sakyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City) on June 16, 1117 during the end of Heian period, he was given Gemon of 速疾往生 (the way for one to reach Buddhism quickly from Amida Nyorai(Amitabha Tathagata)), '一人一切人 一切人一人 一行一切行 一切行一行 十界一念 融通念仏 億百万編 功徳円満' from Amida Nyorai and founded the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect.
It is also called Dainenbutsu sect.
Grand Head Temple
Dainenbutsu-ji Temple (Hirano Ward, Osaka City)
It was built by Ryonin, the founder of the sect, according to the imperial prayers of the Emperor Toba in 1127.
It is said that it was the former Shuraku-ji Temple, which was built in the personal residence of SAKANOUE no Hirono, who was the second son of SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro and was commonly called 'Hirano-dono,' who developed this area in the Heian period.
It was the first Buddhist invocation dojo, or place of Buddhist practice or meditation.
Dharma
Its main sutras (正依) are "Kegon-kyo Sutra"(Avatamska Sutra) and "Hoke-kyo Sutra" (Lotus Sutra) and minor sutras (傍依) are "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra"(Sutra of Infinite Life) and "Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra" ('The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life,' meaning Amida) and "Amida-kyo Sutra" (Amida Sutra), and it preaches that reciting Buddhist invocation makes people reincarnated in Jodo, pure land, from the viewpoint that 'Buddhist invocation by one person equals Buddhist invocation to all people.'
History
Yuzu Nenbutsu, which Ryonin began, was mainly temple solicitation and pilgrimage at first and developed from a collective motion having no organization as a Buddhism sect.
Yuzu Nenbutsu became popular, such as in Dainenbutsu-ji Temple at Hirano (Osaka City) in Osaka and Seiryo-ji Temple and Mibu-dera Temple in Kyoto, and Dainenbutsu-kyogen Dainenbutsu Kyogen (Kyogen (farce played during a No play cycle) to teach Buddhism to the public) by Engaku Shonin, the restorer of Yuzu Nenbutsu, and has been transmitted at Mibu-dera Temple, Seiryo-ji Temple, Injo-ji Temple (Kyoto City) and Shinsen-en.
The 7th Homyo in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) was regarded as the restorer and established the system of Roku Betsuji (六別時制度) which selected the chief priest of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple.
It began to have color as a sect around the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States), but the tradition of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple was stopped several times and the temples of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect became other sect's temples and lost traction.
From 1688 to 1703, the Yukan of the 46th head priest of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple, who was regarded as a founder of the reemergence of Yuzu Nenbutsu, tried to revive Yuzu Nenbutsu by putting dharma in the statutory form by 'Yuzu enmonsho' (Outlines of the Yuzu-Nembutsu Theology), determining rules as a sect and providing dormitory, which led to the establishment of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect.
Since 'Yuzu enmonsho' was written in kanbun, classical Chinese, 'Yuzu nenbutsu shingesho' (document for understanding and mastering Yuzu nenbutsu), which was written in Japanese, were widespread in order to cover the negative effects of the former.
Character
The greatest characteristic of Yuzu Nenbutsu is that it put higher value on Invocation of the Buddha's Name than Kanso Nenbustu (Buddha ideation through chanting and visualization), so that the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect makes reciting Buddhism invocation (Yuzu Nenbutsu), which was preached by Ryonin and expects Jikkai (ten spiritual realms) Ichinen (a single repetition of a prayer) and rebirth in Jodo of Jita Yuzu (自他融通, literally, Yuzu Nenbutsu for oneself and others), ten times toward the west every morning as a daily duty.
It was the pioneering work of Senshu Nenbutsu (the Single-Minded Recitation of the Nenbutsu) and transmitted the purer Jodo-kyo Buddhism of the Tendai sect, so that it can be said to have the advanced form and content of the later Jodo and Jodo Shinshu sects.
Fugen Bosatsu, samanta bhadra in Sanskrit, is a venerable Bosatsu entity and is Bodhisattva, which is worshipped in Mahayana Buddhism.
Sanma yagyo (characteristic things of the Buddha) is a sword and Gokosho (A short club with five prongs at each end, usually made of gilt bronze).
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) is aM and huuM.
The Sanskrit name samanta bhadra means 'far and widewise man' and that he is a wise man who appears in the far and wide world and relieves people with Buddha's mercy and intelligence.
In addition, since it is seen in Hoke-kyo Sutra which preaches Nyonin Jobutsu (Attainment of Buddhahood by women), it has been especially worshipped by women.
In Mikkyo it is regarded as a symbol of aspiration for Buddhahood (a mind to seek enlightenment through mastering the truth) and seen as the same entity as Kongosatta which has the same character.
For this reason, Fugen Bosatsu is often called Kongoshu Bosatsu, another name for Kongosatta, as well.
Mt. Gabi (Emeishan) in Sichuan Province, China are regarded as Reijo, sacred ground, of the Fugen Bosatsu and statues are placed as Kyoji, attendant figures, of Shakanyorai with Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri).
(See Shaka sanzon, Shaka triad.)
As an individual Buddha, the most common figure is expressed as a figure which joins its hands in prayer in the lotus position on a white elephant that has six ivory tusks and has Rengeza (padmasana, Lotus base) on the back.
In Mikkyo it is expressed as a figure which has a lotus stem on which a treasure sword is placed in the left hand and a figure which has gokorei (a five-pronged bell) in the left hand and Gokosho in the right hand in the same way as Kongosatta, and figures which have nyoi (an implement carried by Buddhist priests at a ceremony or during formal preaching), lotus flower and scriptures as well.
In Japan from the middle of the Heian period, it was worshipped mainly by noble women in accordance with the prevalence of Hoke-kyo Sutra, which preaches women's relief.
In Japan there are many pictures and statues, such as the wooden statue (national treasure) of Fine Arts in the latter part of Heian period at The Okura Shukokan Museum.
Fugen Enmei Bosatsu,' has venerable status and was more strongly influenced by Mikkyo, and is regarded as a strong venerable entity with 22 hands and many examples of this work have been made in Japan.
Concerning pictures, the picture of Fugen Bosatsu on an elephant in Tokyo National Museum (national treasure, the latter part of the Heian period) is a representative work.
The book of Bujo-ji Temple in Tottori Prefecture (national treasure) and the book of Nara National Museum (important cultural property) and others are known as representative works.
It is said that the kenzoku of Fugen Bosatsu is ju-rasetsunyo, or ten demonesses, and that sometimes Kishimo-jin, a mother of the Ju-rasetsunyos, is placed as kenzoku.
At an early date, Ju-rasetsunyo put employed Tang dynasty Chinese costumes, but there are also many works of Ju-rasetsunyo using Japanese costumes influenced by Japanese culture.
This is because Fugen Bosatsu and Ju-rasetsunyo swear 'to guard people who defend Hoke-kyo Sutra' together in Hoke-kyo Sutra, and it became the reason for women's belief that these goddess's stay close to Fugen Bosatsu.
In addition, in the novel "Feng-Shen-Yen-I" (Popular Account of the Promotion to Divinity), the Sennin (wizards) named Fugen Shinjin and Monju Koho Tenson appeared and later came to believe in Buddhism, and subsequently became Fugen Bosatsu and Monji Bosatsu, respectively.
On Sanmaya Sabaton.
Kyoto Gozan Temples refers the status of a Buddhist temple, and to the system of state-sponsored temples of the Zen sect (Rinzai sect) in Kyoto among the Five Mountain System.
Since around the end of the Kamakura Period, the Hojo clan introduced the Five Mountain System and selected Kamakura Five Mountain after the example of the Southern Sungs.
In the latter part of the Kamakura Period, the Emperor Godaigo started an anti-Shogunate movement and when the Kenmu Restoration by the Emperor Godaigo began after the fall of the Shogunate, the Five Mountain System was reformed to meet with Kyoto.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), after Takauji ASHIKAGA left the Kenmu Government, Five Mountain was newly selected from temples in Kyoto mainly by Soseki MUSO, whom the Ashikaga Shogunate family trusted, because Takauji and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA trusted the Zen sect.
Although there were several changes of selection, in 1386 the third Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA determined it as follows after construction of Shokoku-ji Temple, and took over the power of appointing chief priests by the system of Sorokushi (僧録司) and therefore controlled temples, which added a religious aspect to the prestige of the Shogunate.
The priests of Five Mountain, such as Myoha SHUNOKU and Shushin GIDO, were familiar with Chinese culture and played roles as diplomatic counselors when Yoshimitsu carried out trade between the Ming Dynasty and Japan (licensed trade).
Nanzen-ji Temple - Bekkaku (exceptional)
Tenryu-ji Temple - the first grade*
Shokoku-ji Temple - the second grade*
Kennin-ji Temple - the third grade
Tofuku-ji Temple - the fourth grade
Manju-ji Temple - the fifth grade
*Moreover, in accordance with Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA's wish, Shokoku-ji Temple was changed to the first grade and Tenryu-ji Temple was changed to the second grade on April 27, 1401, but after Yoshimitsu's death they were reverted back to the former grades on April 11, 1410.
Sessai TAIGEN or Sufu TAIGEN (1496 - November 23,1555) was a vassal of the Imagawa clan.
The posthumous name was Sufu.
He was a son of Masamori IHARA (Saemon-no-jo (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards)) and his mother was a daughter of Masanobu OKITSU.
The Ihara clan on the paternal side ruled around Ihara of Suruga Province (present Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture).
The Okitsu clan on the maternal side grasped marine transport, based on Yokoyama-jo Castle, and also headed the pirates (navy).
Both clans were senior vassals of the Imagawa clan.
Biography
At first, he identified himself as Shogiku KYUEI and practiced ascetic training at Zentoku-ji Temple in Suruga, and later at Kennin-ji Temple of the Kyoto Gozan (Five Great zen Temples of Kyoto).
He was said to be a promising brilliant person at around this time.
He was asked to serve the Imagawa clan by his master, Ujichika IMAGAWA, who heard this reputation, and was appointed to educate his fifth son, Hogiku-maru (later Yoshimoto IMAGAWA).
According to one estimate, he refused this request twice.
In 1530 Hogiku-maru had a Tokudo ceremony (entering Buddhist priesthood) by Ryusu JOAN, his master at the Kennin-ji Temple and changed his name to Shoho.
The two moved to Kennin-ji Temple for more ascetic training from Zentoku-ji Temple, and later moved to Myoshin-ji Temple.
Around this time Shoho was given Dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) 'Baigaku' and identified himself as Shogiku BAIGAKU and later changed his name to Sufu TAIGEN (Sessai).
In 1535 he went back to Suruga in order to participate in the sixth anniversary of the death of Shoshun KINKEI who was a chief priest of Zentoku-ji Temple, and entered Zentoku-ji Temple again.
In the following year, 1536, Ujiteru IMAGAWA, who succeeded Ujichika, died.
A succession race between Shoho BAIGAKU and his half brother Etan GENKO, among the Imagawa clan, occurred (Hanakura War).
Sessai supported Shoho BAIGAKU with Jukei-ni, and achieved his succession to the clan and exclaustration.
By that achievement, Yoshimoto IMAGAWA put strong faith in Sessai and gave him the supreme post of politics and military affairs.
While Sessai had religious influence as a chief priest of Sunpu Rinzai-ji Temple (Shizuoka City), he was also called 'administrative ruler' or 'general' of the Imagawa clan and supported Yoshimoto with impressive ability in politics, military affairs and foreign policy.
In 1537 he struck an alliance of marriage with the Takeda clan.
He held talks with the Gohojo clan in Sunto.
In 1547 he captured Tahara-jo Castle in Mikawa Province.
At the Battle of Azuki-zaka slope with the Oda clan in 1548, he had an advantage as a commander in chief.
In 1549 he attacked Ansho-jo Castle and captured Nobuhiro ODA (half brother of Nobunaga ODA) and returned Takechiyo MATSUDAIRA, a hostage of the Oda clan, back to the Imagawa clan side.
In 1553 he established 21 articles of Imagawa Kana Mokuroku Tsuika (expanding on the Imagawa family rules), which is bunkokuho (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain) of the Imagawa territory.
In 1554 he made efforts for Suruga Province to form a tripartite alliance with the Takeda clan of Kai Province and the Gohojo clan of Sagami Province.
In addition to these, Sessai contributed greatly to the height of prosperity of the Imagawa clan by controlling temples and religions, mainly those of the Rinzai sect, and implementing commercial policy to protect local merchants in the Imagawa territory.
Moreover, he was also a well-educated person and wrote "Rekidaijoryaku" (a book about chinese history).
In 1555 he died at Chokei-ji Temple in Suruga Province.
He was at the age of 60 years.
Others
It is said that he also acted as guardian of Ujizane IMAGAWA, the legitimate son of Yoshimoto IMAGAWA, and Motoyasu MATSUDAIRA (Ieyasu TOKUGAWA), a hostage of the Imagawa clan at that time, but it was during the same period as Sessai left Suruga (during negotiations with the Takeda and Gohojo clans and expedition to Mikawa Province) so it is unknown whether he in fact influenced both persons or not.
Since he displayed great ability as Yoshimoto IMAGAWA's right-hand man and contributed much to the expansion of the Imagawa clan, much literature recognizes him by such as, 'If Sessai had lived until the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, Yoshimoto would not have been subverted by Nobunaga ODA,' and 'the Imagawa clan started to decline soon after Sessai's death.'
Sho Kannon, aarya avalokitezvara in Sanskrit is a venerable entity of Bosatsu, Bodhisattva, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
It is also called 'Sei Kannon' and is one of the Roku Kannon (six Kannon).
There are various figures of the statue of Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu (Kanzeon Bosatsu, Kanjizai Bosatsu), among which the statues with one face and two arms are called Sho Kannon, not the statues with superhuman appearance and many faces and arms.
聖観音 (Sho Kannon, literally Sacred Kannon) is also written as 正観音 (Sho Kannon, literally Real Kannon).
It is said that it benefits Jigoku-do (world of hell) as Kannon with great mercy in the role of Roku Kannon.
Sanma yagyo (characteristic things of the Buddha) Symbol is shokatsu renge (a slightly-opened lotus bud).
Shushi (or Shuji (the characteristic one syllable word to depict the Bodhisattva)) (Esoteric Buddhism) are sa, hriiH and so on.
Features of statue and belongings
There are Henge Kannon (The transformations in which Kannon (Deity of Mercy) appears in order to save sentient beings) which has many faces and many arms such as Juichimen Kannon (Eleven-faced Kannon), Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Kannon) and Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion), and Kannon which has one face and two arms and do not have a superhuman figure; the latter is called 'Sho Kannon (聖観音 or 正観音).'
In Esoteric Buddhism, Sho Kannon, Juichimen Kannon, Senju Kannon, Nyoirin Kannon, Bato Kannon (horse-headed Kannon) and Jundei Kannon (Cundi) (or Fukukensaku Kannon (Fukukenjaku Kannon) (Kannon of the Never Empty Lasso) in place of Jundei Kannon) are called 'Roku Kannon.'
The features of Sho Kannon are generally Bosatsu, with one face and two arms as mentioned above, and its Jimotsu (the hand-held attributes of a Buddhist image) is lotus in the left hand, but it is not always uniform.
What is most distinguishable for a Kannon statue is to place a small statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), called Kebutsu (the Artificial Buddha), on the front top part of its head, which is a common characteristic with other Kannon statues such as Senju Kannon.
Kannon' or 'Sho Kannon'
All Kannon statues with one face and two arms are not necessarily called 'Sho Kannon.'
The Kannon statue, which is placed as the left Kyoji (attendant figure) of Amida sanzon (Amida triad), is generally called only 'Kannon Bosatsu statue' and it is limited to being called 'Sho Kannon' when it is enshrined individually.
In addition, there are many cases where even the individual Kannon statue with one face and two arms is not called 'Sho Kannon.'
For example, at Horyu-ji Temple in Nara, there are three National Treasure Kannon statues which are commonly called 'Kudara Kannon' (Kannon of Kudara), 'Yumechigai Kannon' (dream changing Kannon) and 'Kuse Kannon' (Kannon of salvation), and the official names of these three statues at the time of recognition as national treasures were 'the standing statues of Kannon Bosatsu' so that they are not called 'Sho Kannon' as either official names nor as popular names.
Among the so-called Small Gilt Bronze Buddhist Statues, which were widely made mainly during the Nara period, many statues are clearly recognized as Kannon statues because of placing a Kebutsu of Amida Nyorai on the head, but these are usually just called 'Kannon (Bosatsu) statues' instead of 'Sho Kannon' as well.
Among the statues called 'Sho Kannon' in general and by the temple, the statue of the principal image of Buddha at Toin-do of Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture (Nara period, National Treasure), the statue of the principal image of Buddha at Futai-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture (Important Cultural Property) and the statue at Kurama-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture (Important Cultural Property) are famous.
Nyoirin Kannon, cintaamaNicakra in Sanskrit, is a venerable entity of Bosatsu, Bodhisattva, and is worshipped in Buddhism.
It is a transformed figure of Kannon Bosatsu and one of the Roku Kannon (six Kannon).
Sanma yagyo (characteristic things of the Buddha) is Nyoi hoju (a sacred jewel, said to remove suffering, and capable of granting every wish) and a red lotus flower.
Shushi (or Shuji (the characteristic one syllable word to depict the Bodhisattva)) (Esoteric Buddhism) is hriiH.
In Japan it has various names such as 'Nyoirin Kannon Bosatsu,' 'Nyoirin Kanzeon Bosatsu' and 'Daibonjinon Kannon,' and the designated name, such as for an important cultural property, was 'Nyoirin Kannon.'
It is also called 'Kuse (or Guse) Bosatsu.'
Nyoi is an abbreviation of Nyoi hoju, a wish-fulfilling jewel (Cintamani), and Rin is an abbreviation of Horin, Dharma-wheel (cakra) and its true wish is to preach at will, living in zanmai (samadhi) of Nyoi hoju, removing the troubles of living things in Rokudo (six posthumous worlds) and provides benefits to these worlds.
Nyoi hoju fulfills all hopes and Horin is a Buddhist symbol to destroy Bonno (earthly desires), and which was transformed from Chakuram, a weapon in ancient India originally.
As the role of Roku Kannon, it is said to be Sekke (edification) Tenbu (deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another).
All Nyoin Kannon statues are basically seated statues or Hanka (half-lotus posture) statues so that standing statues are not seen.
Many statues have six arms, and are sitting with one knee up, but there are also Hanka statues with two arms, which have totally different figures from the former.
The statues with six arms have Nyoi hoju and Horin, which are origins of its name, in two of the six hands.
Among the works of Nyoirin Kannon in Japan, the principal image of Buddha at Kanshin-ji Temple in Osaka Prefecture is a representative statue with six arms.
Among six hands, its first right hand shows Shiyui-so, meditative posture, with its chin resting upon its hand, and it has Nyoi Hoju in the second right hand in front of its breast and beadroll in the third right hand hanging to the outside.
On the other hand, the first left hand touches the earth, spreading the palm, the second left hand supports Mikaifu renge, unopened lotus and the third left hand supports Horin at its finger tips.
The statue at Kanno-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture, the principal image of Buddha at Kannon-do in Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple), the statue in the main hall of Muro-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture and the statue at Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture are statues with six arms and are the same as the statue at Kanshin-ji Temple.
The statue at Ishiyama-dera Temple in Shiga, which is a Buddhist image not usually shown to the public, has been famous as the Nyoirin Kannon statue with two arms since ancient times.
The principal image of Buddha of Oka-dera Temple in Asuka is also a statue with two arms.
The principal image of Chugu-ji Temple, next to Horyu-ji Temple, is a typical hanka shiyui-zo, a position with the left leg pendent (hanka), the right leg crossed over the left knee, and the fingers of the right hand lightly touching the cheek (shiyui).
This statue has been called a Nyoirin Kannon statue since ancient times, but the name at the time of being shaped is not clear so that it is highly possible that it was made as a statue of Miroku Bosatsu, Maitreya Bodhisattva.
In addition, it was worshipped at Jukuya-ko (the women gather on the 19th of the month to pray for easy delivery and family health and safety on nineteenth night of the lunar calendar) in recent times.

Kokuzo Bosatsu is Ākāśagarbh or Gaganagajja in Sanskrit, and is a Bosatsu that is revered in Buddhism.
The Sanmayogyo Symbol is Hoken (treasured sword) and Nyoi hoju (wish-fulfilling jewel).
Shushi (Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism)) (Shuji) is Trāh.
Known mantras are 'OM vajraratna, OM trāh svāhā' and 'Namah Ākāśagarbhāya, OM arika mari muri svāhā,' known to be used in 'Kokuzo Gumonji-ho,' an incantation method to pray for enhanced memory skills.
Kokuzo' literally means 'to have Koku,' and the Kokuzo Bosatsu is a Bosatsu that has limitless wisdom and compassion like the wide universe.
Therefore, this Bosatsu is worshiped for virtues such as wisdom, knowledge and memory.
The incantation method 'Kokuzo Gumonji-ho' involves chanting mantras 1 million times over 100 days following certain rules, and those who complete this method become able to memorize, understand and never forget all Buddhist texts.
The legend that Kukai secluded himself in the Mikurodo caves at Muroto-misaki Cape to complete Kokuzo Gumonji-ho is well known, and Nichiren also worshiped Kokuzo Bosatsu for 21 days when he started to follow the teachings of Buddha at the age of twelve.
Horin-ji Temple in Arashiyama, Kyoto (Nishikyo Ward Kyoto City) has an event called "thirteen visit," where boys and girls who have turned thirteen visit to receive wisdom from Kokuzo Bosatsu.
It is the central figure of the Garbha-mandala in Kokuzo-in, and is esteemed in Mikkyo as well.
The images hold a Hoken in the right hand and Nyoi-hoju in the left, and some images show their right palm facing downwards in a wish-granting mudra and hold Nyoi-hoju in the left.
The latter image form is found in Honzon for Gumonji-ho and the National Treasure image owned by the Tokyo National Museum has this form.
Major examples of sculptures are the figures in Kakuan-ji Temple, Yamatokoriyama City Nara Prefecture and in Koryu-ji Temple Kodo, Kyoto City.
The wooden Kokuzo Bosatsu standing figure in Horin-ji Temple (Ikaruga-cho) in Ikaruga-cho Nara Prefecture is an old figure from about the seventh century, but it is not clear whether it was called a Kokuzo Bosatsu from the beginning.
The Kudara Kannon in Horyu-ji Temple was called a 'Kokuzo Bosatsu figure' within the temple until the early Meiji Period.
Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu
The Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu is a group of figures consisting solely of Kokuzo Bosatsu.
It expresses the five wisdoms of Koku Bosatsu with 5 Bosatsu figures, and is also said to be a different incarnation of Gochi-nyorai.
The Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu is the Honzon of prayers for good health and prosperity.
The name, direction and body color of the Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu are as follows.
Hokkai Kokuzo (center, white)
Kongo Kokuzo (east, yellow)
Hoko Kokuzo (south, blue)
Renge Kokuzo (west, red)
Goyo Kokuzo (north, black-purple)
An example of sculptures of the Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu are the figures in Jingo-ji Temple Tahoto in Kyoto (early Heian Period, National Treasure).
The Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu figures in To-ji Kanchi-in Temple, Kyoto (Important Cultural Property) were brought back from Tang by Eun, who was the disciple of one of Kukai's disciples.
The figures of Hokkai, Kongo, Hoko, Renge and Goyo sit on a lotus pedestal on top of a horse, lion, elephant, golden bird and peacock, respectively.
The figures in Kanchi-in Temple were originally in Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) and (Yamashina Ward Kyoto City).
Zao Gongen is a venerable entity worshipped in Buddhism in Japan.
It is an original Buddha of Japan without origins in India, and is known as the principal image of the main hall (Zao-do) of Kinpusen-ji Temple, in Yoshino, Nara Prefecture.
Gongen means 'god or Buddha which appears in a temporary figure.'
There is a tradition that EN no Ozunu (practitioners of Shugen-do (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) around the seventh centuries) transformed to Zao Gongen during ascetic training at Mt. Kinpu in Yoshino.
It is considered to be combined with Shaka, Kannon (Deity of Mercy) and Miroku (Maitreya), and the three statues of Zao Gongen, which have almost the same figures, are enshrined as the principal image at Zao-do in Yoshino.
EN no Ozunu himself was a legendary figure and it is not clear when the statue of Zao Gongen began to be shaped actually.
At Ishiyama-dera Temple in Shiga Prefecture, 'the statue of Kongo Zao' (a deity of fierce aspect) and 'the statue of Shitu-kongo-shin (Shu-kongo-shin)' (Buddhist guardian deity) were enshrined as Kyoji, Attendant figures, of the principal image, Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion).
According to Shoso-in Monjo (documents of Shoso-in (Treasure Repository)), these statues were made in 762 and the names of both Kyoji were 'Shinno' (God-King), so that the name of 'Kongo Zao' was seen in a record from the Heian period for the first time.
The original of these statues does not exist now but Shingi (a wooden core) of the 'Kongo Zao statue' still exists, and its figure with the right hand and right leg high up is similar to later Zao Gongen statues.
Bronze Plaque with Line-engraved Zao Gongen' (in Soji-ji Temple of Nishiarai-taishi Shrine, Tokyo Prefecture) (National Treasure) which was excavated at Yoshino, is a bronze plaque with line-engraved Buddhas including Zao Gongen and has an inscription of 1001, so that it is suggested that the iconography of Zao Gongen had been established before around this time.
According to the theory of syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism, it was considered to be the same god as the Emperor Ankan, so that at the time of separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the Meiji period, many shrines which had enshrined Zao Gongen other than Head Temple Kinpusen-ji Temple determined the Emperor Ankan as Saishin, an enshrined deity.
In addition, the Zao Mountain Range, a member of the one hundred biggest mountains of Japan, which lie on the border between Yamagata Prefecture and Miyagi Prefecture, has been the subject of mountain worship from ancient times so that mountaineering ascetics who believed in Shinto-Buddhist amalgamation of Kukai, came to practice ascetic training around the middle of the Heian period.
The name originated from the fact that Zao Gongen was transferred from Zao-do in Yoshino and enshrined in both Kattadake-jinja Shrine on the top of Mt. Zao and Kattamine-jinja Shrine at the foot.
It is said that Kattamine-jinja Shrine was a temple literally named Kinpusen-ji Temple of Shugen-do which was a mixture of Shinto and Buddhism before the Exclusion of Buddhism in the Meiji period.
In addition, it is said that Zao Gongen of Kattadake-jinja Shrine and Kattamine-jinja Shrine face to Kinpusen-ji Temple of Mt. Omine and Mt. Yoshino.
Going further into the past, the following theory has become influential recently.
The origin of 'Zao Gongen' is appeared that the Emperor Jinmu, considered as the first emperor, subverted Yamato (Wakoku) and Nagasune-hiko, the king of Yamato, was killed then Abi-hiko, his brother, escaped to Tohoku to establish the Tohoku Dynasty and enshrine Nagasune-hiko.
It supports the theory that the flower of bamboo hat for Hanagasa-odori in Yamagata Prefecture is 'cherry' and it is originally a festival to celebrate 'Zao Gongen' and that the sacred tree for Zao faith is 'cherry.'
If we search around Mt. Zao or its northern area carefully, a lot of 'Zao Gongen' can still be seen even now, such as a wooden historical Zao Gongen statue with a height of 4 meters enshrined and hidden in a warehouse.
Kimpusen-ji Temple (Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture) - the standing wooden statues of Zao Gongen (important cultural properties)
Features of Zao Gongen statues are similar to those of Myo (warlike and wrathful deities) statues of Esoteric Buddhism, and they usually show Funnu-so (an angry expression, boiling with anger), lifting the right hand and right leg high up and putting the left hand on the hip.
The most obvious characteristic from the point of view of iconography is to lift the right leg high up so that the whole statue is supported only by the left leg.
(There is also a statue with both feet on the ground such as the statue at Koryu-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture).
The principal image at Oku-no-in of Sanbutsu-ji Temple (Nageire-do) in Tottori Prefecture (Heian period, important cultural property) is one of the representative works.
Hachibushu or Tenryu Hachibushu refers to eight deities who guard Buddhism.
The ancient Indian gods such as the fierce god, the war god, the music god and the animal god, before the dissemination of Buddhism, came to believe in Buddhism and transformed to Goho zenjin (good deities protecting dharma).
Summary
Hachibushu means eight species.
For this, there are various theories.
Usually it means the following eight deities based on mainly 'Sharihotsumon-kyo Sutra,' and 'Hoke-kyo Sutra' and 'Konkomyo Saisho-kyo Sutra' as well; Tenbushu (Deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of the six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another), Ryushu (Pre-Buddhist snake or dragon deities), Yashashu (a class of semi divine usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classed with malignant spirits), Kendatsubashu (Gandharva), Karurashu (Garuda), Kinnarashu (Kinnara) and Makoragashu (Mahoraga).
However, the names of the famous Hachibushu statues of Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture are different from those above, and according to the temple legend, they are called Gobujo, Sakara (Shagara), Kuhanda, Kendatsuba, Ashura, Karura, Kinnara and Hibakara.
In addition, Hachibukishu (eight fierce gods) who serve Shitenno (the Four Guardian Kings), are often confused with these Hachibushu because they have similar names to Hachibushu and some of them have the same names but they are different deities basically.
Incidentally, Hachibukishu include Kendatsuba, Bishaja, Kuhanda, Heireita, Naga, Futanna, Yasha and Rasetsu (Rakshasa).
In Jobon (chapter 1, Introductory) of Hoke-kyo Sutra, the names of these Hachibushu are seen as 'nonhuman entities' in addition to 'humans' such as Biku (Buddhist priest), Bikuni (female Buddhist disciple), Ubasoku (upasaka) and Ubai (upasika) (devout men and women lay follower of Buddhism) as the audience.
Ten, Deva

It is said that it eats fragrance and is a guardian god of soma, the alcohol of the gods, as well.
In Buddhism, it is seen a music god of kenzoku (disciples or followers of Taishakuten).

The statues of Hachibushu in Kofuku-ji Temple
As works of the Hachibushu statues in Japan, the statues at former Saikon-do (an image hall situated to the west of a pagoda in the temple grounds) of Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture (Nara period, national treasures) are well known.
Besides them, sometimes Hachibushu are drawn on pictures with other disciples of Shakyamuni, such as Nehan-zu (Nirvana painting), and their statues including Ashura are seen in statues on the north side of the first story of Goju-no-to (five-storey pagoda) of Horyu-ji Temple, which show nirvana of Shaka, but other statues are rarely seen.
Nijuhachibushu, the twenty-eight attendants which are Kenzoku of Senju Kannon (Sahasrabhuja-arya-avalokites 'vara, "Thousand-armed Kannon") (representative works in Japan are statues at Sanjusangendo Temple and those at Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto Prefecture) include statues of Hachibushu.
The Hachibushu statues of Kofuku-ji Temple are made by kanshitsu-zukuri, which is a technique of pasting hemp clothes in layers with lacquer were and had been placed at Saikon-do hall which was abolished later.
Saikon-do was build by Empress Komyo in 734 for the memorial service of her late mother TACHIBANA no Michiyo, and is known that the Shaka triad as the principal image, as well as statues of Bonten and Taishakuten, Hachibushu statues, the statue of Judai deshi (the Ten Chief Disciples of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni) were placed.
Kofuku-ji Temple Mandala picture' in the Kyoto National Museum (from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the Kamakura period, important cultural property) shows that each two statues of Hachibushu were placed at the right and left in the front and rear of the principal image respectively.
The statues at Saikon-do of Kofuku-ji Temple including Hachibushu are interpreted to have been produced based on Konkomyo saisho-kyo (Golden Light Sutra of the Most Victorious Kings) instead of Jobon of Hoke-kyo Sutra.
A summary account of the Hachibushu statues in Kofuku-ji Temple is as follows.
The statue of Gobujo - Shikikukyoten (heaven of the most rarefied form) in the highest grade of Shikikai and Gobujo Goten, a Tenbu of the lower grade.
It is shaped to put on a crown with an elephant's head and an expression like a boy.
The statue of Kofuku-ji Temple is badly damaged and only the head and a part of the upper body are remained (besides this, the right hand of this statue is in the possession of Tokyo National Museum, which was donated by an individual owner in 1904 to the then Imperial Museum).
It seems to be the statue which corresponds to 'Ten' in scriptures.
Among Nijuhachibushu of Senju Kannon's Kenzoku, there is the statue of 'Gobujo Goten,' and some of them are of war gods with a sword in each hand, including in Sanjusangendo Temple and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera Temple.
The statue of Sakatsura - it is shaped as a figure where a snake is wound around from the top of the head to the upper body and it has a sad look on its face like a boy.
This statue is considered to be the statue which corresponds to 'dragon' in scriptures.
However, there is a theory that the state of Sakatsura in Kofuku-ji Temple corresponds to 'Makoraga' instead of 'dragon.'
It appears in the name of 'Sakatsura Ryuo' among Nijuhachibushu.
The statue of Kuhanda - it is shaped in the expression of anger with its hair stood on end and its eyes narrow.
It is considered to be the statue which corresponds to 'Yasha' in scriptures.
It is also said to be Kenzoku of Zochoten, Virudhaka, among Shitenno.
There is no statue which corresponds to Kuhanda among Nijuhachibushu.
The statue of Kendatsuba - it puts on armor and a lion crown.
Both eyes are almost closed.
The statue of Ashura - it is shaped as a figure with three faces and six arms.
The Ashura statue of Kofuku-ji Temple is famous, and often appears in posters and brochures for sightseeing in Nara.
The statue of Karura - the statue of Kofuku-ji Temple wears armor with a bird's head and a human body.
Different from this, the statues of Karura among Nijuhachibushu at Sanjusangendo Temple and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera Temple have wings and blow a whistle.
As the temple legend, the statue of Kinnara - it has a horn on the head and seems to have been made as the statue of Kinnara from the very beginning.
The statue of Hibakara - it is shaped as a somewhat older face with a beard, different from other statues.
It is said to correspond to 'Makoraga' in scripture, but not sure.
There are both Hibakara and Makoraga among Nijuhachibushu, and the former is expressed as the statue of a war god in a common style while the latter is expressed as the statue who plays the Japanese lute with five eyes.
Juniten is a mixture of the twelve deities of 'Ten,' which are Goho Zenshin (good deities protecting dharma) in Buddhism and is given high value in Esoteric Buddhism, as well as Shitenno (Four Guardian Kings).
Origin
Ten' or the image of Tenbu in Buddhism was established by the historical process where the gods in Indian myths and Brahmanism were incorporated into Buddhism and became Goho Zenshin.
Juniten was determined to be the eight Ten which guard the eight directions of north, south, east, west, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest, adding four gods related to heaven, earth, the sun and the moon, and consists of twelve deities of Ishanaten (Isana), Taishakuten (Indra), Katen (Agni), Emmaten (Yama), Rasetsuten (Rakshasa), Suiten (Varuna), Futen (Vayu), Bishamonten (Vaisravana), Bonten (Brahma, Brahman), Jiten (Prithivi), Nitten (Surya, Aditya) and Gatten (Candra).
In Japan it has been shaped since the 9th century during the Heian period.
The direction that each deity guards and each Sanskrit name are as follows.
Directions
Ishanaten (Northeast) (Isana)
Taishakuten (East) (wIndra)

Works in Japan
The major characteristic of Juniten is as 'Gohoshin', a guardian deity of directions.
Most of the works are pictures rather than sculptures and pictures drawn on Kakejiku (hanging scroll) or Byobu (a folding screen consisting of multiple, joined panels) were used as guardian deities of dojo, where important prayers and austerities, and Buddhist ceremonies were held.
The picture of Juniten in the Kyoto National Museum (which was in the possession of To-ji Temple) (later part of the Heian period, in 1127, national treasure) is Kakejiku on which each Juniten is drawn, and is a representative Buddhist picture which has the sensitive and graceful style of dynasty.
This was used at Goshichinichi-no-mishiho (a ritual held at Shingon-in in Imperial Palace to pray for the Emperor's health).
The picture of Juniten at Saidai-ji Temple in Nara (beginning of the Heian period, national treasure) is the oldest Juniten image in Japan, and was drawn in the 9th century and each deity sits on birds and animals such as buffalo and turtle, while each deity in the picture in the Kyoto National Museum sits on carpet.
Many works, in which each Juniten deity was drawn as a standing figure on a pair of folding screens with six panels, remain, and these were used in order to guard dojo such as Denpo Kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma), an important ritual in Esoteric Buddhism.
As a Byobu of Juniten, the example in To-ji Temple, which was drawn during the Kamakura period, is particularly well known.
In addition, Juniten also appears as a member of the Buddhas which make up the Mandala.
Among Ryokai-mandala (mandala of the two realms), Juniten is included in the Buddhas of Saige-in (outer court) on Garbha-mandala (Gekongobu-in).
Moreover, Juniten Mandala, on which Juniten is placed around a Fudo Myo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) image with four arms, is used in anchin-ho, an esoteric rite for achieving peace and security of the state.
The wooden statue at Muryo-ji Temple in Gamagori City, Aichi Prefecture, which is a rare Juniten statue, seems to have been shaped as a part of a cubic diagram of Mandala.
Besides these, there are Juniten masks (latter part of the Heian period, important cultural properties) in the Kyoto National Museum, which were in the possession of To-ji Temple.
At the time of ritual of Denpo Kanjo in the Heian period, people who put on Juniten's masks and costumes appeared in the 'March of Juniten' but it was changed to Byobu of Juniten after medieval times.
Shonyo (December 23, 1516 - September 19, 1554) was a priest of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
He was the 10th head priest of Hongan-ji Temple.
His posthumous name was Kokyo.
He was a grandson of Rennyo and a son of Ennyo (who was not included among successive head priests because he had died before succession from his father Jitsunyo).
His mother was a daughter of Renjun, the sixth son of Rennyo.
In 1525 he became the 10th chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple at the age of 10 due to the death of his grandfather, Jitsunyo, and was placed under the guardianship of Renjun, who was a brother of Jitsunyo and his maternal grandfather.
In 1527, in order to promote friendship between the Hongan-ji religious group and the central government and to achieve peace and security, he approached the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) and became an adopted child of Hisatsune KUJO, a chief adviser to the Emperor.
In 1531, a conflict within the Hongan-ji religious group occurred (it is called the Kyoroku-Tenbun War (Kyoroku-Tenbun Rebellion) including the later incidents until when Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple was burned down), but Syonyo resolved this conflict and made efforts to strengthen the leadership of Hoshu (high priest).
The following year (1532), he mobilized his followers to subvert Motonaga Miyoshi at the request of Harumoto HOSOKAWA, who held the post of Kanrei (shogunal deputy); however, in fear of the power held by Hongan-ji Temple, Harumoto attacked and burned down Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple, which was home to the Hongan-ji Temple school at that time, in cooperation with the Nichiren sect groups and Sadayori ROKKAKU (this incident is known as the Tenbun-hokke Riot).
Shyono, who escaped from Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple, moved to Ishiyama Gobo (branch temple) in Osaka and made Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple the new home of the group.
After that, he made peace with Harumoto by making his first son Kennyo marry Nyoenni, an adopted daughter of Harumoto (the youngest daughter of Sadaijin (minister of the left) Kinyori SANJO. Her eldest sister married Harumoto and her second eldest sister married Shingen TAKEDA), and built rapport with the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to mend the relationship with the central government and promote strengthening of the system of Hongan-ji Temple.
Having learnt his lesson with the Tenbun-hokke riot, he also ordered followers of the Ikko Ikki (League of the Single-Minded, established by members of Jodo-shinshu) school of Buddhism in various places not to riot without good reason.
In 1549 he was given "Sanjurokunin-shu" (Collected Poems of Thirty-six Poets) by Emperor Gonara.
Later, in the days of Shonyo's son Kennyo, the book was to have been given to Sakihisa KONOE, the former chief adviser to the emperor who had worked to bring about peace during the Ishiyama War, but he refused to accept it on the grounds that 'a national treasure should not be given away without good reason,' and the book has been in the possession of Hongan-ji Temple as a national treasure ever since.
In addition, during the days of Shonyo, Hongan-ji Temple began to intervene even more actively on behalf of their followers in the Hokuriku region by acting as a mediator in the Kaga Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Kaga), and to strengthen the control of their followers in the region, they built a Gobo in Kanazawa City in 1546, but they did not fully succeed in their aim during Shonyo's lifetime as a result of a conflict with the Asakura clan.
In 1554 he died at the young age of 39, and his eldest son Kennyo succeeded him at the age of 12.
Junnyo (August 3, 1577 - January 21, 1632) was an individual from the Azuchi-Momoyama period and Edo period.
He was the 12th Monshu (a head priest) of Hongan-ji Temple.
He was the third son of Kennyo, the 11th Monshu, and a brother of Kyonyo.
His imina (a personal name) was Kosho.
Triggered by Junnyo's succession to Monshu, instead of his brother, who was at odds with their father, Hongwan-ji Temple split into east and west.
In the Ishiyama War, his father Kennyo made peace with Nobunaga ODA and departed from Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple to Saginomori of Kii Province in 1580.
After that, Kennyo moved to Osaka Tenma, upon being given the land of a temple by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and moved to Shichijo Horikawa in Kyoto (the present location of Hongan-ji Temple) after being given land again by Hideyoshi again in 1591.
As a result, Junnyo also came to Kyoto and, when Kennyo died the following year (1592), he succeeded to Kennyo's position, becoming the 12th Monshu of Hongan-ji Temple in 1593.
Nishi Hongan-ji Temple claimed that Junnyo's brother Kyonyo was basically at odds with their father, as was evident when he withdrew to Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in 1580 despite his father having given up his resistance to the Oda clan, and he was closely watched by Hideyoshi as well when he succeeded Oda Nobunaga, so it was natural that Rennyo became the next Monshu.
Kenson, the second son of Kennyo (half brother of Kyonyo) supported Junnyo as his guardian, forcing his daughter to marry him.
It is said that succession to the position of Monshu by Junnyo, the third son, was eventually realized when his mother turned to Hideyoshi, who was then a vassal of Nobunaga, for help.
It is said that Junnyo was at odds with his half-brother Kyonyo as well (there is, however, another theory that suggests his mother may have shared the same mother as Junnyo, Nyoshun-ni).
However, after Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, who defeated the Toyotomi family, supported Kyonyo and gave land for a temple in Karasuma Shichijo to Kyonyo in 1602, which led to the establishment of Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple.
For this reason, the Hongwan-ji Temple in Shichijo Horikawa, which Junnyo succeeded, became to be called Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, which led to the east-west split of the Honganji Buddhist Sect.
After that, Junnyo assumed daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order) by Imperial order in 1608 and made efforts to broaden the influence of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, building Tsumura Betsuin branch temple in Osaka and Tsukiji Betsuin branch temple in Edo.
Senju Kannon, sahasrabhuja aaryaavalokitezvara in Sanskrit, is a venerable entity of Bosatsu, Bodhisattva, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
Sahasrabhuja' means 'a thousand arms' literally.
This name is a synonym of Durga, a goddess in Hinduism as well, and Senju Kannon is considered to be a transformed body of Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu, which was established in India under influence of Hinduism.
It is one of Roku Kannon (6 Kannon).
Sanmayagyo Symbol is an opened lotus (lotus flower in full bloom. A pair of shokatsu renge (slightly-opened lotus buds) of Sho kannon (Holy Deity of Mercy)) and renge-jo (on lotus) nyoi hoju (a sacred jewel, said to remove suffering, and capable of granting every wish).
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) (Shuji) is hriiH.
Commentary
In Japanese there are various names such as 'Juichimen Senju Kannon' (Eleven-faced and thousand-armed kannon), 'Senju Sengen Kannon' (Thousand-armed and thousand-eyed kannon), 'Juichimen Senju Sengen Kannon' (Eleven-faced, thousand-armed and thousand-eyed kannon) and 'Senju Senpi Kannon' (Thousand-armed and thousand-elbowed kannon).
The name of 'Senju-sengen' originates from the fact that it has one eye in each palm of a thousand arms.
A thousand arms indicate the vastness of Kannon's mercy and power as endeavors to relieve every living things.
The reason why Kannon Bosatsu have a thousand arms is written in "Senju-sengen Kanzeon Bosatsu Kodaienman Muge Daihishin Darani-kyo Sutra" (Nilakanta (ka) -sutra) translated by Gabon-Datsuma (Bhagavaddharma).
Daihishin Dharani (Great Compassionate Heart Dharani) in this sutra has been recited at Zen sect temples in China and Japan up until the current time.
As one of the Roku Kannon, it is said to provide salvation for the dead in Gaki-do (the Realm of the Hungry Dead), which is one the Rokudo (the six realms of existence).
In addition, it is also said to relieve suffering in hell and control the achievement of various wishes and peaceful birth by showing that there is a benefit of no obstacle (無礙の大用) for relief of all living things.
Names
There are various honorific names of Senju Kannon as above.
Among Senju Kannon statues, there is a statue with 27 faces instead of 11 faces, so that 'Juichimen Senju-sengen Kannon' is not always true.
In addition, the designated name for national treasure and important cultural property based on the Act on Protection of Cultural Properties is unified to 'Senju Kannon.'
In Mandala (Mandala, or a diagram that depicts Buddhist deities according to certain geometric formats and illustrates the Buddhist world view) in Mikkyo, Kannon statues are classified to 'Renge-bu' (Lotus Family).
It means that Senju Kannon is also called 'Rengeo' (lotus king) because it is a king of Kannon, so that the name of Rengeoin (the formal name of Sanjusangendo Temple in Kyoto) originates from this.
Features of Statue
Although there exist both seated statues and standing statues, and statues with a thousand arms actually, generally it has 11 faces and 42 arms (the statue of principal image of Buddha, at Dojo-ji Temple in Wakayama is an exception with 44 arms).
The 42 arms is explained as follows; the 40 hands except two clasped hands in prayer at the front of the breast relieve each of the 25 worlds, that is, '25X40=1,000.'
The '25 worlds' here means 'three realms and twenty-five forms of existence' in Buddhism which is a thought that there are 25 worlds from heaven to hell (it is considered that there are 14 forms in Yokkai (the realm of desire), 7 forms in Shikikai (the realm of form) and 4 forms in Mushikikai (the realm of non-form).
Incidentally, 'Uchoten' means the heaven on the top of Twenty-five forms of existence.
The statue of principal image at Sanjusangendo Temple in Kyoto (seated statue) is a representative work of Tankei, a Busshi (a sculptor of Buddhist statues) in the Kamakura period and is a typical statue with 11 faces and 42 arms.
The two hands among 42 hands are joined in prayer in front of the breast and in the other two hands brought together in front of stomach there is Hohatsu (a bowl used by Buddhist monks for meals, and as a begging bowl) (this is called Hohatsu-shu (hands for Hohatsu)).
In the other 38 hands there are various Jimotsu (the hand-held attributes of a Buddhist image) such as Horin (Dharma-wheel (cakra)), Shakujo (pewter staff) and Suibyo (water jug).
Jimotsu with 38 hands is different from statues and is not necessarily uniform.
In addition, some Jimotsu were often lost through the years or changed to supply materials in later age.
The statue at the main hall of the Toshodai-ji Temple in Nara (standing statue), the statue of principal image in Fujii-dera Temple in Osaka and the statue of principal image in Juho-ji Temple in Kyoto are works which actually expressed a thousand arms.
The statue at Toshodai-ji Temple, which is over 5 m high, has 42 big arms and many small arms (it is said that 953 arms remain) in the spaces between the big arms.
The statue at Fujii-dera Temple has 40 big arms (with no Hohatsu-shu) and 1,001 small arms.
When viewed from the front, the small arms of the statue in Fujii-dera Temple appear to be coming directly out of the body, but they are actually attached to two column supports that stand just behind the statue.
The remaining traces of eyes painted on the palms of the large and small arms of the statue at Fujii-dera Temple demonstrate that the statue once had literally 'a thousand arms and a thousand eyes'.
Faith and Examples of Statues in Japan
While Senju Kannon statues are hardly found in India, there are remains in China such as Longmen Caves from the Tang Dynasty.
In Japan, Senju Kannon began to be worshipped in an early age and it had been shaped into a statue since the Nara period before Kukai transmitted pure esotericism.
It was known that Senju-do hall was built in Todai-ji Temple from 729 to 749 and Senju Kannon statue was placed in its Kodo (Lecture Hall) which does not exist now.
Among existing works in Japan, the statue at Fujii-dera Temple, which is considered to have been made in the middle of the 8th century, is recognized as the oldest work, and the statue at Toshodai-ji Temple is a work from the end of the 8th century to the beginning of the 9th century.
A badly damaged statue of Senju Kannon was discovered in the body of Kitamuki (north-faced) principal image, a hidden Buddhist statue, at Dojo-ji Temple in Wakayama, which seems to be the principal image from the early age of Dojo-ji Temple during the Nara period.
Besides these, Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Sanjusangendo Temple and Kokawa-dera Temple, a pilgrim stamp office of the Saigoku (western part of Japan), are famous for enshrining Senju Kannon.

Risshu sect is one the sects of Buddhism which research and practice commandments.
Risshu Sect in China
Unlike in Japan, learning commandments was necessary for becoming an official priest in China, so that commandments had been researched from ancient times.
It is said that in the period of the Tang Dynasty, Dosen, who founded the Nanzan-risshu sect, completed the study of the commandments and that Ganjin, who learned from Dosen's disciple, transmitted the commandments to Japan, as requested by Japanese priests who had studied in China.
Risshu Sect in Japan
In Japan, commandments were introduced at a comparatively early stage in an incomplete way, so that their significance was not understood fully and they were researched in only a portion of the temples without any Jukai (rituals handing down the precepts).
In 753, Ganjin came to Japan from Tang after six voyages and established Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) at Todai-ji Temple and conferred commandments to the people such as the retired Emperor Shomu and Emperor Shotoku for the first time in Japan.
He later devoted himself to research on the commandments at the base of Toshodai-ji Temple, and this sect still exists today as one of Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara).
Although Ganjin transmitted 'Shibun-ritsu' (Four-Part Vinayapitaka, which explains about regulations and prohibited matters of the priests), Saicho and Kukai in the Heian period did not support it and Kukai put high value on 'Juju-ritsu' (Ten-Reciting Vinayapitaka).
Therefore, the concept on commandments was decentralized so that Risshu sect declined.
In addition, although vowing to follow the precepts was often implemented around Todai-ji Temple and Enryaku-ji Temple, it became only a way to obtain a certificate as an official priest and lost substance.
From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, Shippan and Myoe discussed the renaissance of the commandments, and subsequently Kakujo, Ugon (Yugon), Ensei and Eison implemented vowing to follow the precepts without depending on Kaidan which related to the state in 1236.
While Kakujo emphasized 'Shibun-ritsu' and revived Toshodai-ji Temple as the base of restoration of the Risshu sect later, Enson founded the Shingon Risshu sect around 'Juju-ritsu' of the Shingon sect at the base of Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).
Moreover, Shunjo at Senyu-ji Temple in Kyoto brought back a new Risshu sect from the Southern Sungs.
Therefore, there were three kinds of Risshu sect for 'Hokkyo-ritsu' by Shunjo, Toshodaiji school and Saidaiji school (Shingon Risshu sect) which were called 'Nankyo-ritsu.'
In some cases, these three reformist groups are called 'Shingi-ritsu' (new Risshu sect) and are distinguished from the former 'Kogi-ritsu' (old Risshu sect)
However, as a result, discussions and intercommunion among the three groups of this Shingi-ritsu promoted deepening and restored the Risshu sect, so that it was put to high value during medieval times, and called 'Zen-ritsu' combining the Zen sect and the Risshu sect.
In the Muromachi period it declined again pressed by the Zen sect, but in the Edo period, Myonin, Yuson and Eun appeared and insisted on the renaissance of the commandments.
Besides, in the early Meiji period all Risshu temples except Toshodai-ji Temple belonged to the Shingon sect, but they became independent as the Risshu sect in 1900.
The main dharma is the research and practice of commandments.
Toshodai-ji Temple
A pagoda is a Buddhist building derived from the ancient Indian stupa.
The Sanskrit word 'stupa' was transliterated into Japanese as 'sotoba' and this became abbreviated to 'toba' and simply 'to.'
A stupa is a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics which was transmitted to China during the Han Dynasty and became influenced by the architecture of the wooden buildings of the time.
It was during this period that the word 'to' became used to describe stupa.
The stupa later made its way to Japan.
Many pagodas in Japan including the five-storey, three-storey and two-storey forms are made of wood (such as Japanese cypress).
Despite the wide variation of shapes, all retain the significance of the original stupa.
A large number were constructed using funds donated by Buddhist followers.
To
To' is an abbreviation of 'sotoba' or 'toba' and originally referred to five-storey and three-storey pagodas but came to refer to any tall, narrow structure which tapers to a point at the top such as Tokyo Tower.
The words 'soto' and 'tasoto' often refer to pagodas with two or more storeys such as two-storey, three-storey or five-storey pagodas/
Relatively short pagodas such as three-storey and five-storey varieties are often made of wood but many of the taller ones such as the thirteen-story pagoda at Tanzan-jinja Shrine are made of stone.
There are also small three-storey and five-storey pagodas that are placed in gardens.
The word 'tacchu' originally referred to the 'to no hotori' (grave of a temple founder or high priest) erected by the disciples of a founding priest or Zen temple high priest following his death, or a small temple constructed in the grounds of a larger Zen temple.
Tacchu' as well as the word 'toin' later came to refer to a sub-temple built within the grounds of another temple to serve as the residence of a high priest in his retirement.
The word 'tacchu' is also written using alternative characters.
In Chinese Zen temples, it was originally the practice that the head priest would reside with the monks at the eastern or western so-do hall after he retired.
As time passed and small temples were built within the grounds of larger temples, these became inhabited but these were limited to a single Zen monk per building.
This Chinese custom reached Japan and these buildings came to be seen as permanent sub-temples that served as the graves of individuals, such as the founding priest, who were particularly important to a Zen temple to create the uniquely Japanese concept of the 'tacchu.'
There were also tacchu that acquired their own patron and estate, and were kept running by the disciples.
Kyoso Hanjaku means evaluation of Buddhist scriptures, and was practiced in regions where Buddhist scriptures using Chinese characters were used, including China, for the purpose of evaluating and interpreting Buddhist scriptures based on the height and depth of their contents.
It is also called Kyohan for short.
Shaka preached many teachings during around 45 year period after he attained enlightenment and until he entered nirvana.
These teachings were compiled into scriptures in later years.
After many scriptures had been introduced into China and compiled into Buddhist scriptures using Chinese characters, they were distinguished, according to Chinese-style interpretation of Shaka's teaching, based on their contents and the era of original teachings and monks sought perfect Satori (enlightenment) in unobstructed cultivation of Buddhism from such scriptures.
This is the origin of Kyoso Hanjaku and it was introduced into Japan, Korea and Vietnam as northern-route Buddhism.
Currently, however, it is widely criticized and cited as proof of the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha's teachings because the era of creation of each scripture is specified to a certain extent and the fact that the Mahayana Sutra is not Shaka's direct teaching but one created in later years is well known.
Therefore, classification of the Buddhist Doctrines known as "Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings" (to be mentioned later) is generally rejected as being imperfect or incorrect.
However, even the oldest portion of Theravada Buddhism's tripitaka is assumed to have been compiled only 100 years after Shaka's demise and there exist no scriptures that have been confirmed as those handed down from Shaka's direct teachings.
At that time, however, there were no methods other than Kyoso Hanjaku to distinguish the many scriptures because all Buddhist scriptures, regardless of south route or north route, were believed to be the direct teachings of Shaka.
In this connection, some monks still try to conduct Kyoso Hanjaku under the pretext of the history of creation of scriptures, independent of the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha, from the standpoint that even though many of scriptures do not directly derive from Shaka's teachings, they cannot be completely bogus since each scripture should have been created and developed based on the original Shaka's teachings.
Block of Tibetan Buddhist Scriptures (Tibet, Mongolia, Ching)
In Tibet, the introduction of Buddhism was carried out as a national project during the period from the end of the 8th century to the 9th century and various Buddhist traditions that then existed in India were introduced in one swoop in a short period.
In translating Buddhist scriptures, preparation of the proper Tibetan vocabulary and grammar required for correct translation from Sanskrit was conducted beforehand and as a result, Daizo-kyo Sutra (the Tripitaka) of Tibetan Buddhism are much more streamlined, such as the existence of a single translation of a particular scripture and unified word selection of the same notion used in various scriptures, compared with Buddhist scriptures using Chinese characters.
Under such circumstances, a study of Buddhist scriptures in Tibetan Buddhism was conducted from the viewpoint of how to rationally systematize a group of scriptures which also includes partially contradictory wordings.
In China, the problem concerning which are the real teachings of Shaka arose because Buddhist teachings were highly diversified due to too many scriptures being introduced.
Under such circumstances, it was widely thought that the root of such differences in the contents of scriptures was the difference of the era and contents of Shaka's original teachings and a variety of Kyoso Hanjaku, a method for distinguishing the era of Shaka's preachings as well as judging the supreme teachings among them, were practiced by various sects.
The oldest Kyohan is believed to be the one practiced by Dosho and it is categorized into four kinds as shown below.
Zenjo-horin - Shaka preached to lay believers.
Hoben-horin - Shaka preached to Zraavaka, Pratyekabuddha and Bodhisattva.
Shinjitsu-horin - Shaka preached Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra).
Muyo-horin - Shaka preached Daihatusnaion-kyo Sutra (only first half of Nehan-gyo Sutra (the Nirvana Sutra) translated by Hokken).
Next, Ekan exhorted Kyohan, called the Fivefold Periods.
Shaka preached Shitai Tenporin (literally, spinning the dharma wheel and metaphorically to 'expounding the truth' of Four Noble Truths) at Sarnath.
Shaka preached Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra at various places.
Shaka preached Yuima-gyo (Vimalakirti Sutra) and Bontenyakushi-kyo (Brahmapariprccha Sutra) at various places.
Shaka preached Hoke-kyo sutra at Ryojusen Mountain (Griddhakuta).
Shaka preached Daihatsu Nehan-gyo (the Nirvana Sutra) at a grove of sal trees.
Ekan was believed to have established Fivefold Periods and founded the origin of the Fivefold Periods Kyohan.
Both Dosho and Ekan were the principal disciples of Kumaraju, who translated Hoke-kyo Sutra.
Although there is a difference between them in their interpretation of Nehan-gyo, and Ekan once criticized Dosho, both judged the Nirvana Sutra to be the supreme scripture in their Kyohan.
As far as the Fivefold Periods Kyohan is concerned, that of the Tendai sect is famous today but its origin is the Fivefold Periods as exhorted by Ekan.
Based on this, a variety of Kyoso-hanjaku were practiced.
Therefore, the origin of 'Fivefold Periods Kyohan and Eight Teachings' of the Tendai sect can be traced back to Dosho and Ekan.
Thesis of Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings (Tendai)
Kyohan based on Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings, or the thesis of Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings, is what Chigi (538 - 597) of Mt. Tendai divided Issai-kyo Sutra (complete Buddhist scriptures) into Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings.
Saicho introduced it into Japan.
Nichiren adopted it as the basis of his advocacy that Hoke-kyo Sutra is the supreme scripture.
Fivefold Periods
According to this thesis, Shaka preached Kegon-kyo Sutra (Avatamska Sutra) first but as it was too difficult for people to understand, he preached Agon-kyo Sutra (Agama Sutra) next which was easier.
Shaka, then preached Hodo-kyo Sutra (Vaipulya Sutra) and Hannya-kyo Sutra (Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra) depending on peoples' level of understanding and during the final 8 years, he preached Hoke-kyo Sutra and Nehan-gyo.
As a conclusion, this thesis asserted that Hoke-kyo Sutra, which Shaka finally preached, was the most important teaching.
Based on duration, Eza (place where Shaka preached) and scripture, D are sorted out as follows.

Contents - Shoso (Curds), Zen-kyo (including Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo) that advocates the comparison of 4 teachings of Daizo-kyo, Tsu-kyo (Shared Teaching), Betsu-kyo and En-kyo and the teaching of danka (to scold).
The Period of Hannya-kyo (Prajna)
Duration - 14 years (some assert it was 22 years)
Eza - 16 meetings at 4 places including Ryojusen Mountain nearby Rajagrha in Magadh.
Scripture - Daihannya-kyo (Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra), Kongohannya-kyo Sutra (Diamond Sutra) and Hannya Shin-gyo (Heart Sutra), and so on.
Contents - Jukuso (Butter), Zen-kyo that advocates En-kyo with Tsu-kyo and Betsu-kyo mixing (including Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo) and the teaching of tota (to select).
The Period of Hokke Nehan-gyo (Lotus Nirvana)
Duration - 8 years (1 day 1 night as for Nehan-gyo Sutra)
Eza - 3 meetings at 2 places including Ryojusen Mountain nearby Rajagrha in Magadh (Hoke-kyo Sutra) and under a sal tree along the Ajitavati River in Kushinagar (Nehan -gyo Sutra).
Scripture - Hokke Sanbu-kyo Sutra (The Threefold Lotus Sutra) centered on Hoke-kyo Sutra 28 chapters and Nehan-gyo Sutra.
Contents - Daigo (Ghee), Ton-kyo that advocates En-kyo (no Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo) and the teaching of kaie (to reveal).
However, the above time-series classification was made simply based on the time, descriptions relevant to time and places that are described in scriptures together with their contents, it does not necessarily mean that Shaka actually preached in this order.
In this connection, Nichiren said in his Shugo Kokka-ron (Treatise on protection of the nation); 'The above is a summary of voluminous sutra.
Concerning various sutras of Mahayana and Hinayana other than this, their histories are definitely confirmed and there is a possibility that Shaka preached Kegon-kyo Sutra after Agon-kyo Sutra or he preached Hodo-kyo Sutra and Hannya-kyo Sutra after Hoke-kyo Sutra.
As the meanings of them are analogous, they should be treated together.'
Therefore, attention should be paid to the fact that Shaka preached his teachings taking into account people's patience (ability to listen to or understand his teachings) and as the term taiki-seppo (the best suitable expression of the teaching for the target audience) and Rinki Ohen (the best suitable action according to circumstances) indicate, he preached not necessarily in sequence.
From the viewpoint of the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha as well as the history of scriptures, attention also should be paid to the fact that even Nichiren admitted the history of sutras was not confirmed while he adopted the Fivefold Periods thesis which Chigi had determined.
Therefore, although some members of the current Buddhist community reject the Fivefold Periods thesis as wrong, it cannot be denied completely.
In this connection, Chigi asserted that the content of Nehan-gyo Sutra was almost the same as that of Hoke-kyo Sutra, and its truth had already been clarified in Hoke-kyo Sutra and therefore, it was preached only for the purpose of rescuing people who had been left out from Hoke's rescue.
Based on this standpoint, Chigi further asserted that, rather than separating Nehan (nirvana) and Hoke, he classified them together in the 'Hoke-Nehan period' because Nehan was preached only for one day and one night, while Hoke was preached for 8 years; judging from the content and the place of preaching while the period of preaching from the Kegon-kyo and Hoke-kyo sutras were unknown, however, the Nehan-gyo Sutra are the only teachings that Shaka preached when he was dying.
Gomisosho-no-tatoe (The five flavors, or stages of making ghee, which is said to be a cure for all ailments; it is a Tiantai illustration of the five periods of the Buddha's teaching)
Chigi also linked Fivefold Periods, Kegon, Agon, Hodo, Hannya and Hoke-Nehan, to Five Flavors, fresh milk, cream, curds, butter and ghee, that are advocated by Nehan-gyo Sutra as Gomisosho-no-tatoe.
Nyuso = Kegon
Rakuso = Agon
Shoso = Hodo
Jukuso = Hannya
Daigo = Hoke-Nehan
This is well-known as Daigo-no-tatoe (analogy of Daigo).
However, the above description of Nehan-gyo Sutra solely advocates that Nehan-gyo Sutra is the ultimate and supreme sutra among all sutras and strictly speaking, Hoke-kyo Sutra does not appear in this description.
Precisely, the description of Nehan-gyo Sutra says 'a cow creates nyu (fresh milk), nyu creates rakuso, rakuso creates jukuso (salpis, which is the word origin of Calpis (Japanese milk-based soft drink) and jukuso creates ghee and similarly in the teaching of Buddhism, Buddha creates Junibu-kyo Sutra (the Twelve Divisions of Scriptures), Junibu-kyo Sutra creates Shutara (sutra), Shutara creates Hodo-kyo Sutra, Hodo-kyo sutra creates Hannya Haramitsu (prajnaparamita) and Hannya Haramitsu creates Dainehan-kyo Sutra' (the Nirvana Sutra).
Strictly speaking, therefore, linkage is (presumed to be) as follows.
Nyu = Junibu-kyo Sutra
Rakuso = Shutara
Shoso = Hodo-kyo Sutra
Jukuso = Hannya Haramitsu
Daigo = Dainehan-kyo Sutra
Chigi linked Fivefold Periods and Five Flavors by his intelligent inspiration.
By people belonging to the Buddhist academy, however, much criticism has been raised against his interpretation which judges that Nehan-gyo Sutra is inferior to Hoke-kyo Sutra, asserting that he twisted the argument too much in favor of Hoke-kyo Sutra from his standpoint regarding Hoke-kyo Sutra's superiority.
Eight Teachings
Eight teachings are divided into Kegi-no-shikyo (Shakamuni's four modes of instruction) and Keho-no-shikyo (Shakamuni's four kinds of teaching the content of the Truth, accommodated to the capacity of his disciples).
Kegi-no-shikyo
Kegi-no-shikyo is the categorization of Shaka's teachings based on the form of teaching to guide people (such as rites) with the calling of such form as Gi.
Ton-kyo (ton means immediately and Ton-kyo are the teachings which Buddha preached immediately after he attained Satori regardless of people's patience)
Zen-kyo (zen means gradually and Zen-kyo is the teaching which Buddha preached stepwise from shallow teachings to deep teachings depending on people's patience)
Himitsu-kyo (Its correct name is Himitsu Fujo-kyo and it is the teaching which Shaka preached in order to give indefinite benefits separately (individually) to people whose patience is different while keeping the difference in teachings a secret (confidentially))
Fujo-kyo (correct name is Kenro Fujo-kyo and it is the teachings which Shaka preached in order to give indefinite benefits separately (individually) to people whose patience is different while revealing the difference of the teachings)
These four correspond to Fivefold Periods as Ton-kyo to the Period of Kegon-kyo, Zen-kyo to three periods of Agon-kyo, Hodo-kyo and Hannya-kyo, Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo to a part of Kegon and Agon, Hodo and Hannya and neither Ton-kyo, Zen-kyo, Himitsu-kyo nor Fujo-kyo correspond to the Period of Hoke-Nehan-kyo.
Keho-no-shikyo
Keho-no-shikyo is the categorization of Shaka's teachings based on their contents and such teachings (such as the Four Axioms, and so on) are called ho (teaching).
Zo-kyo (the abbreviated name of Sanzo-kyo (Tripitaka Teaching) that consists of kei (Sutta-pitaka), ron (Abhidhamma-pitaka) and ritsu (Vinaya-pitaka)).
It is also called Hinayana and it advocates the necessity of attaining enlightenment of Kuri (abstract or impracticable theory) in order to renounce worldly desires but as it regards every substance as a part of Ku (mind that is not bound by anything), it is called 'Tanku-no ri' (the theory of only Ku) or 'Henshin no Kuri' (the abstract or impracticable theory of prejudicial truth) because it is a prejudiced truth.
Tsu-kyo (teachings that are similar to Zo-kyo and Betsu-kyo.
It is a primer of Mahayana
It advocates Taikukan which regards the substances of various Ho as Ku, but while clever Bodhisattva attained 'Futanku-no-ri' which contains Chudo-no-myori (profound reasons of moderation) that is not mere Ku from it, stupid Bodhisattva, shomon (Sharavakia) and Engaku (or paccekabuddha, who has come to Bodhi independent of any other person) attained only 'Tanku' which could be attained from Zo-kyo).
Betsu-kyo (unlike Zo-kyo and Tsu-kyo above or En-kyo below, it is the teachings which Shaka separately preached to Bodhisattva only.
While the above two teachings advocate only Kuri, it advocates the three axioms of Ku, Ke (or difference, a though that things exits temporally) and Chu (or totality) but as the three axioms are not united and separated, it is called 'Kakureki-no-sandai' (three separate axioms) and it advocates only discrimination, rather than harmonization, concerning all things.
Although it also advocates the axiom of Chudo (moderation), it is called 'Tanchu-no-ri' (the theory of only Chudo) because what it advocates is mere Chudo that is separated from two axioms of Ku and Ke.
Further, it advocates the three delusions (illusions from imperfect perception, illusion and temptation through the immense variety of duties in saving men, illusions and temptations that arise from failure philosophically to understand things in their reality) and, to renounce them, it advocates the 52 steps of ascetic practices for Bodhisattva.
It further advocates karma of Jikkai (the Ten Realms) but only advocates the border of each realm separately.
In view of the above, Betsu-kyo is deemed an imperfect teaching since it lacks Sandai Enyu (The Perfectly Integrated Three Truths) and Jikkaigogu (Mutual Containment of the Ten Realms)).
En-kyo (the teachings of peace and harmonization.
It is the supreme teachings that advocate the harmonization of three axioms of Ku, Ke and Chu as well as Jikkaigogu).
These four teachings correspond to Fivefold Periods as Zo-kyo to Agon and Hodo, Tsu-kyo to Hodo and Hannya, Betsu-kyo to Kegon, Hodo and Hannya and En-kyo to Kegon, Hodo, Hannya and Hoke-Nehan respectively.
However, Kegon, Hodo, Hannya and Nehan-kyo are Zatsu-En (En-kyo that is mixed with other teachings) that is mixed with Hoben-kyo (tentative teachings that aim to induce people into real teachings) of Zo-kyo, Tsu-kyo and Betsu-kyo and therefore, they are not pure Enkyo.
Only Hoke-kyo is deemed as the one that advocates purely excellent En-kyo independently.
Therefore, Hoke-kyo is called the teachings of 'transcending eight - Daigo' because it transcends the eight teachings of Kegi (Shakamuni's four modes of instruction) and Keho (Shakamuni's four kinds of teaching the content of the Truth, accommodated to the capacity of his disciples).
Sanmon
Another name for the main gate of a Buddhist temple.
The word 'sanmon' (lit. mountain gate) is a remnant from the time when Buddhist temples were originally built on mountains, so that now even such gates of temples located on flatland are referred to as sanmon (please refer to 'Sanmon' and 'shichido garan.').
The term is also commonly used to refer to Buddhist temples in general.
This developed from the above usage (refer to 'Buddhist Temple').
Another name for Enryaku-ji Temple.
Onjo-ji Temple at the base of Mt. Hiei is referred to as the 'Jimon' whereas Enryaku-ji Temple located on Mt. Hiei is referred to as 'Sanmon' (please refer to 'Enryaku-ji Temple' and 'Mt. Hiei').
An abbreviation for the Sanmon School of the Tendai Sect headquartered at Mt. Hiei (refer to 'Tendai Sect').
The name ordinarily given to the 'Nanzenji Sanmon' scene of the second act of the kabuki play "Sanmon Gosan no Kiri" when performed independently (refer to 'Sanmon Gosan no Kiri').
Yamato
The name of a place that existed in Fukushima Prefecture prior to the great merger of municipalities in the Heisei era (refer to 'Yamato County').
Monkan (1278 - November 29, 1357) was a priest who lived from the Kamakura period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts.
Ono Sojo.
Shuon, Koshin.
He was the head priest of Daigo-ji Temple.
In 1302, he was a priest of the Risshu sect at Hannya-ji Temple and learned Shingonritsu at temples related to Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City) such as Hojo Joraku-ji Temple in Harima Province (Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture) and Kasayama Chikuzan-ji Temple in Yamato Province (Kasa, Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).
In 1316, he was given Kanjo (conferred the basic precepts and mystic teachings of esoteric Buddhism) by Dojun of Hoonin, Daigo-ji Temple.
He was also known as a priest of Tachikawa school (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism), the Shingon sect, which was considered as a heretical religion, and he was a priest who renounced the world and relieved the poor with Enkan (Echin).
He was taken into confidence by Emperor Godaigo and assumed the role of the head priest of Daigo-ji Temple and Betto (the superior of a temple) of Tenno-ji Temple.
In 1324, he made the statue of Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri Bodhisattva associated with wisdom, doctrine and awareness) at Hannya-ji Temple and it was brought to light that he had implemented rituals to attempt to destroy the Kamakura Shogunate, by FUJIWARA no Kishi, chugu (the second consort of an emperor) of Godaigo from 1326, so he was arrested in 1331 and was sentenced to deportation to Io-jima Island (Kagoshima Prefecture).
When the Kamakura Shogunate was subverted after the Genko Incident in 1333, he went back to Kyoto, and he also moved to Yoshino in attendance of Godaigo and became Chief Abbot of To-ji Temple and daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order).
He died at Kongo-ji Temple on Mt. Amano in Kawachi Province (Kawachinagano City, Osaka Prefecture) at the age of 80.
He was also considered as having promoted Toshimoto HINO and to mediate between Masashige KUSUNOKI, who was known as Akuto (a villain in medieval times) in Kawachi, and Emperor Godaigo.
Myoha SHUNOKU (1311 - November 9, 1388) was a Zen priest of the Rinzai sect in the Muromachi period.
He was trusted by the Muromachi Shogunate and became the chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple and Rinsei-ji Temple.
Chikaku Fumyo Kokushi.
He was born in Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture).
He vowed to follow the precepts under Soseki MUSO, his maternal uncle.
He became the chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple and advised the Shogunate to build Romon (Sanmon, temple gate) of Nanzen-ji Temple, the first temple of gozan (Zen temples highly ranked by the government), which the Shogunate sponsored.
Together with the Monto (followers) of Mt. Hiei, Onjo-ji Temple, which was in conflict with Nanzen-ji Temple, protested against the construction of the Romon, requesting its removal and Myoha's banishment, and this resulted in the conflict becoming a political issue.
In 1369, Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA, who held the position of kanrei (shogunal deputy), ordered the removal of Romon.
Myoha, who opposed Yoriyuki, resigned as the chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple and retired at Shokoin Temple and later at Unmon-ji Temple in Tango Province.
Yoriyuki asked Myoha to see him for reconciliation, but Myoha rejected this, and Yoriyuki stripped Monto of the title of priest.
Myoha went back to Kyoto after Yoriyuki fell from power in the Koryaku Coup in 1379, and returned to be the chief priest of Nanzen-ji Temple.
Since Myoha had left Tango before Yoriyuki fell from power, he may have been involved in this political change.
He was trusted by the third Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and became the first Soroku (highest-ranking priest of the Gozan, the leader of the Zen sect) on November 27, 1379.
He founded Shokoku-ji Temple and established Gozanha (group of the highest-ranked temples in Zen sect).
He published books called Gozanban (literally, Five Mountains Editions).
In addition, he fostered many disciples, who played roles as diplomatic counselors in the trade between the Ming Dynasty and Japan.
"Shunoku Myoha Chinzo" (Portrait of Myoha SHUOKU) was written by Mincho KICHIZAN and is in the possession of Kogenin Temple.
Segaki is a title of a Buddhist mass.
Or it is called Segaki-e.
As it can be read as 'feeding hungry ghosts' in the kun-doku (the word-for-word translating method from Chinese to Japanese), it means the rites to feed living things who fell into Gaki-do (world of hungry ghosts) specially after their death among Bonpu (unenlightened persons) in the worlds of Rokudo rinne (Rebirth in the Six Worlds) and holding a mass for their spirits.
This Buddhist mass is usually held on July 15 (old lunar calendar) as Urabon festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Soul's Day, around the 15th of July or August, depending on local customs).
In the case of the Obon festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Soul's Day) in Japan, each ancestor's spirit called Oshorai-sama is considered to come back to the Buddhist altar in each house once a year so that people place Bonku (offerings) during the Obon period.
At the same time, there is a custom to place segakidana (rack for carrying the dead), gakidana (shelf for holding a deceased person) or Shoryoma (conveyance for the spirits of the deceased) for hungry ghosts who are wandering in this world as muen botoke (a person who died leaving nobody to look after his (her) grave).
However, Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) does not hold Segaki-e.
In the Soto sect, it is commonly called Urabon-e Segaki, but the title of 'Segaki-e' was changed to 'Sejiki-e' because the high or the low and lord or loon should not be distinguished between the people who feed and those who are fed.
In addition, Segaki is usually held during the period of Urabon, but fundamentally it should not be held only at a specific time (that is, Urabon).
It is said that this has been commonly misconceived because the legends of the honorable priests of Mokuren and Anan (Ananda) were similar (as following).
It is said that Segeki of Mokuren originated from 'Urabon-e-kyo Sutra.'
According to this sutra, when the honorable priest Mokuren, who was one of the Judai deshi (The Ten Chief Disciples of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni) and called the top of divine power, looked for the whereabouts of his late mother, she became skin and bones in Gaki-do and was going through hell.
Mokuren tried to feed his mother by his divine power, but she could neither eat nor drink because not only food but also water were burned out.
Mokuren asked Shaka (Sakyamuni) how to relieve her.
Then, Shaka said to him, 'Your mother is highly guilty. She has not done any favors to others and has been so selfish that she fell into Gaki-do.' and 'Prepare something special and recite sutra on July 15 after many priests finish the 90 days ascetic trainings of rainy season, and pray for her from the heart.'
As soon as Mokuren had done this, immediately, Mokuren's mother was relieved from the suffering of hunger.
This is considered to be the origin of Urabon (However, it is influential that this sutra is a false sutra created later in China).
On the other hand, Segaki of Anan originates from 'Kubatsu Enku Darani-kyo Sutra' (Dharani for Extinguishing the Flaming Preta's Mouths).
When the honorable priest Anan, who was one of the Judai deshi and was called the top ability of Tamon (to hear lots of sutras and to keep good behavior), was practicing meditation at a quite place, a hungry ghost named Enku appeared.
He was an ugly hungry ghost who fell away to a shadow and caught fire from the mouth with thin throat, wild hair and shining eyes.
The hungry ghost said to Anan, 'You will die after three days and undergo rebirth as an ugly hungry ghost like me.'
Anan was surprised at that and asked the ghost to avoid such troubles.
It said, 'If you feed all suffering living things in Gaki-do and hold a mass for the 3 treasures of Buddhism: Buddha, sutras and the priesthood, you will take a fresh lease of life and we will escape from suffering as well.'
However, Anan did not have enough money for that, so that he asked Sakyamuni Buddha for help.
Then, Sakyamuni Buddha said, 'There is a secret spell of Kanzeon Bosatsu (the Goddess of Mercy). If you serve food on a dish and perform Kaji (incantation) by reciting this "Kajionjiki Dharani" (literally, incantation for food and drink), the food will become an immeasurable amount of food for all hungry ghosts to feel full enough, and immeasurable sufferings will be relieved, and you can live longer and get a certificate of Buddhism by that good deed.'
As soon as Anan had done this, immediately, he could take a fresh lease of life and was relieved.
This is said to be the origin of Segaki.
It is said that these two legends were confused and many temples came to hold Segaki during the period of Urabon.
Shingon Risshu sect is one sect which practices the commandments of Vajrayana based on the dharma of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism.
It also has the significance of renaissance of the Risshu sect's sprit, which is one of the Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara).
Founder of the Sect
Kosei Bosatsu Eison of Saidai-ji Temple in Nara City was the restorer.
In addition, it especially regards Kukai as Koso (a founder).
Eison implemented Jukai (handing down the precepts), a procedure which was limited to what had been defined by the state, by himself with Kakujo in the Risshu sect because he criticized the degraded existing Buddhism (vow by oneself and Jukai).
After that he made a clear distinction from Kakujo because of differences in the idea of commandments, but he accepted Kakujo's request to restore Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City), engaged in the restoration of temples such as Hokke-ji Temple and Hannya-ji Temple subsequently, and an placed independent Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) without the permission of the Imperial Court.
Continuously, his disciple Ninsho appeared and built Gokuraku-ji Temple in Kamakura City, showing the wit of propagandism against the people, which Eison could not have achieved fully.
This is the origin of the Shingon Risshu sect, but at that time Eison himself and his disciples tried to restore the Risshu sect as a part of renaissance of the Shingon sect and they identified themselves as the 'Saidai-ji Temple school,' one school of the Shingon sect.
However, at that time it was considered as a new school of the Risshu sect.
Besides, although Eison's activities are generally seen as a reform movement inside old Buddhism, recently there is a theory that it was a new sect beyond the frames of the Shingon sect and the Risshu sect and one of the new Kamakura Buddhism (See the article of Kamakura Buddhism).
His successor Shinku (Shingon Risshu sect) and Ninsho gained the confidence of the Imperial Court and made efforts to broaden the influence of the sect as they made provincial monasteries branch temples for restoration (temple solicitation) by Imperial order.
Activities for temple solicitation led by priests of the Shingon Risshu sect were well recognized because they were strict by themselves and had know-how of temple restoration, which soon promoted the movement of renaissance of other Risshu sects so much so that the Risshu sect, including the Shingon Risshu sect, was criticized by Nichiren as 'Ritsu traitor to the country,' having the same power of influence as the Zen sect and the Jodo sect.
Although it declined temporarily after in the latter part of the Muromachi period, Myonin tried to restore it during the early part of the Edo period and his disciple Jogon used the title of 'Shingon Risshu sect' formally for the first time.
When the Meiji Government organized various sects in 1872, all Risshu sects were incorporated into the Shingon sect because Shingon Risshu sect which was the biggest sect among Risshu sects at that time, originated from the Shingon sect.
After that, schools of the Risshu sect requested independence from the Shingon sect, for example Kocho SAEKI (Hirosumi SAEKI) (the 64th choro (patriarch)) of Saidai-ji Temple carried on a campaign.
Rewarding this movement, schools of the Risshu sect were permitted to become independent from the Shingon sect in 1895, and the Shingon Risshu sect also gained independence from the Shingon sect at that time.
However, some temples which had been Shingon Risshu sect temples before the Meiji period remained as Shingon sect temples without following the independent movement.
After that, the choro of Saidai-ji Temple who is the head priest of Saidai-ji Temple as sohonzan (the general head temple) doubled as the chief abbot of the Shingon Risshu sect as a custom.
Sohonzan: Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City)
Daihonzan (the major head temples): Hozan-ji Temple (Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture)

Shoku (or Nishiyama, 1177 - December 31, 1247) was the founder of the Seizan Jodo sect, Seizan Zenrin-ji School of the Jodo sect and Seizan Fukakusa School of the Jodo sect.
He was a leading disciple of Honen and initially named himself as Gedatsu-bo and later on as Zenne-bo.
Shigo (posthumous name) was Miten or Ganchi kokushi.
He was born eldest son of MINAMOTO no Chikasue, Kaga no Gon no kami (Provisional Governor of Kaga Province), and adopted by Michichika KOGA of naidaijin (Minister of the Interior), who belonged to the Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan), when he was nine years old.
In 1190, when he celebrated his coming of age at 14, he became a monk as a disciple of Honen.
Since then, he studied the secrets of Jodo-kyo (pure land teachings).
He studied under Honen for 21 years until the demise of Honen.
He was known as a bright person who could understand everything once he saw or heard it, and in 1198 he played an important role in checking citations, called Kanmon, in compiling Honen's "Senchaku Hongan Nenbutsu-shu" (the holy writings of the Jodo Sect) and in the following year, he gave a lecture on "Senchaku-shu" at Kanezane KUJO's residence in place of Honen.
In 1204 when Honen submitted "shichikajo kishomon" (Seven Article Pledge) to Shinsho, Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect) and daisojo (high priest), Shoku signed the fourth, and this fact gives evidence of his important position among peer disciples.
After studying under Honen for 23 years, he attained the in-depth doctrine of Jodo-kyo and inherited Endon Bosatsu-kai Bodhisattva Precepts.
From that time, he started studying, by exhortation of Honen, Tendai Learning under Ganren of Hino as well as Daimitsu (esoteric Buddhism of the Japanese Tendai Sect) under Seishun.
When Honen passed away in 1212, he moved from Higashiyama Kosaka to Kitao Ojoin (Sango-ji Temple) of Seizan Yoshimine-dera Temple, which he inherited from Jien, the Tendai-zasu and the daisojo.
From 1215, four years after the demise of Honen, until 1227, just before the Karoku Persecution, he shuttled almost everyday between Ojoin Temple, which was his base, and over 30 places around Kyoto and gave lectures on Shandao's literary works including "Kangyosho" (Commentary on the Meditation Sutra).
The record of the above lectures were compiled as "Kanmon Yogi Sho" in 41 volumes and still exist.
In the Karoku Persecution in 1227, he was exempted from exile along with Shinku (Jodo sect) who was also the leading disciple of Honen.
When he made a pilgrimage to Nara Taima-dera Temple in 1229, he had the honor of seeing "Kangyo mandala" (the picture describing Buddhist Heaven and Pure Land of the Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life)) and since that time, he strived for its circulation.
On February 28, 1243 at Kyoto Nishiyama, he, together with disciples, transcribed including Sanbu-kyo Sutra (three main sutras) to hold a mass and put them in the inner hollow of the statue of Raigobutsu (Amida Buddha coming to welcome the spirits of the dead) (texts found in the inner hollow of the Raigobutsu statue at Yamazaki Dainen-ji Temple).
In the same year, he constructed Kangishinin Temple by the order of Emperor Gosaga and he often went to the Imperial Palace, gave lectures on Seizan-gi (or Kosaka-gi, the teachings of the Seizan school) and bestowed Bodhisattva Precepts.
In 1247, he wrote "Chinkanyojin" (a collection of Shoku's sermon) for Cloistered Imperial Prince Dokaku and "Nyoingosho," which was a Buddhist sermon in Japanese writing, for the empress dowager.
Knowing that his days were numbered, he gave a lecture to his disciples on the crucial points of Bosatsu-kai and "Kanmuryoju-kyo" on December 27, 1247, conducted Tendai-daishi ko (a Buddhist memorial ceremony for Tendai-daishi (or Chigi)) on December 29, gave a lecture on the core points of "Bosatsu-kai Gisho" (Commentary on the Doctrine of the Bodhisattva Precepts) for Myokan of Senyu-ji Temple on the following day, and passed away at the age of 71 on December 31 at Shirakawa Kengoin Temple while dressed in a Daie (or Kujogesa, a robe worn by Buddhist priests) after chanting "Amida Sutra" and putting the palms of his hands together as he performed nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation).
Disciples entombed his body at Seizan Sanko-ji Temple and constructed the pagoda named Kadai-byo.
In 1796, he was bestowed Shigo of Ganchi kokushi by Emperor Kokaku.
Major temples constructed by Shoku are Seizan Ojoin Temple, Kangishinin Temple, Jokyoji Temple and Kengoin Temple, and so on.
Shoku's portrait, known as 'Image of the thinker,' suggests that his Jodo-kyo teaching was quite philosophical.
His literary works are basically divided into two categories; practical parts and theoretical parts.
The former includes "Kanmon Yogi Sho" of 41 volumes, "Kangyosho Tahitsusho" (the records of Shoku's lecture about "Kanmuryoju-kyosho" (the records of Shoku's lecture about Kanmuryoju-kyosho (or Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra) written by Kankyo) of 14 volumes, "Kangyosho Taii" (overview of Kanmuryoju-kyosho (or Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra)) of 1 volume, "Kanmon-gi Soan" (draft about the teachings of Kanmon (contemplating dharmas as void)) of 2 volumes, "Sanbu-kyo Rongiki" (summary of debating about Sanbu-kyo (three main sutras)) of 1 volume, "Sanengi" (teachings about sanen (the Three Types of Karmic Relation with Amida Buddha)) of 1 volume, "Josanryoken-gi" (literally, teachings about the mind in one's concentration and non-concentration) of 1 volume, "Godansho" (Buddhist scriptures about tariki nenbutsu (the spirituality of the other power of Buddhist invocation)) of 1 volume, "Anjinsho Furyaku Anjinsho" (literally, the scripture and the summary about obtaining peace of mind through faith or ascetic practice), "Zenne Shonin Gohogo" (the Buddhist sermon of Zenne Shonin (or Shoku)) of 1 volume, "Shiraki Nenbutsu Hogo" (the Buddhist sermon of Shiraki Nenbutsu (tariki nenbutsu (the spirituality of the other power of Buddhist invocation)) without distraction) of 1 volume, "Jutsujo" (records of dialogue between Shoku and Rensho) of 1 volume, "Chinkanyojin" of 1 volume and "Nyoingosho" of 2 volumes, and so on.
The latter includes "Taima Mandara Chuki" (annotation about Taima Mandala) of 10 volumes, "Kangyo Hiketsu-Shu" (The key points of the Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) of 20 volumes, "Senchaku Mitsu Yoketsu" Senchaku Mitsu Yoketsu (literally, Buddhist scriptures about selecting Buddhism) of 5 volumes, "Shujuhachi-gan Yoshakusho" (literally, commentary about Forty-eight Vows) of 2 volumes, "Shugo Yoketsu" (Buddhist scriptures about ascetic practices) of 1 volume, "Taima Mandara Kushiki" (the method to serve Taima Mandala) of 1 volume and "Taima Mandara Hakko Rongisho" (eight lectures of Taima Mandala) of 1 volume, and so on.
Concerning these literary works included in the category of the theoretical parts, there are two contradictory views on their authenticity.
He had many disciples and among them, Joon, Ryushin, Shonyu and Shoe were collectively called the four schools of Nishiyama because each of them founded their own schools.
Other than the above, Rensho (UTSUNOMIYA Jisshin-bo) was said to have constantly followed Shoku and he compiled his mentor's lectures in "Sekigakubosho" in 2 volumes.
Waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables)
With the awakening to great mercy that embraces me everyday despite my worldly desires, I will powerfully live in the present while thanking for it and repaying the indefinite debt to great mercy.
Mappo-shiso is a kind of Buddhist prediction philosophy under three periods which the period of 1,000 years (also said to be 500 years) after the establishment of Buddhism by Shaka is called Shobo, and the following period of 1,000 years is called Zobo and the following period of 10,000 years is called Mappo and these three periods are considered as different.
It is a view of history on the decline of Buddhism (especially Mahayana Buddhism) and according to it, Buddhism would not be practiced correctly in Mappo since Shaka's teaching would have lost influence.
As the expression of 'it is the end of the world' is said to have been derived from Mappo shiso, sometimes this is understood as equivalent to eschatology but such understanding is wrong (to be mentioned below).
As there are various views on the date of Shaka's death, the period of Mappo is not defined clearly.
Since the medieval age, Mappo shiso has often been understood in Japan as similar to eschatology, which means the end of the world.
However, Mappo shiso solely points to the decline of Buddhism, namely it is the prediction that Buddhism would lose its influence over time and it does not relate to social unrest and natural catastrophe.
Therefore, Mappo shiso does not mean 'the end of the world.'
Although some sutras assert that the decline of Buddhism is accompanied by social unrest and natural catastrophe, such as "Hometsujin-kyo Sutra" (Decline of the Law Sutra), it is generally believed that these are bogus sutras that were created in the later stages of history.
Mahayana Buddhism advocates 'no increase, no decrease' and 'no beginning, no end' as the development of Kuron (theory of Ku (mind that is not bound by anything)).
Further, "Nehan-gyo Sutra" (the Nirvana Sutra) fundamentally denies the pessimistic view on Mappo by advocating that Buddha will reappear in this world in the Mappo period when Buddhism has declined.
Therefore, Mappo shiso is not equivalent to eschatology.
The source of Mappo shiso is the description of "Daijkkyo Sutra" (officially, "Daihododaijikkyo Sutra" (Mahsamnipata sutra)) saying, 'Gedatsu Kengo (Age of enlightenment) will remain solid for 500 years after my death, Zenjo kengo (the age of meditation) will remain solid for the following 500 years, Dokuju tamon kengo (the age of reading, reciting, and listening) will remain solid for the following 500 years, Tazo toji kengo (the age of building temples and stupas) will remain solid for the following 500 years and in the following 500 years, there will be disputes concerning my teaching and correct teaching will be forgotten.'
In essence, there will be disputes among Buddhists and correct teaching will be forgotten in the period of the final 500 years.
In China, Mappo shiso became prevalent during the era of the Sui and Tang Dynasties and it is closely related to the establishment of Sangai-kyo (Three Stages Sect) or Jodo-kyo (Jodo (Pure Land) sect).
Its early example is seen in 'Ryusei Ganmon' which was written by Eshi, the second founder of the Tendai sect, during the period of Northern Ch'i and Chen (southern dynasty) and the Stone Sutra Project at Fangshan, which had been continuing for over 1,000 years since the period of the Sui dynasty, was also based on Mappo shiso.
In Japan, it became a reality in the Heian period.
Especially, the year of 1052 was deemed as the first year of Mappo and many sutra mounds were built since people were scared.
In this period, the warrior class was increasing its power while regency of nobility was declining and people's anxiety was growing due to the unstable and dangerous society.
Buddhism society also deteriorated due to corruption at many temples, including the Tendai sect, and the emergence of priest soldiers.
As the Buddhist prediction of Mappo coincided with the real social situation, people's anxiety for real society deepened and they became addicted to pessimistic philosophy in order to escape from such anxiety.
In the Kamakura period, Honen of the Jodo sect and Shinran of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) called for, based on Mappo shiso, repeating the name of Buddha in order to be able to go to Amidanyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) at Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (The West Pure Land (of Amida Buddha)) after death.
Nichiren also called for hokke-ichijo (the doctrines called the Single Vehicle of the Lotus) in the same period.
However, Dogen, the founder of the Soto sect, denied Mappo shiso asserting that there were some dull disciples who committed evil deeds while Shaka was in life and people might use Mappo as an excuse for not doing ascetic training.
Ryokai-mandala is a mandala which visually depicts the truth and the state of enlightenment that is advocated by Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana), principal Buddha in Esoteric Buddhism.
Mandala is the one where many 'Buddha,' including Dainichi Nyorai, are arranged in accordance with a certain fixed order and two mandala, namely Garbha-mandala (also called Taizokai-mandala) and Vajradhatu-mandala, are collectively called Ryokai-mandala or Ryoubu mandala.
Other than the ones which depict the individual image of Buddha in paintings, some depict one Buddha symbolically by one Sanskrit character (a kind of letter which was used for writing Sanskrit).
Garbha-mandala (Daihitaizosho mandala) is drawn based on Esoteric Buddhism scriptures called 'Daibirushana Jobutsu Jinbenkaji-kyo Sutra' (Mahavairocana Sutra) and Vajradhatumandala is drawn based on Esoteric Buddhism scriptures called 'Kongocho-kyo' (Vajrasekhara Sutra).
Dainichi-kyo Sutra (Mahavairocana Sutra) is believed to have been established in India in the middle of the 7th century and it was translated into Kanji characters (translated into the then Chinese language) around 725 in the early 8th century by Zenmui (683 - 735), a native Indian monk, along with his disciple Ichigyo (683 - 727).
On the other hand, Kongocho-kyo Sutra is believed to have been established in India during the period from the end of 7th century to early 8th century and was translated into Kanji characters around the same time with the translation of Dainichi-kyo Sutra by Kongochi (671 - 741), a native Indian monk, along with his disciple Fuku (705 - 774).
Although the volume of Kongocho-kyo Sutra is so huge since it compiled all the teachings that Dainichi Nyorai advocated on 18 various occasions, collectively called Jyuhachi-e, the one which Kongochi and Fuku translated is the teachings advocated on the first occasion, called Sho-e, only.
The teachings at Sho-e are called Shinjitu Sho-gyo Sutra (attva-samgraha).
At any rate, despite the fact that both 'Dainichi-kyo Sutra' and 'Kongocho-kyo Sutra' share Dainichi Nyorai as their common principal Buddha, these two are scriptures of different lineage which were established independently in different regions of India at different times and were introduced into China separately.
It is presumed that Eka (746 - 805), a monk in the Tang dynasty period and who was Kukai's mentor, integrated the teachings of two scriptures into Ryokai-mandala.
As Eka thought it impossible to orally transmit the in-depth teachings of Esoteric Buddhism, he made a Tang painter draw Ryokai-mandala and gave it to Kukai.
Kukai took back such mandala when he returned to Japan in 806 after finishing his study in Tang.
Although the originals which Kukai took back were lost, a copy which is believed to be quite similar to the original is preserved at Jingo-ji Temple in Kyoto, known as national treasury Ryokai-mandala (commonly called Takao-mandala).
Mandala at Jingo-ji Temple is not a colored one but one drawn with ground gold and silver on a woven purple material.
Garbha-mandala is called Daihitaizosho mandala to be precise and although the term that indicates 'world' is not included in the original language, it has been called 'Taizokai mandala' from long ago in tune with Vajradhatumandala,.
The mandala is divided into 12 parts of 'in' (sections).
What is located in the center is 'the central eight-Petal Court' and Taizokai Dainichi Nyorai (who is in a posture of 'Hokkai Join' (Dharma-realm meditation mudra) folding both hands in front of the belly) is sitting on the center of a lotus flower with 8 petals.
Around Dainichi Nyorai, all 8 statues, namely 4 of Nyorai (Hodo (Ratnaketu Tathagata), Kaifukeo (Samkusumitaraja), Amida Nyorai (or Muryoju, Amitabha Tathagata) and Tenkuraion (Divyadundubhimeghanirghosa)) and 4 of Bosatsu (Fugen bosatsu (Samantabhadra Bodhisattva), Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri), Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Buddhisattva) and Miroku Bosatsu (Buddha of the Future, Bodhisattva of the Present), are depicted.
As for the naming of mandala, both Taizokai-mandala and Garbha-mandala are used in Japan but Motohiro YORITOMI, a researcher of Esoteric Buddhism, wrote in his book titled "Architectures of mandala-centering on mandala at To-ji Temple" as 'the name of mandala were created in consideration of both Dainichi-kyo Sutra and Kongocho-kyo Sutra, collectively called Ryobu Sutra and both are the source of mandala, and Kukai used only this name (note: Ryobu-mandala),' 'because Kongocho-kyo Sutra clearly uses Vajradhatumandala, Dainichi-kyo Sutra does not use the name of Taizokai-mandala though it uses Daihitaizosho mandala or Garbha-mandala.'
Motohiro YORITOMI further asserts that with the development of Tendai Esoteric Buddhism (Daimitsu) thanks to Ennin, Enchin and Annen, the term of 'Taizokai' (the Womb Realm) was widely used in the text for prayer and austerities and as a result, the terms of Ryokai-mandala and Taizokai-mandala came into use.
The central eight-Petal Court is surrounded by Henchi-in, Jimyo-in, Shaka-in (Court of Shaka Nyorai), Kokuzo-in (Court of Kokuzo Bosatsu (Akasagarbha Bodhisattva), Monju-in (Court of Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri)), Soshituji-in, Rengebu-in, Jizo-in (Court of Jizo Bosatsu (Jizo Bodhisattva)), Kongoshu-in and Jogaisho-in in a concentric fashion and Gekongobu-in, also called Saige-in, is located at the outer circumference that encircles all of the above.
This suggests the movement from the inner side to the outer side and represents the transformation of Dainichi Nyorai's abstract wisdom into practice in the real world.
Further, Garbha-mandala should be seen by dividing it into three blocks, namely center, right and left block.
The center block represents the world of Dainichi Nyorai's state of enlightment while Rengebu-in (Kannon-in), whose principal statue is Shokanjizai Bosatsu (Kannon Bosatsu), is located on the observers' left (south in terms of direction) and Kongoshu-in (Kongobu-in or Satta-in), whose principal statue is Kongosatta, is located on the observers' right (north in terms of direction).
It is believed that Rengebu-in represents Nyorai's 'mercy' and Kongoshu-in represents Nyorai's 'wisdom' respectively.
While each block of Garbha-mandala is called 'in,' the term of 'E' is used in the case of Vajradhatu-mandala and it consists of Ku-e (nine e), namely Jojin-e, Samaya-e, Misai-e, Kuyo-e, Shiin-e, Ichiin-e, Rishu-e, Gozanze-e and Gozanze Samaya-e.
This should be understood as the aggregate of 9 mandala rather than 9 blocks.
The principal statue of Jojin-e, which is located in the center, is Kongokai Danichi Nyorai (who is in a posture of 'Chiken-in' (the knowledge-fist mudra) with wrapping the forefinger of left hand by the fist of right hand).
Ashuku Nyorai, Hosho Nyorai (Ratnasambhava, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas), Amida Nyorai and Fukujoju Nyorai (Amoghasiddhi, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas) are located at the east, south, west and north of Dainichi Nyorai respectively (Dainichi, Ashuku, Hosho, Amida and Fukujoju are collectively called Kongokai-gobutsu or Gochi-nyorai).
At the east, south, west and north side of each Nyorai, Bosatsu that are closely related to each Nyorai, called Shishingon Bosatsu (Four Attendant Bodhisattva), are located.
Samaya-e, Misai-e and Kuyo-e have almost the same composition as that of Jojin-e located in the center and it is no mistake that Shiin-e is the simplified version of the above and Ichiin-e is the one which omits other Buddha than Dainichi Nyorai.
The principal statues of Rishu-e, Gozanze-e and Gozanze Samaya-e, which are located at the right side of mandala, are not Dainichi Nyorai but Kongosatta for Rishu-e and Gozanze Myoo (Trailokya-vijaya) for the other two.
Kongosatta, who is counted as one of the Bosatsu, and Gozanze Myoo, who has a fierce look, are believed to be the reincarnation of Dainichi Nyorai after attaining the state of enlightment and this depiction represents the belief that everything derives solely from Dainichi Nyorai.
It is perceived that while Garbha-mandala grasps the truth as matter of the real world from practical aspects, Vajradhatu-mandala grasps the truth as the matter of spiritual world from theoretical aspects.
Godai Bosatsu are a kind of combination of Bosatsu (those who are engaged in ascetic training in pursuit of the truth and enlightment) that are objects of worship and construction of statues in Buddhist society.
This is the combination of principal Bosatsu, picked up from many Bosatsu depicted in Ryokai-mandala (Vajradhatumandala), which is valued by Esoteric Buddhism, but there is no prominent work other than the statues at To-ji Temple in Kyoto City, as mentioned below.
In the Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple) in Kyoto, there is a three dimensional Mandala, which consists of 21 statues, that was made by the initiative of Kukai.
Those statues enshrined at the Lecture Hall are categorized into the Nyorai (Tathagata) group, the Myoo (vidya-raja) group and the Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) group respectively.
Kongokai-gobutsu (Gochi Nyorai (Five Wisdom Nyorai, Tathagatas)), of which the principal statue is Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana), is enshrined at the center of the Hall, Godai Myoo (Five Great Myoo), of which the principal statue is Fudo Myoo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings), is enshrined on the observers' left (west) and Godai Bosatsu is enshrined on the observers' right respectively.
Godai Bosatsu enshrined at the Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple consist of 5 Bosatsu statues, namely Kongouharamitsu (Vajraparamita), Kongosatta (Vajrapani, the Diamond Being), Kongoho Bosatsu (Vajraratna Bodhisattava), Kongoho Bosatsu (Vajragarbha Bodhisattava) and Kongogo Bosatsu (Vajrakarma Bodhisattava).
Many Gobutsu (Gochi-nyorai) and Godai Myoo are seen throughout Japan but Godai Bosatsu which combine Kongouharamitsu, Kongosatta, Kongoho Bosatsu, Kongoho Bosatsu and Kongogo Bosatsu are only rarely enshrined at temples other than To-ji Temple and its authority is also unknown.
It is commonly believed that Kukai created Godai Bosatsu by himself based on Kongocho-kyo Sutra (or Vajrasekhara Sutra, one of the basic sutra of Esoteric Buddhism) and Nio-kyo Sutra (or the Sutra of Benevolent Kings, a sutra that advocates guarding the nation by Buddhism), but there is also a view that it is traceable to Esoteric Buddhist art during the period of the Tang Dynasty in China.
Among Godai Bosatsu at To-ji Temple, Kongoharamitsu is the head Bosatsu of 'Shiharamitsu' (four paramita) placed at the east, west, south and north of Dainichinyorai in Vajradhatu Mandala.
According to Vajradhatu Mandala, Kongosatta is the head of the Shishingon Bosatsu placed around Ashuku-nyorai at the east and similarly Kongoho Bosatsu, Kongoho Bosatsu and Kongogyo Bosatsu are the heads of Shishingon Bosatsu (Four Attendant Bodhisattva) placed around Hosho Nyorai (Ratnasambhava) at the south, Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) at the west and Fukujoju N-nyorai (Amoghasiddhi) at the north, respectively.
From the above, it is obvious that each of the Godai Bosatsu corresponds to one of the Gobutsu.
The Sanrinshin (the three wheel-embodiments) theory of Esoteric Buddhism advocates that 'Buddha' has three figures called Jishorinjin (embodiment of the wheel of own-nature), Shoborinjin (embodiment of the wheel of the true Dhara) and Kyoryorinjin (embodiment of the wheel of injunction).
According to this theory, Jishorinjin represents the truth and the state of enlightment itself and corresponds to Gobutsu, Shoborinjin represents the one preaching the truth and corresponds to Godai Bosatsu and Kyoryorinjin represents the one forcibly guiding people who cannot be educated by preaching and corresponds to Godai Myoo, respectively.
Statues enshrined at the Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple make up a three dimensional mandala that represents such Esoteric Buddhist philosophy in the form of three dimensional sculptures.
Tenbu (deva in Sanskrit) means deities of Buddhism.
The origin of most of them are deities of Brahmanism in ancient India and later on, they were introduced in Buddhism and became Goho Zenshin (good deities protecting dharma), guardian deities of Buddhism.
Ten (deity of heavenly realm), Tenbu-shin (Tenbu deity).
While Tenbu is sometimes simply referred to as Ten, the world where Tenbu resides in is also translated as Ten (Buddhism) (devaloka) and these two are often confused in Chinese character using regions.
Although the term of deva in Sanskrit means 'deity,' it was translated as 'Ten' in China and the Japanese language followed such translation.
The Chinese character of 'Bu,' which makes up the term of 'Tenbu' together with the Chinese character of 'Ten,' doesn't have a significant meaning other than 'division' or 'group.'
Therefore, simply referring to as 'Ten' ought to be enough for understanding but in Japanese, the term 'Tenbu zo' (image of Tenbu) has been traditionally used instead of 'Ten zo' (image of Ten).
The term of deva is also translated as Tenjin (heavenly deities) or Tennin (heavenly beings), but in this case, the shades of meaning are different to a certain extent.
Brahmanism deities in ancient India, the roots of deities of Tenbu, include a wide variety of deities ranging from the deity of universe creation to those of evil spirits or demons.
These deities have various appearances and nature including male deities (Bishamonten (Vaisravana), Daikokuten (Mahakala), and so on), female deities (Kisshoten (Laksmi), Benzaiten (Sarasvati, Buddhist goddess of music, learning, eloquence, wealth, longevity, and protection from natural disasters), and so on), type of kishin (nobles) (Bonten (Brahma, a major Hindu deity thought to be responsible for creating the world)), type of tennyo (a heavenly maiden) (Kisshoten), type of rikishi (strong men) Kongo Rikishi (protector deities) and type of busho (Japanese military commander) (Juni Shinsho (the twelve protective deities)), and so on.
Buddha' in broad terms that are the target of worshipping and making sculptures in Buddhism are generally categorized into four groups, namely 'Nyorai-bu' (group of Tathagata), 'Bosatsu-bu' (group of Bodhisattva), 'Myoo-bu' (group of Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) and 'Tenbu' (group of protesters of Buddhist laws).
Nyorai' is equivalent to 'Buddha' and means 'those who have attained enlightment,' 'Bosatsu' means those who are engaged in ascetic training in pursuit of attaining enlightment and under Exoteric Buddhism, Myoo-bu is not included basically because it holds Jikkai (the Ten Realms) theory.
On the other hand, Esoteric Buddhism holds Sanrinshin (the three wheel-embodiments) theory which asserts that Buddha has three figures of Jishorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of own-nature), Shoborinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of the true Dhara) and Kyoryorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of injunction) and according to this theory, 'Myoo' is considered as Kyoryorinjin, the incarnation of Nyorai, that forcibly guides people who cannot be educated by preaching only.
Therefore, many Myoo sculptures have fierce facial expressions called hunnu.
In contrast with deities belonging to the above three groups, those belonging to 'Tenbu' carry the connotation of a guardian deity of Buddhism or a deity of fortune and many of them are the target of worship seeking worldly divine help.
Deities Belonging to Tenbu
Principal deities belonging to Tenbu are Bonten, Taishakuten (Sakra devanam Indra), Shitenno (four guardian kings) that consists of Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra), Zochoten (Virudhaka), Komokuten (Virupaksa) and Tamonten (Vaisravana) (Bishamonten (Vaisravana)), Benzaiten, Daikokuten (Mahakala), Kisshoten, Idaten (Kitchen God, Protector of Monasteries & Monks) Marishiten (Goddess of Wealth & Warrior Class), Kangiten (Nandikesvara, Ganesh in the Buddhist pantheon), Kongorikishi, Kishimo-jin (Goddess of Children) (Kariteimo), Junishinsho, Juniten (twelve deities), Hachi Bushu (or Eight Legions, Protectors of Buddhist Teachings) and Nijuhachi Bushu (The twenty-eight attendants of Senju Kannon), and so on.
Shitenno, Hachi Bushu, Juniten, Junishinsho and Nijuhachi Bushu are known as the group of deities that aim to enhance the power of protecting Buddhism as guardian deities by gathering several deities.
These deities are enshrined in various places, for example at both sides of a temple's entrance gate, nearby Honzon (principal image of Buddha) or around Butsudan (Buddhist altar) but in the case of Bishamonten and Benzaiten, they are often enshrined as Honzon and are the target of worship.
Mandala (Sanskrit: mandala) means works that express sanctuary, Buddhahood and/or the world view of Buddhism visually and symbolically by means of statutes of Buddha, symbols and characters (especially those of Esoteric Buddhism).
Chinese character of 曼陀羅 is also used instead of 曼荼羅 (mandala).
Mandala originated in ancient India and was introduced into central Asia, China, Korean Peninsula and Japan.
In the 21st century, a lot of mandala works are being produced in Tibet and Japan, and so on.
The uniform name of mandala works designated as important cultural properties is '曼荼羅' in Japan, the word of '曼荼羅' is to be used in this column.
曼荼羅' or '曼陀羅' expresses the Sanskrit pronunciation of मण्डल in Chinese characters and these Chinese Characters themselves have no particular meaning, and ('荼' (da) is a different Chinese character from '茶' (cha)).
The meaning of मण्डल is usually explained as follows.
As मण्ड (maṇḍa) means 'real nature, quintessence or essence' and ल (la) means 'have' respectively, मण्डल means 'something that has the essence.'
On the other hand, since मण्डल has the adjective meaning of 'round' and the Chinese character 円 that means round has also the meaning of perfectness and peacefulness, some people assert that this is the word origin of mandala and in China, mandala is sometimes called 円満具足 (peacefulness and content).
When inviting deities, people in ancient India painted round or square magic squares and mandala with colored sand on a dirt mound, and exercised secret arts.
Although old works do not exist because they were painted on dirt mounds with colored sand, this practice still remains in Tibet as part of ascetic training on the occasion of rites or festivals.
Although the term 'mandala' is broadly interpreted in English as the cosmology in Hindu and other religions, it usually means paintings, and so on, that express the world view of Buddhism in Japanese.
Mandala' means Esoteric Buddhism mandala in the narrow sense, but in Japan, there are many works called 'mandala' other than those of Esoteric Buddhism, such as 'Jodo Mandala' which expresses Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (Western Pure Land) where Amida Nyorai (Buddha of Paradise) resides and 'Suijaku Mandala' of Shinto Religion, and their contents and styles of expression are also so diversified that it is difficult to define in a word what should be regarded as 'mandala.'
Esoteric Buddhism mandala works have geometric composition and all statues are painted as frontal views but they do not express three dimensional scenery and perspective.
However, all mandala works are not necessarily works that express such abstract space since Jodo mandala works express three dimensional space and many of the Shinto Religion mandala works express real scenery from the shrines' holy precinct.
The common characteristics of all mandala works are (1) they are composed of plural elements (Buddhist statutes, and so on) (2) these plural elements are not arranged at random but are arranged based on certain rules an/or meanings.
Esoteric Buddhism paintings that express a single Buddhist statute are not called mandala.
In a nutshell, 'mandala' is a painting that combines plural elements and express a certain religious world view as a whole.
There are a wide variety of mandala works according to their forms and uses.
Esoteric Buddhism mandala works are divided into the 4 categories shown below according to their forms (appearances).
Great Mandala - the one that express the statutes of Dainichi Nyorai (Cosmic Buddha) and other Buddha by means of painting.
This is what people usually imagine when they hear the term 'mandala.'
Samaya Mandala - the one that expresses various Buddha by means of the symbols that represent them, instead of painting them directly.
Instead of various Buddha, things like Vajra (weapons that defeat worldly desires), renge (lotus flowers), swords and bells are painted.
These things are called 'Samayagyo Symbol' and they are the symbols of each Buddha's enlightenment and actions.
Ho Mandala - the one that expresses a Buddha symbolically by means of a single letter (Sanskrit character, bonji (Siddhaṃ script)), instead of painting him directly.
It is also called 'Shuji Mandala' (Seed-Syllable Mandala) as a character that represents Buddha, and is called shuji in Buddhism (Esoteric Buddhism).
Katsuma Mandala - 'Katsuma' means 'actions or effects' in Sanskrit.
Katsuma Mandala is the one that expresses mandala by means of three dimensional statutes (sculptures), instead of plane paintings or symbols.
The mandala enshrined at Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple in Kyoto, which consists of 21 Buddhist statutes with Dainichi Nyorai situated in the center, was produced in accordance with the initiative of Kukai and is regarded as a kind of katsuma mandala.
According to the classification of mandala works based on contents, there exist Besson mandala (mandala of individual deities) in Esoteric Buddhism besides Ryokai Mandala (mandala of the two realms) that are the basis, and there are Jodo Mandala, Suijaku Mandala and Miya Mandala (literally Shrine Mandala) in other sects than Esoteric Buddhism.
Ryokai Mandala - It is also called 'Ryobu Mandala' and consists of 2 kinds of mandala, i.e. 'Vajradhatu Mandala' and 'Daihitaizosho Mandala' (mandala born of the womb of great compassion).
Vajradhatu mandala' and 'Daihitaizosho Mandala' were created based on 'Kongocho-kyo Sutra' (Vajrasekhara Sutra) and 'Daibirushana Jobutsu Jinbenkaji-kyo Sutra' (Mahavairocana Sutra), and both are the fundamental scriptures of Esoteric Buddhism, respectively and in these 2 kinds of mandala, many statutes of Buddha are arranged in a fixed order with Dainichi Nyorai, the fundamental Buddha of Esoteric Buddhism, situated in the center.
It represents Esoteric Buddhism's world view symbolically.
As for details, refer to the column of 'Ryokai Mandala.'
Besson Mandala - Unlike Ryokai Mandala, it is the one in which other statutes of Buddha than Dainichi Nyorai are situated in the center and is used as a principal image in the prayer for particular purposes such as peace of state and recovery from disease.
The purposes of prayer are normally categorized into 4 kinds, i.e. prosperity, protection, acquiring love and subduing demons.
Prosperity is the prayer for continuation of good things like longevity and/or good health, protection is the prayer for removing or allaying misfortunes like disease and/or disaster, acquiring love is the prayer for a good marital relationship and subduing demons is the prayer for beating back enemies respectively.
In this category, there exists Butsugen Mandala (literally Buddha-Eye Mandala), Ichijikinrin Mandala (One-Syllable Golden Wheel Mandala), Sonsho Mandala (Mandala composed of holy spirits of Mahavairocana's parietal region), Hokke Mandala (lotus mandala), Horokaku Mandala (Jeweled Pavilion Mandala) and Ninnogyo Mandala (the Sutra of Benevolent Kings Mandala), and so on.
Jodo Mandala - Jodo (pure land) means the sanctuary or perfect land where each Buddha resides, such as jodo of Miroku Buddha (Maitreya) and jodo of Yakushi Nyorai (the Healing Buddha), but when simply referring to 'jodo,' it usually means Saiho Gokuraku Jodo of Amida Nyorai.
Jodo Mandala is the one that concretely expresses the image of Amida jodo which is advocated in 'Kanmuryo Jukyo Sutra' (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) and other scriptures.
While these works are called 'jodo henso-zu' (the picture describing Buddhist Heaven and Pure Land) in China, they are called mandala in Japan.
Based on patterns and contents, Jodo mandala works in Japan are categorized into 3 kinds, i.e. Chiko Mandala, Taima Mandala and Seikai Mandala, and these are collectively called Jodo Sanmandala (three Jodo mandala).
Suijaku Mandala - The philosophy which advocates that deities of the Japanese Shinto Religion are various Buddha from Buddhism that appear tentatively in different figures, is called Honji-Suijaku Setsu (Honji-Suijaku thesis).
According to this thesis, various Buddha, which are the original figures of Deities, are called 'Honjibutsu' (Honji Buddha) and deities originating from Honjibutsu are called 'Suijakushin' (Suijaku deity).
The works that express the deities of a particular shrine in the style of mandala, while assuming them to be Honjibutsu or Suijakushin, are called Suijaku Mandala.
There also are many kinds of Suijaku Mandala works such as those expressing only Honjibutsu, those expressing only Suijakushin and those expressing both.
Typical examples are Kumano Mandala (Devotional paintings of the three shrines of Kumano), Kasuga Mandala (Mandala form that sprang from Kasuga-Taisha Shrine) and Hie Sanno mandala (Mandala having to do with Hie Sannosha Shrine).
Each of them depicts the enshrined deities of Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha) in Wakayama Prefecture, Kasuga Taisha in Nara Prefecture and Hiyoshi Taisha, which is Chinju (local Shinto deity) of Mt. Hiei, respectively.
Miya Mandala - Some works that depict neither Honjibutsu nor Suijakushin but depict the scenery of a shrine's holy precinct are also called 'Mandala.'
These works are considered to have depicted a shrine's holy precinct as sanctuary or jodo.
Other than the above, there exists many kinds of painting works that are called 'mandala' regardless of being those of Buddhism or the Shinto Religion.
Moji Mandala - It was invented by Nichiren and depicts chants and various Buddha by means of letters (Chinese characters) instead of paintings.
This is called Ita Mandala (board mandala) or Hige Mandala (beard mandala) because of its distinguishing characteristics of a long line drawn from the title lettering situated in the center.
Sects belonging to Fujimon school including the Nichiren Shoshu sect, enshrine Nichiren's mandala as their principal image (Nichiren Shoshu sect calls it Honmon no kaidan no dai gohonzon).
In other sects like Icchi school, mandala are not necessarily their principal image.
Tibetan Mandala - A mandala of Tibetan Buddhism.
There exist many kinds of mandala works including those that depict various Buddha or rokudo-rinne (Rebirth in the Six Worlds) and Sand mandala which was produced with colored sand is also well known.
Soho TAKUAN (January 3, 1574 - January 27, 1646) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect who was active in the Edo period.
He was the juji (chief priest) of Daitoku-ji Temple.
He was born in Izushi in Tajima Province (present-day, Izushi-cho, Toyoka City, Hyogo Prefecture).
He was once exiled to Dewa Province because of his involvement in the Shie Incident but was later pardoned and subsequently founded Tokai-ji Temple (Shinagawa-ku Ward, Tokyo) in Edo.
He was familiar not only with painting, calligraphy and poetry but also with Chanoyu (the tea ceremony) and he left many bakuseki (writing, especially of a Zen monk).
Although he is widely believed to be the inventor of takuanzuke (pickled daikon radish), there are many views on this subject (refer to the column on takuanzuke).
On January 3, 1574, he was born as the second son of Tsunanori, Noto no kami (the governor of Noto Province), AKIBA in Izushi, Tajima Province.
His father, Tsunanori AKIBA, was a senior vassal of Suketoyo YAMANA, then the castellan of Izushi-jo Castle in Tajima Province.
When he was eight years old, the Yamana family was ruined by the invasion of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and his father became a ronin (masterless samurai).
When he was ten years old, Takuan became a priest at Shonen-ji Temple in Izushi and was granted Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist names) of Shuno.
When he was 14 years old, he joined Sukyo-ji Temple in Izushi and studied under Saido KISEN.
He changed his name to Shuki.
In 1591, when Saido KISEN passed away, Nagayasu MAENO, who had become the castellan of Izushi-jo Castle by then, invited Sochu TOHO, a disciple of Soen SHUNOKU, from Daitoku-ji Temple as the chief priest of Sukyo-ji Temple.
Takuan then studied under Sochu.
In 1594, Toho went up to Kyoto as he became the juji of Daitoku-ji Temple and Takuan followed him and joined Daitoku-ji Temple.
At Daitoku-ji Temple, he studied under Soen SHUNOKU of Sangenin Temple and changed his name to Soho.
After the demise of Toho, he moved to Sakai City in Izumi Province.
In Sakai, he studied under Shoteki ITTO of Yoshunin of Nanshu-ji Temple and was granted hogo (a Buddhist name) of Takuan in 1604.
In 1607, Takuan became shuso (the leader of monks practicing asceticism) of Daitoku-ji Temple and while residing at Tokuzen-ji Temple situated in Daitoku-ji Temple, he also became the chief priest of Nanshu-ji Temple.
In 1609, he was promoted to the 154th chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple at 37, but Takuan, who didn't seek fame and wealth, left Daitoku-ji Temple three days after his promotion and returned to Sakai.
In 1620, he returned to his birthplace Izushi and lived in a hermitage built at Sukyo-ji Temple, which had been revived by Yoshihide KOIDE, then the lord of a domain.
This hermitage was named Toenken.
After the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was established, its control of temples became tighter through the establishment of jiinhatto (laws for temples), and so on.
In particular, against the influential temples such as Daitoku-ji Temple, regulations aiming to weaken their ties with the Imperial Court, called Kinchu Narabini Kuge Shohatto (Laws for Aristocrats), were also imposed.
In these acts, it was stipulated that a priest who assumed the position of juji of Daitoku-ji temple was nominated by Edo bakufu, instead of the imperial decree issued by the Emperor, and only priests who obtained the approval of bakufu were allowed to wear sie (the purple Buddhist priest stole) granted by the Emperor.
In 1627, the bakufu annulled Emperor Gomizunoo's charter that allowed the wearing of sie by reason of violating the acts and ordered Kyoto Shoshidai (The Kyoto deputy) to confiscate the sie in question.
Takuan, who opposed bakufu's decision, went up to Kyoto in a hurry, organized monks of Daitoku-ji Temple in cooperation with Sohaku, a former chief priest, and launched a campaign against it together with Tanden and Togen of Myoshin-ji Temple.
In 1629, the bakufu exiled Takuan, Sohaku, Tanden and Togen to Kaminoyama City in Dewa Province, Tanakura in Mutsu Province, Yuri in Mutsu Province and Tsugaru, respectively.
In 1632, the Ordinance of Amnesty was issued when Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA passed away and those priests who had been involved in the Shie Incident were pardoned thanks to the efforts of Tenkai and Munenori YAGYU.
"Fudochi Shinmyo Roku" (The Miracle of Immovable Wisdom), which compiled letters which Takuan had sent to Munenori YAGYU, is well-known as the one preaching 'Kenzen ichimi' (The Sword and Zen are One).
Takuan then went to Edo and joined Kanda Kotoku-ji Temple.
Takuan, however, was not allowed to return immediately to Kyoto and in the winter of the same year, he moved to Naoyori HORI's second house located in Komagome and stayed there until the summer of 1634.
When Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA came up to Kyoto after Takuan had returned to Daitoku-ji Temple together with Sohaku, he had an audience with Iemitsu due to the exhortation of Munenori YAGYU and Naoyori HORI.
From that time, Iemitsu became a devout believer of Takuan.
In the same year, he returned to his birthplace Izushi but in the following year, he again went to Edo in response to an eager request made by Iemitsu.
Takuan did not want to stay in Edo but he could not return to his birthplace because of Iemitsu's strong request.
Iemitsu constructed Tokai-ji Temple on Mt. Bansho at Shinagawa and nominated Takuan as its juji.
Iemitsu often consulted with Takuan concerning political matters.
The above are believed to be conciliatory measures by Iemitsu.
Conversely, it shows the fact about how strong Takuan's influence was.
On January 27, 1646, Takuan passed away in Edo.
Although his graves exist at Sukyo-ji Temple and Tokai-ji Temple, Takuan used to say that he didn't need a grave.
Takuan's words and deeds in his later years could be interpreted as his apostasy or the fact that he was won over to Iemitsu's side.
Under such circumstance, historical assessment of Takuan is not yet determined.
It is generally believed that takuanzuke, pickled daikon, was invented by Takuan or was spread by Takuan in Edo while it had been popular only in the Kansai region.
According to the latter view, it is believed that when Takuan served takuwaezuke (literally, pickle to preserve) of daikon to Iemitsu taking the opportunity of his visit to Tokai-ji Temple, Iemitsu was satisfied with it and said 'It should be named Takuanzuke rather than takuwaezuke,' but this is no more than hearsay.
Takuan is often connected with Musashi in fiction.
In Miyamoto Musashi written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA, for example, he is depicted as a key person who bears the role of admonishing Musashi.
Shushin GIDO (February 8, 1325 - May 18, 1388) was a priest of the Rinzai sect who was active from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts to the Muromachi period.
Donin KUGE.
He was born in Takaoka of Tosa Province (Tsuno-cho, Takaoka-gun, Kochi Prefecture).
At Mt. Hiei, he became a disciple of Soseki MUSO who was closely acquainted with the Ashikaga Shogun family.
In 1359, he moved to Kamakura in response to the invitation of Motouji ASHIKAGA, then the Kamakura kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region), the position which bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) established for the purpose of governing the Kanto region, and taught the Zen sect to Motouji as well as the Uesugi clan of Kanto Kanrei (A shogunal deputy for the Kanto region).
In 1379, he went up to Kyoto and became something similar to a private tutor for the 3rd shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.
He exhorted the construction of Shokoku-ji Temple, served as the chief priest of Kennin-ji Temple, became the chief priest of Nanzen-ji Temple in 1386 and further served as the chief priest of Toji-ji Temple.
Along with Myoha SHUNOKU and Chushin ZEKKAI, he is well-known for his familiarity with Chinese culture and is considered as a representative Kyoto Gozan (Five Great zen Temples of Kyoto) academic priest.
Ryokei ONISHI (December 21, 1875 - February 15, 1983) was a Hosso Sect Buddhist monk who served as head priest of Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto and in his later years was also renowned for holding the record as the oldest person in Japan.
He passed away in 1983 aged 108 years.
He was born in Nara Prefecture and went under the pseudonym 'Muin.'
In 1889, he went to Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara where he entered the Buddhist priesthood under Teicho CHIHAYA.
In 1890, he studied the yuishiki (consciousness-only theory) under Join SAEKI of Horyu-ji Temple.
In 1899, he became the 231st head priest of Kofuku-ji Temple and was appointed chief abbot of the Hosso Sect in 1904.
In 1914, he was appointed head priest of Kiyomizu-dera Temple but retained his position as head priest of Kofuku-ji Temple.
In 1965, he established the Kita Hosso Sect headquartered at Kiyomizu-dera Temple and assumed the position of chief abbot.
He had a deep knowledge of Buddhist sects other than the Hosso Sect and successively held several important positions within the world of Buddhism.
His Buddhist sermons known as Ryokei no Sechi were highly popular.
He is also famous as the godparent of the first quintuplets in Japan, which were born in Kagoshima Prefecture in 1976.
Ryogen (912 - January 31, 985) was a priest of the Tendai Sect who was active in the Heian period.
His posthumous name was Jie Daishi.
He was commonly known as Gansan Daishi.
He was known as the person who rendered the most meritorious service for the restoration of Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei.
Although Ryogen was the 18th Tendai-zasu (the supreme position in the Tendai Sect) and a real-life person, he has been the target of folk belief since the medieval period and even in the 21st century, he is worshipped as 'Yakuyoke Daishi' (Calamity Dispelling Master).
In 912, Ryogen was born as a son of the Kozu clan, then the local Gozoku (local ruling family), in Torahime, Asai-gun, Omi Province (present-day, Torahime-cho, Higashi-Asai-gun, Shiga Prefecture).
He was called Kannonmaru (or Hiyoshimaru) in his childhood.
When he was 12 years old (or 15 years old), he went up to Mt. Hiei and became a Buddhist priest.
Although Ryogen was not a direct disciple of Saicho (Dengyo Daishi) and his rank was not high, he gradually distinguished himself as an able priest through refuting high priests of traditional Buddhist temples in Nanto (southern capital (Nara)) or praying safe delivery of a child for the Empress of Emperor Murakami, and finally he achieved Tendai-zasu, the supreme position in the Tendai Sect, in 966.
When Ryogen became Tendai-zasu, Enryaku-ji Temple was devastated as it had lost many doto (temple halls and towers) including Konpon-chudo Hall, due to the big fire that broke out in 935.
A fire broke out also in 966, the year when Ryogen became Tendai-zasu, but Ryogen reconstructed doto which was destroyed by fire, with the support of FUJIWARA no Morosuke, the maternal relative of Emperor Murakami (father of the Empress).
Further, he reconstructed Konpon-chudo Hall, which was a small hall when it was initially constructed by Saicho, as a magnificent hall and laid the foundations of Mt. Hiei's garan (ensemble of temple buildings).
In 970, he enacted 'Nijurokkajo Kisho' (26 Points sworn oath) which stipulated disciplinary regulations in the temple and strived to suppress armed priests' violence.
Ryogen is revered as the person who rendered the most meritorious service for the restoration of Enryaku-ji Temple thanks to his various achievements, including the reconstruction of Mt. Hiei's garan, the rise of Tendai Doctrinal Studies and the maintenance of discipline in the precinct.
He had many disciples and among them, Genshin (Eshin Sozu), the author of "Ojoyoshu" (The Essentials of Salvation), was famous in particular.
Although his Shigo (posthumous name) granted by the Imperial Court was Jie Daishi, he was commonly known as 'Gansan Daishi' since the anniversary of his death is January 3rd.
At the site of Ryogen's old residence, called Joshinbo, in Yokawa on Mt. Hiei, there is a Shiki Kodo (Four Seasons Lecture Hall) (it is so named because a lecture of Hoke-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra) was conducted at this hall once every four seasons) and it is called 'Gansandaishi-do' as Ryogen's image is enshrined in it.
Jie Daishi, Ryogen, has various other names such as 'Tsuno Daishi' (The Horned Master), 'Mame Daishi' (the Master of the Beans) and 'Yakuyoke Daishi' and these are worshipped by a wide range of people.
It is believed that Ryogen was the founder of 'omikuji' (sacred lots) which is now seen at many temples and shrines throughout the nation.
A lot of Ryogen's sculptures and paintings called 'The image of Jie Daishi,' especially those produced in the Kamakura period, exist in many halls and temples inside the precinct of Mt. Hiei as well as other temples belonging to the Tendai Sect.
These images have standardized appearances as the image for worshipping and their common characteristics are that they have slanted-eyed, severe facial expressions while holding juzu (beadroll), and tokkosho (a pestle with a single sharp blade at each end, found as an attribute of Buddhist guardian figures, and a symbolic item in Esoteric Buddhism) (a kind of Buddhist tool) in the hands.
Tsuno Daishi - It is a painting that depicts an ogre that has 2 horns and is so thin and is nothing but skin and bones.
According to legend, it is the image of Ryogen when he repelled a Yakubyo-gami (a deity of the transmission of epidemics) by transforming himself into an ogre.
Paintings of Tsuno Daishi were stuck on houses located in Sakamoto, at the foot of Mt. Hiei, and Kyoto as talismans for amulet.
Mame Daishi - It is a painting that depicts 33 bean-sized images of Jie Daishi on paper.
As Jie Daishi (Ryogen) is believed to be the incarnation of Kannon, this painting depicts 33 images of Jie Daishi based on the teaching of 'Hoke-kyo Sutra' that advocates that Kannon transforms itself into 33 figures in order to rescue Sattva.

Juzu (数珠) is a Buddhist ritual implement and a kind of ring composed of many beads which are linked by piercing a bundle of threads into a hole made on each bead.
As it means beads that are used when praying to Buddha, it is also called 'nenju' (praying beadroll).
In Sanskrit, it is called 'hasoma.'
While praying to Buddha, it is used for the purpose of rubbing, jingling and/or counting frequency of mantra and Buddhist invocation.
In sects that do not care about the frequency of Buddhist invocation, such as Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), it is used as a symbol of reverence to Buddha.
Generally, it is hung on hands that are put flat together on the occasions of Buddhist rites, Buddhist memorial services and/or praying to Buddha, Bodhisattva, memorial tablet of the deceased.
The way to hang on the hands is different from sect to sect.
Monks sometimes hang it on the neck instead of hands.
Concerning its origin, there are various views but it is generally believed that the tool used by Brahmanism in Ancient India is the origin.
The above tool was used by Sakyamuni and introduced into China later.
Thereafter, it was introduced into Japan in the Asuka period along with the introduction of Buddhism.
In the Kamakura period, when Jodo-kyo (pure land teachings) prevailed and Invocation of the Buddha's Name became popular, it spread widely among ordinary people.
At present, there are bracelet-type juzu, called udewa nenju (or wanju, bracelet nenju), which are miniaturized juzu that uses elastic as an inner string so that it can be hung on the arms.
However, udewa nenju is not suitable for use for the original purpose of juzu, due to its size.
It must be handled with care since it is a Buddhist ritual implement.
When carrying it, it must be put into an exclusive bag such as a juzu bag (nenju bag).
When placing it, it must be put on a bag, a nenju bag or a handkerchief and must not be directly put on tatami mats, and so on.
It is generally believed that juzu should be held by the left hand with a tassel hanging down or should be hung on the left wrist.
It is believed that the number of 108 represents the number of earthly desires, each bead of juzu represents 108 Buddha who preside over each earthly desire and juzu suffers all earthly desires of human beings.
Juzu that are called 'Honren' (main strand), 'Niren' (two strand) or 'Nirin' (two loops) are ones that are composed of 108 beads of 'Omodama' (main beads) (refer to the name of beads).
It is usually used by making it into double rings.
Juzu that are called 'one handed' or 'informal' are ones that are composed of a decreased number of Omodama instead of the original number of 108.
The number of Omodama varies widely from 54 beads which is half of 108, 36 beads which is one third of 108, 27 beads which is a quarter of 108 to 18 beads which is one sixth of 108.
In recent years, juzu that are composed of the proper number of beads suitable for the size of the ring (size of a hand), instead of sticking to a particular number like 22 beads or 25 beads, are produced.
There exist juzu that are composed of 1080 beads called Hyakumanben-nenju (literally, one hundred times of nenju).
As for a unit in counting the number of beads, '... ball' (玉, tama) or '... grain' (顆, ka) are also used other than '... bead' (珠, tama).
In this column, 'bead' (珠) is to be used consistently.
In the case of Honren-juzu, the biggest bead (one bead or 2 beads) is called 'Oyadama' (parent bead) or 'Moshu' (mother bead) and the 108 beads which mainly compose a ring are called 'Omodama.'
4 beads which are smaller than Omodama and lie between Omodama are called 'Shitendama.'
Other than the above, beads which are called 'Deshidama' (disciple bead), 'Kikotomo,' 'Jomyo' (pure bead), 'Tsuyu' (dewdrop beads) and 'Fukudama' (sub bead) respectively are attached to tassels.
〔Details to be mentioned later since different beads are used depending on religious Doctrines.〕
In the case of one hand juzu, the number of Oyadama is only 1 and a tube-like bead called 'bosa' (Bodhisattva) is inserted between Oyadama and tassel.
Many beads which mainly compose a ring are called Omodama, likewise in the case of Niju-juzu (double ring juzu).
2 beads which are smaller than Omodama are called 'Nitendama' (literally, beads of two celestial).
The Chinese character of '玉' (tama) is also used, other than '珠' (tama), for the name of beads.
珠' is to be used in this column consistently.
By and large, the shapes of juzu beads are categorized into the following three kinds.
Marudama (round-bead)
Mikandama (elliptic type) - It can be easily handled when counting the frequency of mantra and Buddhist invocation.
Juzu that is composed of Mikandama looks meaty and sublime.
Monks tend to prefer Mikandama because of ease of handling and fine appearance (though there is a difference depending on sects).
Hiradama (flat-bead) - It is sometimes used in the Tendai sect but not in the Nichiren sect.
Although cloisonne enamel was recommended in old documents, beads made from various materials, such as lime tree, are used today.
Prices of juzu widely vary depending on the bead materials.
Women prefer fine-colored juzu that are made from crystal or coral.
As materials for high grade juzu, crystal with gold line (rutile quartz), feicui (Burma feicui), ivory, lapis lazuli and Bo tree, and so on, are used.
For cheap juzu, glass beads and/or plastic beads which resemble stone beads or coral beads are used.
Attention should be paid to the fact that there could be different rules on materials, color and the shape of tassels depending on doctrines and/or sects.
Ptincipal Materials for Beads
Jewelry and precious stones - crystal and the like (crystal, amethyst, smoky quartz, and so on), agate (onyx), feicui (Burma feicui), green aventurine, coral and the like and tourmaline, and so on.
Wood - ebony, rosewood, Bombay black wood, Japanese box tree, White cedar and amber, and so on.
Nuts of trees - Bo tree, Rudraksha, hogan linden, ryugan linden and kogan linden, and so on.
Nuts of grass - seigetsu linden and renge linden, and so on.
Fragrant wood - sandal wood and dwarf Japanese yew, and so on.
Ivory
Glass
Celluloid
Pure silk and rayon (polyester) is used.
As for the shape of tassel, there are several basic patterns such as kashiratsuki tassel (literally, tassel with a head), kiri tassel (cutting tassel), yori tassel (getting together tassel), yotsumehimo tassel (four-eyed string tassel), kiku tassel (or Brahma tassel, chrysanthemum tassel) and Rikyu tassel (or temari ball tassel) but depending on craftsmen, these could be further broken down.
Beads which are vulnerable to harmful insects, such as those made from Bo tree, must be kept in a paulownia box or treated with insecticide.
Particular caution is required in handling fragile and/or soft beads such as those made from coral or pearl.
As the beads made from lapis lazuli, red coral, pearl or malachite are vulnerable to sweat, these must be kept in a paulownia box after wiping off sweat.
The following are general explanations concerning the forms of formal juzu for ordinary lay believers.
In selecting juzu, it is vital to confirm with a family temple or consult with a specialty store.
Juzu for the Tendai sect uses 108 beads of Omodama, a bead of Oyadama and 4 beads of Shitendama to compose a ring.
These beads are arranged in the following order; 1 bead of Oyadama=>7 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>66 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>7 beads of Omodama, and finally they are shaped as a ring.
1 small bead called 'Jomyo' is attached at the knot of a tassel made under Oyadama.
2 tassels are attached under Jomyo.
Various shapes are used for tassels (kiku tassel and Rikyu tassel (kemari tassel) are often used).
Deshidama is attached to each tassel.
Each Deshidama has its characteristics since Deshidama attached to one tassel is composed of 10 beads of Marudama and Deshidama attached to the other tassel is composed of 20 beads of Hiradama.
A tear-shaped bead called 'Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
The characteristics of the Tendai sect juzu is that flat beads called Hiradama (Sorobandama) are used for Omodama.
The way of holding (in case of Chuin school) - A prayer should hang Moshu on the middle finger of the right hand and hang odome (literally, lacing up the thong) on the forefinger of the left hand.
At that time, a prayer should twist nenju once so that its shape becomes the shape of an X.
When putting hands flat together in prayer, a prayer should put both tassels into the palms.
Then, a prayer should rub them 2 to 3 times slightly with the left hand up and the palm downward, while the right hand is down and its palm upward and should then stop rubbing by pulling the right hand towards himself/herself.
When holding juzu in Isso (a ring), it should be hung on the left wrist and in this case, it should be hung in a manner where Moshu is placed on the wrist of the left hand.
If and when a prayer holds juzu in Isso, he/she can make a sutra recitation while holding a sutra text in the right hand since the right hand is free.
There is no problem for lay believers (Buddhist supporters) to hold juzu according to Chuin school.
As for juzu for the Shingon sect, the number of Omodama and Shitendama used for a ring is the same as with juzu for the Tendai sect but the number of Oyadama is 2 beads.
These beads are arranged in the following order; 1 bead of Oyadama=>7 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>33 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Oyadama=>33 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>7 beads of Omodama, and they finally form the shape of a ring.
One bead of Jomyo is attached only to the knot of a tassel that is attached to Oyadama situated on the side of Shitendama.
2 tassels are attached to each of 2 Oyadama (4 tassels in total).
Various shapes are used for tassels (kiku tassel and Rikyu tassel (kemari tassel) are often used).
5 beads of Deshidama and 1 bead of 'Tsuyu' are attached to each tassel (Deshidama: 20 beads in total, Tsuyu: 4 beads in total).
Formal juzu of the Shingon sect for females, for which the length is approximately 24 cm, are called juzu for Hasshu sect (eight sects) and are on sale as one which is usable irrespective of sect.
An example in the design of juzu used by monks of the Shingon sect is the one which is composed of 108 beads, red kansen (string to connect beads) and white tassels.
As for the reason why kansen is colored red, there are many theses but no established thesis.
One thesis asserts that kansen represents a blood vessel and/or blood since a life (a soul) dwells in juzu.
In the Shingon sect, designs of juzu belong to the category of phenomenon (courtesy and/or manners of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism).
There is no problem for lay believers (Buddhist supporters) to use juzu for monks (108 beads, red kansen, white tassels).
Godairiki nenju - This is nenju which Nyojitsu HOTTORI, the president of the Daigosan Denpo Gakuin (Denpo (the teachings of Buddhism) Academy on Mt. Daigo), ordered to be produced when his hope was achieved through devotion to Buddhism.
Although it is nenju of the Shingon sect, which is composed of 108 beads, its characteristics are the use of beads made from two kinds of materials, as well as tassels composed of strings of five different colors.
It is on sale at Daigo-ji Temple as a prize for awarding.
Juzu for Jodo Sect and Ji Sect has a unique shape which looks like one that has mixed the two juzu.
There exist some differences, such as the number of Omodama, between juzu for males and for females.
Oyadama is attached to each of 2 rings but tassels are not directly attached to Oyadama.
A small bead called 'Fukudama' is attached to one of two rings alternately with Omodama.
A metal double-ring is attached to the ring to which Fukudama is attached and 2 tassels are attached to the ring.
As for the shape of tassels, kiku tassel and Rikyu tassel (temari ball tassel) are mainly used.
1 bead of Jomyo is attached to the knot of the tassel.
Deshidama is attached to tassels.
6 beads of Marudama are attached to the one tassel and 10 beads of Hiradama are attached to the other.
1 bead of 'Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
It is also called Nikka (daily) nenju.
In the Jodo Sect, it is believed to be desirable to use formal Nenju.
Other than the above, a portable juzu that is composed of 36 beads or dai (big)-nenju called Hyakumanben-nenju are also used.
Juzu for males is called Sanman jodo (literally, thirty thousands of pure land, or Sanman-guri (thirty thousands of telling)) of which one ring is composed of 27 beads of Omodama and the other is composed of 20 beads of Omodama and 21 beads of Fukudama which are allocated alternately.
It is used for telling the juzu while reciting Buddhist invocation, and it is possible to recite 32,400 times (27 times 20 times 6 times10 makes 32,400) by telling the juzu with all beads other than Fukudama.
The above is the origin of the name.
Juzu for females is called Hassun jodo (literally, 24 cm of pure land, or Rokuman-guri (sixty thousands of telling)) of which one ring is composed of 40 beads of Omodama and the other is composed of 27 beads of Omodama and 28 beads of Fukudama.
The number of Deshidama is the same as that of Sanman jodo.
Therefore, it is possible to recite 64,800 times (40 times 27 times 6 times 10 makes 64,800), twice the number for males, by telling the juzu with all beads other than Fukudama.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, there is no practice to telling the nenju while reciting Buddhist invocation and therefore, no rule exists concerning the number of beads.
No rule exists concerning the materials of beads either.
The form of the nenju does not matter, but it is highly esteemed as a ritual implement to be used while putting hands flat together in prayer.
In the case of male believers : It is believed to be desirable to use a himo (code) tassel of one-handed nenju.
As there is no rule on the number of Omodama, the number is decided depending on the size of beads, and the nenju that is composed of 18 to 27 beads are generally used.
Female believers of the Hongan-ji School of the Jodo Shinshu Sect (O-nishi (Nishi Hongan-ji Temple)): Female believers are often recommended not to use Honren Nenju.
Although a one-handed nenju for females is usually composed of 36 beads, there is no particular rule on the number of beads.
For one-hand nenju for females, kiri tassel, kashiranashi yori tassel (twisted tassel, or shinmatsu tassel (new pine tassel) and kashiratsuki yori tassel (twisted tassels with head) are mainly used.
Female believers of the Otani School of the Jodo Shinshu Sect (O-higashi (Higashi Hongan-ji Temple): Likewise the case of O-nishi, one-hand nenju can be used.
Kiri tassel and shinmatsu tassel are mainly used for tassels.
Notwithstanding the above, there is no problem for females to use Honren nenju which is generally called hassun monto (literally, 24 cm for followers).
In hassun monto, number of Omodama and Oyadama, allocation of Shitendama are the same as the juzu of Shingon Sect.
Tassels have a distinctive feature because they are knotted in a unique manner, called 'rennyo-musubi' devised by Rennyo Shonin, so that they cannot be used for counting.
One bead of Jomyo is attached to the tassel attached to Oyadama of the Shitendama side and 5 beads of Deshidama are attached to the tip of each tassel knotted at the position of the 5th bead from Oyadama.
One bead of 'Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
In other words, Deshidama is packed upwards in an X shape so that they are fixed.
A knot (rennyo-musubi) is made on the tassel attached to Oyadama on the opposite side.
The tassel is attached without attaching Deshidama and 'Tsuyu.'
As for the shape of tassels, kashiratsuki tassel is mainly used.
The Way of Holding Honren Nenju
In the case of the Otani School, it should be used in the form of a double ring with 2 beads of Oyadama fixed at a thumb and 4 tassels hung down on the left side.
It should be hung on a hand with Oyadama of the Deshidama side situated at the fingertip side and Oyadama of the rennyo-musubi side situated at the body side.
In the case of Hongan-ji School, it should be used in the form of a double ring and the tassels should be hung down.
Although large-sized Honren nenju for males, with a length of over 38 cm and which have a nagafusa (long tassel), are seen, it is basically shozoku nenju (nenju for costume) for monks.
As for juzu of the Rinzai Sect, the number and allocation of Omodama, Oyadama and Shitendama are the same as those of the Tendai Sect.
However, the shape of Omodama is marudama.
Bosa' (literally, Bosatsu (Bodhisattava)) is attached to Oyadama.
Jomyo and Deshidama are not attached.
While himo tassel is often used, kiri tassel is also used.
As for juzu of the Soto Sect, the number and allocation of Omodama, Oyadama and Shitendama are the same as those of the Shingon Sect.
A tassel is attached only to Oyadama on the Shitendama side.
The shape of the tassel is almost the same as that of the Rinzai Sect.
Oyadama to which a tassel is attached is slightly bigger than one to which a tassel is not attached.
Bosa' also is attached to Oyadama to which a tassel is attached.
Although it looks like juzu for Rinzai Sect, juzu for Soto Sect have a distinctive feature of using a metal ring called hyakuhachi-kankin (literally, one hundred and eight golden ring).
A silver ring is sometimes used for high-grade juzu.
Juzu for Nichiren Sect
As for juzu for the Nichiren Sect, the number and allocation of Omodama, Oyadama and Shitendama are the same as those of the Shingon Sect.
Tassels have a distinctive feature since tassels attached to Oyadama are not symmetrical.
2 tassels with a bead of Jomyo are attached to Oyadama (also called Jomyodama) situated on the Shitendama side (the side to be hung on the middle finger of the right hand) and knots are made on each tassel at the position of the 5th beads from Oyadama and 5 beads of Deshidama are attached on their tips.
Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
3 tassels are attached to Oyadama (also called odome) situated on the side where Shitendama doesn't exist (the side to be hung on the middle finger of the left hand) and a knot is situated under Oyadama.
Out of 3 tassels, 5 beads of Deshidama as well as 'Tsuyu' are attached to 2 tassels for each.
The remaining 1 tassel called "kazutori" (counting) is shorter than the other 2 tassels and 10 beads of Deshidama are attached to it.
Tsuyu' is not attached to "kazutori."
In the Nichiren Sect, even lay believers must use formal nenju (informal nenju is not be used).
- The above explanations are basically made regarding juzu for lay believers.
As for juzu for monks, the above may not be applicable since there are more detailed rules concerning costumes, and so on.
- There are subtle differences in the designs of juzu depending on sects/schools.
- In some regions, there are restrictions on the color of beads and/or tassels.
(For funeral, Omodama (white or transparent), tassels (white); for Buddhist memorial service, Omodama (colored ones), tassels (colored tassels), and so on.)
Custom-made juzu are available at some shops specialized in nenju.
Juzu of gradation, such as the ones made from crystal or amethyst, which is not available on the market, are also available.
Juzu should be repaired before the inner string is broken.
When tassels are damaged, they can be replaced under normal conditions.
By replacing the inner string, juzu, especially the expensive one or the one of a keepsake, can be used for a long time.
It is said that the color of juzu made from Bo tree or seigetsu linden (unbleached) will gradually change the color in amber over time and have depth to its color.
Repairs are undertaken by shops specializing in nenju or Buddhist altar stores which deal with the repair of juzu.
There exist some people who do not replace an inner string based on the thought that the cutting of string leads to the cutting of mishap.
For the same reason, it is believed that the natural cutting of string doesn't necessarily mean bad luck.
8 reidama (spirit beads) which appear in "Nanso Satomi hakken den" (The story of eight dog samurai and a princess of Satomi family in Nanso region) are 8 big beads that flown from crystal-made juzu that was possessed by Princess Fusehime and the remaining 100 small beads are connected and becomes juzu that Chudai hoshi possesses.
Similar things are used in other religions, such as Rosario in Christianity.
Sometimes juzu is written in Chinese characters as '珠数' instead of '数珠' by changing the order of each Chinese character.
According to the grammar of the Chinese language, which is the origin of a pair of these Chinese characters, a verb should be placed before a noun and this is the reason why 'juzu' is written as '数珠.'
In Chinese, 'to count the number of beads' is written as '数珠.'
Inso is a Buddhist and Hinduism term which refers to the gesture of the hands having a certain symbolic meaning.
It is a translation of a Sanskrit term mudraa, which originally means 'seal,' 'stamp,' and so forth.
In Japanese terms, it has the same meaning as the term ingei (印契) or its simplified form in (印), referring mainly to the symbolic gesture of a Buddhist statue.
There are several fixed patterns of inso in a Buddhist statue existing in a Buddhist temple or the like, which include the followings: one formed by hands clasped in the lap, like that of Kamakura Daibutsu (the Great Buddha of Kamakura); one formed by the right hand being raised and the left hand resting on the lap, like that of the huge image of Rushana Buddha of Todai-ji Temple.
Each form of inso has a doctrinal meaning that represents the details, nature and function of the spiritual awakening experienced by a Buddha; accordingly, ascertaining what form of inso is assumed by a Buddhist image allows, to some extent, the guessing of what Buddha is represented by the image.
Buddhas and Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) assuming various forms of inso are depicted in mandala (place of practicing Buddhism to attain spiritual enlightenment) of Esoteric Buddhism; however, this column briefly explains about several typical types of inso that are seen in Buddhist temples, and so on.
Major Types of Inso
Semui-in (mudra for bestowing fearlessness)
It is the inso formed by a hand raised with the palm facing outward.
As the meaning of the kanji, this is a sign indicating to a viewer that he or she 'does not need to fear' to encourage him or her.
It is assumed by Fukujoju Nyorai (Amoghasiddhi, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas).
Yogan-in (wish-granting mudra)
It is the inso formed by a hand pointing downward with the palm facing outward.
In the case of a seated statue, the palm may face upward; in this case, however, the finger side of the palm is tilted downward so that a viewer can see the palm.
This form imitates a gesture made when a person gives something to others and is assumed by Hosho Nyorai Hosho Nyorai (Ratnasambhava, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas), and so on.
Semui-Yogan-in
It is the inso formed by a combination of the right hand taking the form of Semui-in and the left hand taking the form of Yogan-in.
In the case of a seated statue, the palm of the left hand points upward while resting on the lap.
This is a sign indicating that believers' wishes will be granted.
Semui-Yogan-in is one of the typical forms of inso shown by an statue of nyorai (Tathagata), and many statues of Shakyamuni Nyorai show inso of this form.
An statue of nyorai with the palm of the left hand taking the form of Yogan-in and bearing a medicine pot is a statue of Yakushi Nyorai (the healing Buddha).
However, some of the statues of Yakushi Nyorai lack a medicine pot because of loss or originally there was no medicine pot.
In addition, some of the statues of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) represent Semui-Yogan-in; therefore, it is impossible in many cases to identify what Buddha is represented by this inso only.
Figure 1 shows Tian Tan Buddha assuming Semui-Yogan-in, which is located in Lantau Island, Hong Kong.
Tenborin-in (teaching mudra)
It is one of the forms of inso that may be assumed by Shakyamuni Nyorai, which is formed by both hands turned upward in front of the chest with the tips of the thumbs of both hands put together and the tips of the same fingers of both hands put together to form a circle.
This imitates a gesture made when a person explains something to another, and therefore is called Seppo-in (the term "seppo" means preaching).
The term 'tenborin' refers literally to spinning the dharma wheel and metaphorically to 'expounding the truth.'
Because of the existence of many patterns for which fingers and a thumb are put together, in what direction a palm is oriented (outward, inward, upward or otherwise), and so forth, there are many variations of this inso.
In the case of Shakyamuni Nyorai depicted in Shakyamuni-in (one of the 12 sections ("in" in Japanese) constituting Taizokai mandala) in Taizokai ((Womb Realm) mandala, for example, the right and left hands face outward and inward, respectively, with the finger tips of both hands pointing upward.
In this case, the right hand represents preaching to the audience while the left hand represents preaching to oneself.
Jo-in (samadhi mudra, gesture of meditation)
It is used with a seated statue formed by the palms of both hands facing upward and put on top of one another in front of the abdomen (in the lap).
This indicates that the Buddha is absorbed in contemplation (meditation).
It is assumed by Shakyamuni Nyorai or Dainichi Nyorai (the Great Sun Buddha) (in Taizokai) formed by the right hand put on top of the left hand with the tips of both thumbs put together and other fingers stretched.
This gesture is specifically called Hokkaijo-in, which is famous for being taken on the occasion of Zen meditation.
According to Esoteric Buddhism, Jo-in assumed by Amida Nyorai is supposed to be Hokkaijo-in; however, a variation formed by both hands placed together in the same manner and the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the middle or annular fingers) forming a circle may be assumed by Amida Nyorai of the Jodo Sect, and so on.
There are many variations of inso assumed by Amida Nyorai, which will be explained in full detail.
Sokuchi-in (Earth-Touching Mudra)
It is also referred to as Goma-in (literally, mudra of conquering the devil).
It is used with a seated statue and formed by a palm facing downward with finger tips touching the earth.
Shakyamuni is said, according to legend, to have sustained interference with his ascetic practices by a devil.
It is said that Shakyamuni touched the earth with finger tips at that time to cause a god of the earth to appear, thereby defeating the devil.
Therefore, Sokuchi-in symbolizes a strong mind pursuing the truth without being overcome by temptations or obstacles.
It is assumed by Ashuku Nyorai (Immovable Buddha) or Tenkuraion Nyorai (or Divyadundubhimeganirghosa, literally, Buddha of Thunderous Sound of the Heavenly Drum) besides Shakyamuni Nyorai.
Chiken-in (the knowledge-fist mudra)
It is formed by the left hand with the forefinger stretched and the thumb clenched by the middle, annular and little fingers.
And the right hand clenching the forefinger of the left hand with the tip of the thumb of the right hand and the tip of the forefinger of the left hand put together.
It is assumed by Dainichi Nyorai (in the diamond-world mandala), Ichiji Kinrin Buccho (the principal Buddha of the "Court of the Perfected") or Taho Nyorai (Prabhuta-ratnam in Sanskrit).
Kozanze-in (Mudra of Subjection)
It is formed by the little fingers firmly crossed in front of the chest.
Types of Inso Assumed by Amida Nyorai
There are several types of inso assumed by Amida Nyorai, any of which is formed in principle by the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the middle or annular fingers) forming a circle.
Jo-in
It is formed as mentioned above.
In the case of Amida Nyorai, there may be a statue assuming inso formed by both hands pointing upward in front of the chest with the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the second or third fingers) forming a circle.
Examples of statues assuming Jo-in existing in Japan include the principal statue in Hoo-do Hall (the Phoenix Pavilion) of Byodoin Temple in Uji City and the principal statue in Kotokuin Temple in Kamakura City (Kamakura Great Buddha) shown in Figure 2.
Seppo-in (the exposition of the Dharma mudra)
It refers to Tenborin-in.
It is formed by both hands pointing upward in front of the chest with the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the middle or annular fingers) forming a circle.
Examples of statues assuming Tenborin-in existing in Japan include the principal statue enshrined in the hall of Koryu-ji Temple in Kyoto; however, this inso is relatively rare.
The central Buddhist image in Taima mandala also assumes this inso.
Raigo-in (Reasoning Mudra)
Similar to Semui-Yogan-in, it is formed by the right hand turned upward and the left hand turned downward with both palms facing outward and the thumb and forefinger (or otherwise, the middle or annular finger) of each hand forming a circle.
This inso is assumed by Amida Nyorai coming to fetch a believer on his or her deathbed.
Examples of statues assuming Raigo-in existing in Japan include the central Buddhist statue among the statues of the three Amida divinities in Sanzenin Temple in Kyoto.
The principal statue enshrined in a temple of the Jodo sect or the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) assumes in principle this inso.
Figure 3 shows Ushiku Daibutsu (the Great Buddha of Ushiku) in Ibaraki Prefecture, which assumes Raigo-in.
In Joshin-ji Temple (commonly known as Kuhonbutsu) in Setagaya-ku Ward, Tokyo, nine statues of Amida Nyorai, which assume nine different types of inso respectively, are enshrined.
This is based on the idea of kubon-ojo (the nine classes of people reborn in the Land of Happiness according to the nine levels of religiousness), as preached in 'Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra' (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life, meaning Amida).
It is assumed that there are nine grades of gokuraku ojo (dying peacefully to be born in the Pure Land) from very religious people to accomplished villains as listed below: starting with 'jobon josho' (Upper grade: upper birth), 'jobon chusho' (Upper grade: middle birth), 'jobon gesho' (Upper grade: lower birth), 'chubon josho' (Middle grade: upper birth), 'chubon chusho' (Middle grade: middle birth), 'chubon gesho' (Middle grade: lower birth), 'gebon josho' (Lower grade: upper birth), 'gebon chusho' (Lower grade: middle birth) and 'gebon gesho' (Lower grade: lower birth).
In the case of the nine statues of Amida Nyorai enshrined in Joshin-ji Temple, the three types of inso assumed by Amida Nyorai, that is, Jo-in, Seppo-in and Raigo-in are assigned as 'Josho-in' (inso representing josho (upper birth)), 'Chusho-in' (inso representing chusho (middle birth)) and 'Gesho-in' (inso representing gesho (lower birth)), respectively, and combinations of the thumbs and the forefingers put together, those of the thumbs and the middle fingers put together and those of the thumbs and the annular fingers put together are assigned to 'jobon' (upper grade), 'chubon' (middle grade) and 'gebon' (lower grade), respectively.
It should be noted, however, that there are no explicit doctrinal grounds for the representation of kuhon ojo (nine grades of birth in the Pure Land) by nine types of inso and they seem to have been contrived in early-modern times in Japan.
Inso Referring to the Design of a Seal
The design of a seal imprint is called inso, and fortune may be told from such a design.
A symmetric arrangement of characters is assumed to be inauspicious; moreover, fortune is told from the appearance of the fracture of a seal arising from long-term use.
Zenjo ANO (1153 - August 8, 1203) was a priest from late Heian period to early Kamakura period and the seventh son of MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.
He was also known as Hokkyo (the third highest rank for Buddhist priests) Zenjo (or Zensei) ANO.
His mother was Tokiwa Gozen.
His childhood name was Imawakamaru.
Gien and MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune were his younger brothers by the same mother, and MINAMOTO no Yoritomo was his elder brother by a different mother.
His wife was Awa no Tsubone (Tokimasa HOJO's daughter).
His children included: Harimanokimi (the lord of Harima Province) Yorimasa, and Tokimoto ANO, a wife of FUJIWARA no Kimisuke (藤原公佐室).
Since Imawaka's father Yoshitomo was defeated and died in the Heiji War when he was at an early age of 7 in 1159, he was forced to enter the priesthood at Daigo-ji Temple and named himself Ryucho (隆超) (or Ryuki (隆起)), then Zenjo after a short while.
He was commonly known as Daigo Zenji (Master of Zen Buddhism), or Aku (evil) Zenji from his crudeness ("Heiji Monogatari" (The Tale of Heiji).
On September 15, 1180, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, his elder brother by a different mother, raised an army in Izu Province.
Upon knowing this fact, Zenjo slipped out of the temple and happened to meet Sadatsuna SASAKI and Sadatsuna's brothers shortly after Yoritomo was defeated in the Battle of Ishibashiyama on September 24, and was given refuge by them in Shibuya no sho Manor in Sagami Province.
On October 28, he managed to meet Yoritomo at a lodging in Saginuma, Shimousa Province.
This was the first reunion of members of the Minamoto clan.
Zenjo told Yoritomo that he had secretly slipped out of the temple in Kyoto upon knowing about ryoji (orders issued by princes, empresses, and so on) and then went down to the place having disguised himself as a trainee priest, and Yoritomo appreciated Zenjo's resolution by weeping with joy.
Winning Yoritomo's confidence, Zenjo was rewarded with Nagao-ji Temple in Musashi Province (the present Myoraku-ji Temple in Tama-ku Ward, Kawasaki City) and married Awa no Tsubone (a daughter of Tokimasa HOJO) who was a younger sister of Masako HOJO, Yoritomo's wife.
Awa no Tsubone became a wet nurse for the second son of Yoritomo, Senmanmaru (later MINAMOTO no Sanetomo), and thereafter established an unspectacular but solid position in the Yoritomo administration.
However, Yoritomo's death and the succession to the office of a shogun by MINAMOTO no Yoriie (Zenjo's nephew) in 1199 resulted in Zenjo being allied with Tokimasa HOJO (Zenjo's father-in-law) and Yoshitoki HOJO (Zenjo's brother-in-law) who supported MINAMOTO no Sanetomo and came to be opposed to Yoriie's followers.
Yoriie moved one step ahead of Zenjo and dispatched Nobumitsu TAKEDA around midnight on July 6, 1203, to have him arrest Zenjo as a rebel and shut Zenjo up in Kamakura Gosho (the residence of a shogun of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)).
Zenjo was exiled to Hitachi Province on July 12 and killed on August 8 by Tomoie HATTA under orders of Yoritomo.
He was fifty-one years old.
On August 31, Harimanokimi Yorimasa, Zenjo's son, was killed at Higashiyama Ennen-ji Temple in Kyoto by an immediate vassal of the shogun residing in Kyoto.
The tomb of Zenjo exists in Daisen-ji Temple in Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, adjoining the tomb of Tokimoto ANO, Zenjo's legitimate son, and is designated as a historic relic of the city.
The Ano clan as a samurai family was taken over by the lineage of Tokimoto.
According to records, the lineage surely existed until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, however, the lineage was much less influential, compared with the Ashikaga clan, a branch family of the Minamoto clan, which lineage was the same Kawachi-Genji (Minamoto clan) as that of the Ano clan.
This was considerably attributable to the fact that Zenjo and Tokimoto were killed as rebels, and another fact that the Hojo clan was extraordinarily wary of the Ano clan because the Ano clan was the lineage of MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo which was closer to MINAMOTO no Yoritomo than that of the Ashikaga clan, which branched from several generations before Yoshitomo.
On the other hand, Zenjo's daughter married FUJIWARA no Kimisuke, a lineage of FUJIWARA no Uona of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and her son Sanenao ANO founded the Ano family as a court noble from his maternal surname.
Renshi ANO (阿野廉子), who was in Emperor Godaigo's favor and gave birth to Emperor Gomurakami, was a descendant of the Ano clan.
Misao TAMAMATSU, who played an active role in the end of Edo period, was also a descendant of the Ano family.
Dakiniten (written as 荼枳尼天 or 荼吉尼天 in kanji characters) is a Buddhist goddess.
The term 'Dakini' is the transliteration of the Sanskrit term dākinī (spelled Dakini in English).
Dakiniten derives from a goddess from India.
Dakiniten was originally a goddess of farming, but later came to be assumed to govern sexual desire and later came to be assumed to be a female fierce god eating human flesh or live human hearts.
In Hinduism, this goddess is assumed to be a dependent of Kali (a Hindu goddess).
This goddess was introduced into Buddhism, and it was supposed that she had been exorcised by Daikokuten (the god of Wealth), that is, the incarnation of Dainichi Nyorai (Cosmic Buddha), and then permitted to eat human hearts, if dead.
She is said to have unrestricted supernatural powers, knows the death of a person six months ahead, and takes and eats the person's heart.
Belief in Dakiniten in Japan
In the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, Dakiniten is located in the southern part of Gekongoin (the most peripheral section of the Womb World) of the Womb World (one of the two worlds in Esoteric Buddhism, representing Dainichi Nyorai's spirit of salvation having every possibility of generation as a womb, where a fetus grows), and this goddess is depicted as a small tengu (mountain spirit (portrayed as winged and having a long nose)) sitting astride a white fox; therefore, she is also called Shinkoo Bosatsu (Fox King).
There exist records showing that prayers were offered for Dakiniten at an Esoteric Buddhism ceremony performed on the occasion of an emperor's enthronement.
In addition, several persons including TAIRA no Kiyomori and Emperor Godaigo were known to have performed a method of Dakiniten in esoteric Buddhism, however, "Genpei Seisuiki" (The Rise and Decline of the Minamoto and Taira clans) states that TAIRA no Kiyomori discontinued this method.
This goddess is extraordinarily difficult to enshrine because it is supposed that any person is required, once this goddess is enshrined, to keep believing therein in exchange for his or her life until his or her last moment and also that should such a duty be neglected (in other words, should incantation to worship the deity be discontinued), such a person would immediately become ruined or meet with disaster.
Thus, Dakiniten was considered to be a non-Buddhist religion and belief in it tabooed.
Dakini was originally supposed to sit astride a jackal in India but the fox was substituted for the jackal in introduction to China and Japan (because jackals were not present in those countries).
In other words, an image of Dakiniten riding a fox (which has not existed in India) has not been depicted in Taizo Mandala (Womb Realm Mandala) or the orthodox scriptures or ritual manuals of Esoteric Buddhism and was created in medieval Japan and the like.
It is supposed that the creation of the above image resulted in Dakiniten coming to be syncretized with a Shintoist god, Inari (the fox god) in Japan.
In Japan, Dakiniten is believed to be a goddess of good fortune.
Belief in Dakini in later India
In later Esoteric Buddhism after the introduction to Japan, a sexual image was added to Dakini, which resulted her to be depicted as a naked goddess having a skull.
Tachikawa School (Esoteric Buddhism)
Dakiniten later came to be deemed as a goddess governing sexual love, which resulted in Tachikawa School of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism being gradually founded from the Kamakura period until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts and flourished in Japan.
It is supposed to enshrine Dakiniten, set a skull as a principle image and attain Buddhahood while still in the flesh by sexual intercourse as a rite.
For this reason, Tachikawa School was said to be regarded as a heresy and was finally exterminated in the Edo period.
However, it is still controversial as to whether the doctrines and rites of Tachikawa School mentioned above were true or not because the above theories are all based on documents written by those who regarded Tachikawa School as a heresy and oppressed it, and most of the documents written by devotees of Tachikawa School, which are vital for verification of the genuineness of those theories, were subjected to book burning and Tachikawa School was treated as a heresy against the backdrop of its involvement in the political power struggle between the Southern and Northern Dynasties.
The term Sanmon refers to a gate located in front of a temple.
Sanmon is assumed to represent Sangedatsumon (Three Gates of Liberation), which consists of three gates symbolizing three mental states, that is, kumon (gate symbolizing emptiness), musomon (gate symbolizing formlessness) and muganmon (gate symbolizing desirelessness), to pass through before reaching the Buddhist paradise.
From the viewpoint of architectural history, it is said that a main gate facing the south and two auxiliary gates facing the east and west, respectively, as provided for temples in ancient times, were called Sanmon.
In more recent years, temples were provided with a large outer gate accompanied by side gates on the left and right sides, and later, temples came to have a large outer gate only; however, it is assumed that such a large outer gate remained to be called Sanmon.
There are several theories as to the derivation of the term Sanmon, including the following: that the term symbolizes the gates one has to pass through in order to be delivered from the three evil passions of avarice, anger and stupidity; or that the term symbolizes the gates to the three paths to Buddhahood of Shomon (learning), Engaku (self-attained enlightenment) and Bosatsu (bodhisattva).
In some cases, Sanmon do not have a door.
It is said that this represents Buddha's deep compassion which does not deny the entry of sentient beings into the Buddhist priesthood.
Some temples have gates that are referred to using the Japanese kanji "三門" (pronounced "sanmon", the literal meaning of this term is "three gates") in addition to gates that are referred to using the Japanese kanji "山門" (also pronounced "sanmon", the literal meaning of this term is "mountain gates").
