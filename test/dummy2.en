Summary
In 1862, by the petition of the lord of Utsunomiya Domain, Tadayuki TODA, Utsunomiya Domain was entrusted all the maintenance matters of the shoryo (tombs).
The chief retainer of Utsunomiya Domain Wasaburo MASE went to west for Shuryo (the restoration of the imperial tombs) in place of the lord.
The sanryo bugyo was stationed there to supervise the shuryo work.
On October 22, Wasaburo MASE was assigned to sanryo bugyo orally in the house of Dainagon (chief councilor of state) Toshikatsu BOJO.
In February 1863, Wasaburo MASE became Yamato no kami (the governor of Yamato Province) and on March 7, 1864, praising the completion of repair and maintenance of Mausoleum of Emperor Jinmu, he was assigned to Naganaga sanryo bugyo.
On February 21, 1868, it was renamed sanryo koho bugyo appointed by Yamato no kami, on July 28, an adjutant was placed in sanryo sokanhei and Hirofusa MADENOKOJI was assigned as superintendent general, Tadayuki TODA was assigned as adjutant and bugyo was abolished.
Shimozami was a subordinate of gate watcher serving at Mitsuke (area lying outside the gates of a castle) in Edo.
They distinguished passing processions which came to castle.
There was a rule that Gate watchers returned salute to passing processions depending on kakaku (family status) and positions.
To prepare for that, gate watchers had to identify the leader of processions quickly, therefore a specialist job, shimozami was created to distinguish processions.
Skilled Shimozami could identify whose processions they were instantly at a glance from a long distance.
In her own story included in Kasshiyawa written by Seizan MATSURA, she wrote that shimozami recognized the lord of Matsuura domain and responded appropriately though they just rode away in an urgent situation, unlike normal procession.
Yari-bugyo was a post in the Edo shogunate.
Three to five persons were appointed the post under the roju (member of shogun's council of elders).
The post took charge of administration of spears in the shogunate but was an easy job during times of peace.
The post supervised the Nagara spear fighters unit and the Hachioji Sennin Doshin.
Sakuji bugyo was a post held by hatamoto during the Edo Period.
The post was involved in hoi (traditional everyday clothes).
It was established in 1632.
The post covered administration of construction and maintenance under the bakufu government.
Specializing chiefly in woodworks, the sakuji bugyo administered carpenters and other craftsmen in the areas of detailed works, tatami mats and garden plants.
Starting in 1662, shumon aratame-yaku (officer in charge of persecuting Christians) began to take on this duty concurrently.
The post was abolished in 1792.
Along with fushin bugyo and kofushin bugyo, the three posts were known as shimosan bugyo (three commissioners, mainly in charge of repair and management).
The sakuji bugyo's salary was 2100-koku rice yield but was changed to 2000 ryo (gold pieces) in 1867.
There were two to three appointed to the post.
The office for the bugyo was located next to a metsuke (inspector of foot soldiers) office at the far end of a building between a storage room and a castle's middle gate.
Kyoto daikugashira, daikugashira (construction prefect), sakuji shita-bugyo, tatami bugyo (tatami magistrate), saikudokoro gashira (tooling office head), kanjoyaku todori (chief of accounts), sakujikata hikan (construction low-level bureaucrat), kawara bugyo (roof tile magistrate), ueki bugyo (garden magistrate) and sakujikata niwasaku were under the sakuji bugyo.
Jisha denso was a post placed in the Kuge (court nobles) Government in the medieval period and modern times.
It was denso who relayed petitions from specific temples and shrines to the retired Emperor or the Emperor.
The word 'denso' had been established after the late Heian period but the post was established during Emperor Gosaga's insei period (during the period of the government by the retired Emperor) in the Kamakura period.
Denso was appointed by In (the retired Emperor) or the Emperor and dealt with all petitions except ones managed by Kanto moshitsugi (court-appointed liaison with the bakufu [Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun]).
However, after Ex-emperor Gofushimi's era, when many temples and shrines were restored, the official duties of the denso were broken into smaller and denso who relayed between the retired Emperor or the Emperor and specific temples and shrines which occupied nationally important positions was established.
Jingutenso' (shrine messenger to the Emperor) of Ise Jingu Shrine, 'Kamo-denso' (Kamo shrine messenger to the Emperor) of Kamo-sha Shrine, 'Sanmon-denso' (Enryaku-ji Temple messenger tothe Emperor) of Enryaku-ji Temple, 'Nanto-denso' which controlled temples in Nara such as Kofuku-ji Temple, and others were established.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, as real power of the government affairs moved from the Imperial Court to bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the denso's duty changed to relaying petitions from temples and shrines to the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun during the Muromachi period) and Seitaishogun (commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians, great, unifying leader) although appointment and dismissal were still done by In and the Emperor.
As a result, jisha denso also had a function in the bakufu.
It was the same way that so denso which was in charge of civil administration shifted to the role of buke tenso established instead of Kanto moshitsugi.
However, after Onin war, the jisha denso became a messenger for In or the Emperor again since political power of the Muromachi bakufu weakened.
In the Edo period, they relayed petitions from temples and shrines through buke tenso to In or the Emperor and in some cases, to the Edo bakufu under the supervision of the buke denso.
Moreover, they started to receive petitions not only from specific important temples and shrines but also from small temples and shrines of each sect.
However, in sects (such as Hosso sect, Tendai sect, Shingon sect and so on) which monzeki (successor of a temple) was placed, petitioning the Emperor was performed through monzeki, and in small temples and shrines, it was done by the Yoshida family or the Shirakawa family.
In addition, jisha tenso held the post of buke denso concurrently in sects (Shingi Shingon sect Buzan-ha [ha means group], Rinzai sect Gozan-ha, Jodo sect, Jodo Shingon sect Hongan-ji Temple-ha and so on) which were protected carefully by the Edo bakufu.
Han-i was a doctor who served a feudal domain in the Edo period.
Although social status and job ranks varied by domains, there were doctors who served only the feudal lord and his family, and those who cared for others, as in the case of Edo shogunate having okui ishi (inner doctors for the Tokugawa family) and omote ishi (for others).
In many cases, doctors were separated into those holding hereditary positions in the samurai class and lower-ranking physicians who came from lower-ranking samurai or ordinary families.
Prior to taking over a family head position or during apprenticeship, hon-i was paid heyazumi-ryo and after completing apprenticeship or becoming the family head, his salary was paid in full.
In accordance to medical practices at that time, there were physicians in charge of 'hondo,' or internal medicine, and others called 'zakka' covering all other areas of medical care including surgery, ophthalmology, dentistry, acupuncture and moxibustion.
Although it was common that talented doctors in the samurai class were appointed the post of doctor for the lord, there were some rare cases of lower-ranking or folk doctors appointed to serve the feudal lord.
The latter was called the omemie-ishi (privileged doctor).
In addition, there was another practice which doctors worked in shifts at the castle when the doctor serving the lord was away.
Honjo bugyo was one of the positions of Edo bakufu.
It controlled Honjo (presently Honko in Sumida Ward) and Fukagawa (Koto Ward).
The fixed number of people was 2 consisting of one each from shoinban (the castle guards) and koshoban (page).
They managed civil administration, roads, bridges and waterways of Honjo and farmed out cleaning of water and sewerage, repair of water pipes and opening and closing of water pipe gate to citizens.
After the Great Fire of Meireki, Ryogoku-bashi Bridge was constructed across Sumida-gawa River and the construction of waterways for Kake-gawa River (in Tokyo) and Oyoko-gawa River was in progress and urban area was expanded to the west side of Sumida-gawa River where was not included in Edo before.
To respond to the situation, on May 4, 1660, Shigemasa TOKUYAMA and Shigemasa YAMAZAKI from shoinban (the castle guards) were assigned to 'bugyo of waterways for honjo residential land.'
This is considered as the beginning of honjo bugyo.
In 1685, it was abolished once, but on September 15 and 17 in 1693, it started again at the assignments of Yoshiaki TODO and Tsuneyuki TAGA.
After that, on June 3, 1713, residential area of honjo was transferred to machi bugyo and on May 21, 1719, buke (military authority) area was transferred to fushin bugyo (shogunate administrator of activities by a community, such as cleaning or fixing stone wall) and roads, bridges and waterways were transferred to kanjo bugyo and honjo bugyo was abolished.
General public administration and woks farmed out to citizens were managed by 'honjogata' (1 yoriki and 2 doshin) placed in machi bugyo.
