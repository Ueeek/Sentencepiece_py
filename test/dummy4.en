Known as Sesshu (1420 - 1506), he was an ink painter and Zen monk active in the Muromachi period in the latter half of the 15th century, and was called a master painter.
He revolutionized the Japanese ink painting.
He was given the posthumous name "Toyo" or "Sesshu (拙宗)."
Born in Bicchu Province, he moved to Suo Province after entering SShokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto.
Later he accompanied a mission to Ming Dynasty China and learned Chinese ink painting.
His works were many, including not only Chinese-style landscape paintings, but also portraits and pictures of flowers and birds.
His bold compositions and strong brush strokes constituted an extremely distinctive style.
6 of his extant works are designated national treasures. Indeed, he is considered to be extraordinary among Japanese painters.
For this reason, there are a great many artworks that are attributed to him, such as folding screens with pictures of flowers and that birds are painted on them.
There are many works that even experts cannot agree if they are really his work or not.
Representative works include: Long Landscape Scroll, Summer and Winter Landscape, View of Amanohashidate, Broken Ink Landscape, Portrait of Ekadanpi, Fall and Winter Landscape, and Folding Screen of Birds and Flowers of the 4 Seasons.
His disciples include Shugetsu, Soen, and Toshun.
He was born in Akahama, Bicchu Province (present-day Soja City, Okayama Prefecture), in 1420.
He was born to a Samurai family called ODA.
He entered nearby Hofuku-ji Temple (Soja City) while young.
He moved to Kyoto's Shokoku-ji Temple at the age of around 10, and while studying and having Zen training under Shuto SHUNRIN, learned painting from Shubun TENSHO.
In around 1454, he moved to Suo Province, and built his studio, Unkokuan (Yamaguchi City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), with the patronage of the feudal lord, Ouchi.
In around 1465, he acquired a calligraphy work by Bonki SOSEKI on which the characters of Sesshu were written, and requested Shinkei RYUKO to write a certificate about the origin of the name, Sesshu.
It is believed that after that, he came to be known as Sesshuu.
It is thought that until this time he was known as Touyou SESSHU, but there is not a firm source to indicate that SESSHU and Sesshu were the same person.
In 1468, he sailed to Ming Dynasty China with a mission.
He familiarized himself with authentic Chinese ink painting and studied it for about 2 years.
In the fall of 1481, he traveled to Mino Province.
There is no reliable record of the date of his death, but most put it at 1506.
Other records write that he died in 1502.
In addition to the date of his death, there are many other aspects of Sesshu's life that remain unknown.
There is an interesting episode about Sesshu.
A young Sesshu who entered Hofuku-ji Temple only liked pictures and did not want to read sutras; so the monks of the temple tied him to a pillar in the building enshrining a Buddhist statue.
However, when the monks saw that he drew a rat with his tears that fell on the floor by using his big toe, they were impressed so they allowed him to draw pictures.
This is thought to be the most well known story about Sesshu.
The story first appeared in "Honcho Gashi" compiled by Eino KANO (published in 1693, the Edo period).
Sesshu started to be deified in the Edo period.
It is thought to be because the Kano School that ruled painting circles at the time venerated him as a master, and feudal lords wanted to have Sesshu's artwork.
It is said that this is why the number of artworks attributed to Sesshu increased.
Reflecting Sesshu's popularity, a Japanese puppet drama/Kabuki work entitled "The Gion Religious Festival" was created.
The drama was first performed in January 1758.
The scene of Kinkaku-ji Temple, where Sesshu's granddaughter, Yukihime, takes an active role, is famous) and similar works were performed.
Today, Sesshu who gave birth to one of Japanese cultures is a leading historical figure of this country.

Soujun IKKYUU was a Zen monk in the Daitokuji branch of the Rinzai sect, during the Muromachi period.
He is known as a character in stories.
For IKKYUU's Witty Sayings refer to the section on "IKYUU's Sayings" (also some on this page); for the TV cartoon "Ikkyuu-san", refer to the section on "Ikyuu-san".
Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Gokomatsu.
In Kazunaga SUGAWARA's diary, "Higashiboujou Kazunaga Kyouki", he wrote on August 1st of 1494 that "it is said in secret that the monk IKKYUU is a prince, the illegitimate child of Gokomatsu.
Nobody in the world knows this."
According to later historical documents, his childhood name was Sengikumaru.
Called Shuuken for a long time, he also went by Kyouunshi, Katsuro, and Mukei.
Soujun was his Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name), also written as Soujun.
IKKYUU was his Dougou (monk's name).
(Refer to the section on "Kaimyo" for Kaimyo and Dougou.)
He took orders under Shuukan SHOUGE at Kyoto's Ankokuji at the age of 6, and was named Shuuken.
He quickly developed a talent for poetry; and his poems "Choumonshunsou", which he wrote at 13, and "Shunishukka", which he wrote at 15 years of age, were praised throughout Kyoto.
In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a student of Soui KENOU and changed his name to Soujun.
KENOU died in 1414.
Whether it was because of the death of his teacher is difficult to determine, but IKKYUU attempted suicide around that time.
In 1415 he became a student of high priest Soudon KASOU at Kyoto's Daitokuji.
He received the name IKKYUU from KASOU when he answered the Koan called Touzan's 3 Blows by saying "the treacherous path returns to the safe path; take a rest and let the rain fall, let the wind blow."
The "treacherous path" refers to the world of confusion (distracting thoughts), while the "safe path" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha).
One night in 1420 he heard the calling of a crow, and was immediately enlightened.
KASOU tried to give him a certificate of dharma transmission, but IKKYUU refused it.
It is said that KASOU laughed and called him a fool as he sent him away.
From then on he lived a crazy life of poetry, writing, and painting.
In 1428 Emperor Shoukou died without leaving behind a son; and Emperor Gohanazono from the Fushiminomiya family was enthroned.
It is said that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement was based on a recommendation from IKKYUU.
From "A chronological history of the Priest Ikkyuu of Toukai".
Actually, Yoshio IMAIZUMI says that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement had the support of the shogunate, and had nothing to do with IKKYUU's recommendation.
After the Onin War in 1474, at the order of Emperor Gotsuchimikado he was installed as chief priest (the 47th) of Daitokuji; and although he did not live in the temple, he put a lot of effort into its restoration.
The subsidiary temple Shinjuan was built with IKKYUU as its founder.
He was close to the emperor, and was also loved by the people.
He died at Shuuonan in 1481, at the age of 88.
It is reported that on his deathbed he said, "I don't want to die."
Shuuonan, commonly called "Ikkyuuji", is located in the Takigi area of Kyoutanabe City in Kyoto.
The ruined Myoushouji temple was restored by IKKYUU in 1456.
His grave is at Shuuonan and is called Jiyoutou, but is managed by the Imperial Household Agency as an imperial tomb, calling it the grave of prince Soujun, son of Emperor Gokomatsu, based on the stories about his lineage.
For that reason it is not open to the public.
Free and uninhibited, he was said to have many eccentricities.
The following anecdotes have been passed on.
He threw his certificate of dharma transmission and other valuable texts into a fire.
Besides homosexuality, he did things that are forbidden in Buddhism, such as drinking liquor, eating meat, and cavorting with women, had a mistress called Shinjisha, and one of his students was a son of his named Shoutei KIOU.
He walked about town in peculiar attire, such as with a wooden sword in a red lacquer sheath.
One day while Rennyo, the master of Honganji and also his friend, was out, he went into his room and took a nap on Rennyo's statue of the Amitabha.
Upon returning home to see this, Rennyo said, "what are you doing to my tools of trades?"
At the new year, he stuck a skull on top of a cane, and walked around yelling, "beware, beware."
This kind of action seems strange at first, but has something in common with such famous Tang dynasty Chinese Rinzai priests as Fuke, and as a teaching style is an expression of the eccentric spirit of Zen.
At the same time, it was also a way to criticize and satirize the decline Buddhism, and the growth of an authoritarian strain, and to raise an alarm at the wearing down and ossification of Buddhism.
This can also be understood from the sermon, "7 Buddhas Tsuukaige", which he wrote himself.
This kind of starkly human lifestyle, without concern for rules or formality, gained him sympathy from the masses, and in the Edo Period became the basis for collections of witty stories such as "Ikkyuu's Sayings".
IKKYUU was known as a skilled calligrapher.
It is said that IKKYUU was Jukou MURATA's teacher, and his writings were prized most highly among practitioners of the tea ceremony.
(Recent research has cast doubt upon the tales of IKKYUU being Jukou's teacher.)
His writings (poetry collections) include "Kyouunshuu", "Kyouunshuu Continued", "Jikaishuu", and "Skeleton".
He is representative of the Higashiyama culture.
He is known to have criticized the shogunate of Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA and his wife Tomiko HINO.

Woman is the storehouse of the dharma; she bears Buddha and Bodhidharma alike.
According to Antonio INOKI and others, the words attributed to IKKYUU that begin with "what will happen if I go down this path..." are not actually his words, but are actually from Tetsuo KIYOZAWA's poem "The Path"; although there is some confusion about the source.

Biography
Many stories recall that he was a quick-witted little monk in his childhood, and made a name for himself by doing difficult training in his youth.
This aspect is especially emphasized in the stories aimed at children.
Many of the stories feature him as a child getting one over on a priest or Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA with his witty remarks.
Such stories combine elements from "Ikkyuu's Sayings" with the real Soujun IKKYUU; and as far as his childhood goes, is far from historically accurate; it is probably done to get readers involved in the story, as it only gets into more difficult reading in the episodes from his youth onward.
Some accounts do not explicitly state the child IKKYUU's name or birth, or the names of temples.
"Ikkyuu's Sayings"
Known as "Ikkyuu-san's Witty Stories", these appeared in the Genroku Period (the first half year of the Edo era), over 200 years after IKKYUU's death.
The author is unknown.
Because "Ikkyuu's Sayings" includes, in addition to IKKYUU's deeds, many characters and folk stories in which IKKYUU has been substituted for other monks, it cannot be called historically accurate.
It is a book in which a historical figure has been imbued with the people's desires.
"Ikkyuu's Sayings" is beloved today as a children's book; and there has been a television cartoon adaptation, "Ikkyuu-san".
Through this story, many children have learned about Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, Rokuonji, and the Muromachi Period before ever going to history class.
Amida triad is one style to place a Buddhist image in Buddhism.
It is a triad style and consists of Amida-Nyorai, i.e., Amitabha Buddha at the center and two attendants, Kannon-Bosatsu, i.e., Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva on the left and Seishi-Bosatsu, i.e., Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva on the right.
(The "left"or "right" in this case is the direction seen from Amida-Nyorai.)
Kannon-Bosatsu is said to be the embodiment of the Amida's mercy and Seishi-Bosatsu is that of the Amida's wisdom.
The Kannon's crown displays kebustu, a small image of Amida, while the Seishi has suihei, a small water bottle, so you can tell one from the other with ease relatively.
In Japan, ancient examples are: The Amida triad made of bronze owned by the Tokyo National Museum, once dedicated to the Horyuji Temple as one of 48 Buddhist images (important cultural property), and the Amida triad also made of bronze enshrined in the Lady Tachibana's Shrine of Horyuji Temple (national treasure).
There are various forms of triads: Amida is seated in the center with statues on both sides standing (e.g. the triad in the Ninnaji Temple in Kyoto), all three statues are standing with Amida in the center (e.g. the triad in the Jodoji Temple in Hyogo), all three statues are seated with Amida in the center(e.g. the triad in the Seiryoji Temple in Kyoto), or Amida seated in the center and the other two statues are kneeling down (e.g. the triad in the Sanzenin Temple in Kyoto).
The triad with Amida seated at the center and the other two kneeling down on both sides is a form of Raigo, which means inviting the dead spirits to heaven. The left Bodhisattvas Kannon in this triad usually has a rendai, a lotus-flower-shaped pedestal to carry the dead.
There exists another formation made of 5 statues that includes Jizo-Bosatsu, i.e., Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, and Ryujyu-Bosatsu, i.e., Naagaarjuna Bodhisattva.

Shinran was a Japanese Buddhist monk in the early Kamakura period.
He is recognized as the founder of Jodo Shinshu, or Shin Buddhism.
On November 28th, 1876, Shinran was given the posthumous Buddhist name Kenshin Daishi by Emperor Meiji.
After Shinran met Honen (the founder of Jodo Shu) and became his disciple, he inherited 'the discipline of the true religion, Jodo Shu', making all efforts to enhance it.
He doesn't seem to have intended to establish his own sect.
He didn't possess his own temple, but constructed meeting places called Nenbutsu Dojo in various provinces to spread the teaching of Jodo Shinshu.
While Shinran's nenbutsu group was censured by the Buddhist establishment and the other sects of Jodo Shu, a distinctive character of his discipline became clear, so his followers established a new sect, Jodo Shinshu, after his death.
Jodo Shinshu is considered to have been founded in 1247, when Shinran finished writing "Kenjodo shinjitsu kyogyo shomonrui" (Kyogyo shinsho), but in reality it was after Shinran's death that Jodo Shinshu was officially recognized.
The Seven Patriarchs of Jodo Shinshu: Shinran selected the following 7 monks as the high priests who had taught and spread the doctrine of Shomyo Nenbutsu.

Japanese Buddhism
Genshin: "Ojoyoshu" (treatises on rebirth)"
Genku Sho'nin (Honen Sho'nin): "Senjaku Hongan Nenbutsu Shu" (treatises on the Great Vow)" (Singled-Out Collection)
Prince Shotoku: Shinran revered Prince Shotoku as "Wakoku-no-kyoshu" (the founder of Japanese Buddhism) and worshiped him as an incarnation of Kannon Bosatsu (Bodhisattva).
"Seventeen-article constitution"
Honen set the following three books as the canon, which were preached by Sakyamuni and generically called 'Three Pure Land Sutras': "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo", "Kammuryoju-kyo" and "Amida-kyo."
The book "Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo" was also called "Daimuryoju-kyo" (Daikyo), and considered the most significant sutra by Shinran.
In the teaching of Jodo Shinshu, those who awaken faith in the saving grace of Amida Nyorai and express deep feeling of gratitude by reciting his name "Namu Amida Butsu," are to be reborn in the Pure Land of Amida and become a Buddha.
Because long time ago Hozo bosatsu (Amida Butsu when he was still studying) invoked the forty-eight vows, and the main idea of the eighteenth vow (called the Great Vow) had been 'if any one is not saved in this world, I shall not attain Buddhahood', and then he became a Buddha with all his vows fulfilled.
It is the Great Vow of Amida Butsu that leads all the people (sentient beings) to the Pure Land, and the path to the Pure Land will open by the faith which is given by Amida Butsu (Easy Path).
This is called Shinji Shoin Shomyo Ho-on (meaning only the belief given by Amida Butsu leads you to the Pure Land, so you have to recite the name of Amida Butsu to express the feeling of gratitude).
As mentioned before, the faith in this context isn't the faith given by people's own efforts, but it is Amida Butsu who gives them the faith, and everything that happens in this world is due to the work of Amida Butsu.
This viewpoint is called "Tariki Hongan," which means salvation through the benevolence of Amida Butsu.
In the teaching of Jodo Shinshu, all people (sentient beings) are considered creatures who don't have wisdom like Buddha and have to live through the degenerate age of Mappo.
However, the teaching doesn't necessarily deny those who try to attain enlightenment by themselves (or those who try to choose the Difficult Path).
Shinran also wrote in his book "Shoshinge" that it is really difficult to keep holding your faith without any misunderstandings.
"Tariki" means the work or power of Amidabutsu.
Therefore the devoted followers of Jodo Shinshu choose not to use the word "tariki" in such contexts like 'you depend on the other people too much', or 'it is due to the work of sun, rain, wind, air or other nature', because the true meaning of "tariki" is not the influence of people or nature but Amidabutsu, though this misusage is pervasive now.
The idea called "Akunin Shoki" is also unique to Shinran.
This is something you can see in the thinking of Honen, who was Shinran's teacher, but it is also said that Shinran organized the idea as a doctrine.
In the book "Tannisho" is written that 'if even good people can be born in the Pure Land, how much more so the evil people', and this has also something to do with the concept of "Tariki Hongan," which was mentioned above. The meaning of this is that people (sentient beings) are too ignorant to do something good that leads to the Pure Land.
People (sentient beings) always do evil things, which never leads them to the Pure Land.
So, paradoxically, those who know they are evil are closer to the path to salvation by the Great Vow, rather than those who consider themselves good and still believe that they can do something good.
It could be said an extension of the idea of not-self, or Anatta in Mahayana Buddhism.
Shinran thought that we are all Gensho shojoju, which means we are saved by the Great Vow of Amida Butsu and already destined to go to the Pure Land, so he decided to live in this world illustrating how much his life is filled with joy and happiness derived from the life in the Pure Land.
This idea goes beyond that of Honen, and is one of the significant doctrinal differences between Jodo Shinshu and Jodo shu.
All the ages below are according to the East Asian age reckoning.
All the dates and years below are according to the Japanese lunar calendar, in order to show the accurate date and be able to identify the dates when the books are written.
On April 1st, 1173 (according to the solar calendar, May 21st), Shinran was born the first son of Arinori HINO, whose title was Daishin of the emperor's mother, near the present Hino Tanjo-in in the Hokai-ji Temple (Hino, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City).
His mother is recognized to be Kikko'nyo, granddaughter of Hachimantaro Yoshiie (=MINAMOTO no Yoshiie) of the Seiwa Genji clan.
His name as a child was Matsuwakamaro or Matsuwakamaru.
In 1181, when Shinran was 9, he was inducted into the Buddhist priesthood by Jien (who later became a chief abbot called Tendai Zasu) at a Buddhist monastery called Shoren-in, and given the Buddhist name Hannen.
After he entered the priesthood, he went to Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei and stayed at the training center called Jogyodo in the Shuryogon-in in Yokawa, where his master Jien served as Kengyo. He pursued his study and disciplined himself as a monk of the Tendai sect according to its religious practice of Fudan Nenbutsu.
He served for 20 years on Mt. Hiei, but he came to realize the limitations of Self-power.
Around the spring of 1201, when Shinran was 29, he left Mt. Hiei and for the purpose of praying for the coming generations he went to Choho-ji Temple (located in present Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto City), which was founded by Prince Shotoku, and secluded himself for 100 days there.
On the 95th day of his seclusion (April 5th of the same year), he had a dream in which Prince Shotoku (or Kannon Bosatsu's incarnation) appeared and said, "If you have sexual intercourse because of your previous karma, I will take your sin instead becoming the woman for you.
Serve the temple earnestly through your life, and I will lead you to the Pure Land at your death."
Shinran followed the prophetic dream, and as dawn broke he visited Honen, who had lived in Higashiyama Yoshimizu (present Maruyama-cho, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto City).
(Honen was 69 then.)
Shinran moved in a thatched hut in Okazaki (present Okazaki Higashitenno-cho, Sakyo-ku), and visited Honen for 100 days to listen to his teaching.
Shinran decided to become Honen's disciple when he learned Honen's teaching of "Exclusive Nenbutsu".
Then Shinran was given a new Buddhist name, "Shakku", by Honen.
Shinran studied hard, and gradually earned the respect of his master Honen.
On April 14th, 1205, (5 years later of Shinran's becoming Honen's disciple), Honen permitted Shinran to make a copy of his work, "Senjaku Hongan Nenbutsushu" (Singled-out Collection) and draw a portrait of Him.
This was a privilege reserved for only a select few disciples.
At about this time, Shinran asked Honen to change his name, and was given the name "Zenshin".
It is said that during his study under Honen, Shinran got married with either Tamahi, daughter of Kanezane KUJO, or Eshinni, daughter of the Miyoshi clan.
At that time, it was common to allow exiled criminals to marry, and this interpretation is supported even today.
There are many stories about Shinran's marriage, such as the idea that Tamahi and Eshinni were the same person.
In the illustrated biography of Shinran called Hongan-ji Sho'nin Denne, the painting of 'Entering Yoshimizu Temple' is followed by that of 'The Oracle at Rokkakudo', but the book of "Eshinni shosoku" says, 'Shinran made ceaseless visits to the master Honen for 100 days, and it was just like his seclusion at the Rokkakudo, which lasted for 100 days,....'
Generally speaking, the descriptions about these events in the book of "Godensho" are considered Kaku'nyo's miswriting.
Besides that, some handwritten copies of the book say "The Oracle at Rokkakudo" and "Entering Yoshimizu Temple" were events that happened in 1626, but they are also considered errors in writing.
(The West Hongan-ji Temple version of the book says only "The Oracle at Rokkakudo" took place in 1626.)
In February, 1207, at the protest of Kofuku-ji Temple, Honen's "Exclusive Nenbutsu" was suppressed, and 4 people including Junsai were executed, and 8 people including Honen and Shinran were to be banished (this incident is called Jogen no Honan).
Honen and Shinran were deprived of their Buddhist names then.
Honen was given the nonclerical name "Motohiko FUJII", and Shinran "Yoshizane FUJII".
Honen was banished to Tosa Province (present Kochi Prefecture), and Shinran to Echigo Kokufu (present Niigata Prefecture).
Partly because the letters of his Buddhist name Zenshin were used in the secular name Yoshizane, he called himself "Gutokusha Shinran" (Gutokusha means a foolish bald man), borrowing the Shin from India's Tenshin Bosatsu and the Ran from Unran Daishi, and began to lead a life of "Hiso Hizoku" (neither monk nor layman).
Some accounts have it that at about this time Shinran got married to Eshinni, daughter of the strong warrior Tamenori MIYOHI.
Also, he is said to have had a baby in exile.
In November, 1211 (5 years after his exile), the court issued an order to pardon Shinran and Honen.
On January 25th, 1212, Honen died in Kyoto at the age of 80.
So Shinran never met his master again.
Partly because of this, Shinran didn't return to Kyoto and remained in Echigo.
In 1214 (three years after the pardon), Shinran left Echigo with his family and some disciples such as Shoshin to preach his teachings to the people in the Kanto region, and they made their way from the Zenko-ji Temple in Shinano Province, through Sanuki no sho in Kozuke Province to Hitachi (present northeast area of Ibaraki Prefecture).
In 1216, Shinran began to build thatched huts such as "Oyama no soan" (located in present Shirosatomachi, Ibaraki Prefecture), "Kojima no soan" (located in present Ojima, Shimotsuma-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture) and "Inada no soan" in Inada no go (present Inada, Kasama-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture).
He settled at Hitachi Province and spread his teachings vigorously to the people there.
His missionary work in the Kanto region lasted about 20 years.
It is also said that Shinran spent 4 years on writing a rough draft of his main work "Kenjodo shinjitsu kyogyo shomonrui" (Kyogyo shinsho) at his thatched hut in Inada.
According to the Sainen-ji Temple's story, Shinran's wife Eshinni didn't accompany him to Kyoto and remained in "Inada no soan" until her death.
Shinran's 24 leading disciples in the Kanto region came to be called "Kanto twenty-four followers of Shinran" in later days.
These disciples founded temples in the area of Hitachi, Shimotsuke and so on.
The number of the temples founded by the Kanto followers are now 43, and they survive to this day being called "Temples founded by twenty-four followers of Shinran".
In 1234, the Kamakura shogunate declared a ban on Nenbutsu practitioners.
That is why Shinran made his way to Kyoto at the age of 62 or 63.
After his return to Kyoto, he began to devote himself to writing books.
After Shinran left Hitachi Province, various heresies and misinterpretations of his teachings to arose.
Around 1247, when Shinran was about 75, he completed his work "Kyogyo shinsho", which Shinran had been revising and supplementing for a long time, and he allowed his disciple Sonren to copy his book.
In 1248, he completed these two books of "Jodo wasan" and "Koso wasan".
In 1250, he completed "Yuishinsho mon'i" (preserved in the Morioka Honsei-ji Temple).
In 1251, Shinran sent a letter to pacify a dispute called "Unen-munen no jo," which happened in Hitachi Province.
In 1252, he completed "Jodo monruijusho".
Around 1253, Shinran sent his son Zenran and his grandson Nyoshin to the Kanto region in order to spread an authentic doctrine to people.
However, Zenran devoted himself to the wrong doctrine called "Senju kenzen", and he preached the heresy even to the people who had understood Shinran's teachings properly, causing a turmoil.
Nyoshin kept preaching Shinran's teachings to the people at Oami, Mutsu Province, and gained a large number of disciples called "Oami monto".
In 1254, it is said that Eshinni asked her youngest daughter Kakushinni to take care of Shinran, and she left for her hometown Echigo.
The reason she returned home was to take care of her relatives and the lands of the Miyoshi family to which she was born.
In 1255, he completed "Songo shinzo meimon" (an abstract/ preserved in the Houn-ji Temple in Fukui Prefecture), "Jodo sangyo ojo monrui" (an abstract/ Kencho version), "Gutokusho" (2 vols.) and "Kotaishi Shotoku hosan" (75 poems).
In 1256, he completed "Nyushutsu nimonge" (hymns on the two gates, entrance and exit) (preserved in the Houn-ji Temple in Fukui Prefecture).
Shinran declared that he would disown his son Zenran in his letter dated May 29th of that year, because Zenran preached heresy to the people in the Kanto region.
It is thought that the visit to the Kanto followers mentioned in the second chapter of the "Tannisho" took place around this time.
In 1256, Shinran completed "Nyorai nishu ekomon" (Osoeko Gensoeko monrui).
In 1257, he completed "Ichinen tanen mon'i (means notes on one-thought and many-thoughts)" and "Dainihonkoku zokusan'o shotoku taishi hosan", and made a copy of "Jodo sangyo ojomonrui" (longer version/Kogen version).
In 1258, he completed "Songo shinzo meimon" (longer version) and "Shozomatsu wasan".
The three books "Jodo wasan", "Koso wasan" and "Shozomatsu wasan" as a set are called 'Sanjo wasan'.
The letters written by Shinran around this time were later compiled into the books of "Mattosho" (compiled by Jukaku) and "Shinran Sho'nin goshosokushu" (compiled by Zensho).
On January 16th, 1263, he died at the age of 90 (according to the East Asian age reckoning, and 89 in a regular way of counting) in "Zenpo-in" at Oshikoji Minami and Madenokoji Higashi (his younger brother Jin'u served as a chief monk there).
There are various explanations as to the place of his death, "Zenpo-in (Zenpo-bo) at Oshikoji Minami/Madenokoji Higashi."
The Hongan-ji sect said that "Zenpo-bo" was at the west side of Madenokoji, and restored Zenpo-in (present-day Hongan-ji Sect Kadonobo Annex).
The Otani Sect supposed the location of "Zenpo-in" to be at the ruins of Hosen-ji Temple, built in a place that had come to be called "Shinrangahara" (present-day Kyoto Municipal Kyoto Oike Middle School - Toraishi-cho), and erected a stone monument with the words "The Place Where Kenshin Daishi Passed On."
(Some also say that he passed on at Koen-ji Temple (Kyoto City Shimogyo Ward) and his body was moved to Zenpo-in for some reason.)
At his death, Shinran's younger brother Jin'u and his youngest daughter Kakushinni, among others, were with him.
His ashes were interred at "Otani", north of Toribeno.
Since his exile, he had stuck to his own status which was neither a monk nor a layman.
The ritual called "Ho-onko" for expressing the feeling of gratitude to Shinran takes place on the date of his death annually.
According to the book of "Godensho" written by the 3rd caretaker of Hongan-ji Temple Kakunyo, 'his cremation was held at Ennin-ji Temple, south of Toribeno.'
The Hongan-ji sect says that he was cremated around the south side of Mt. Toribe (present-day Otani Honbyo/Nishi Otani Ondabisho).
The Otani sect says that he was cremated at Enni-ji Temple (Imakumano, Kyoto City Higashi Ward).
(Present-day Enni-ji Temple was restored by the 21st chief priest of Higashi Hongan-ji, Kosho OTANI.)
Some belongings left by Shinran and a part of his skull were carried to the Kanto region by disciples such as Zensho, and placed into the "Inada no soan" in which Shinran lived while preaching in the Kanto region.
A statue of Shinran at
In 1272 (10 years after Shinran's death), with the help of Shinran's followers, Kakushinni moved the tomb of Shinran at "Otani" to the north of Yoshimizu (near the present Sotai-in (Chion-in Tacchu)) and constructed a hall called "Otani byodo."
(In 1295, Shinran's image was enshrined in the hall, which came to be called "Otani eido".)
(In 1312, he posted the name "Senju-ji," but the people of Enryaku-ji Temple opposed it and the name was taken down.)
Hongan-ji Temple survived until 1465 (the time of the 8th caretaker, Rennyo), when it was destroyed by the congregation from the Saito area of Enryaku-ji Temple (the incident is called Kansho no Honan).

Jodo Shu is one of the denominations of Buddhism in Japan, which was founded by Honen Shonin and the teaching and practice of which is Jodo Kyo Senju-nenbutsu (Exclusive Nenbutsu).
Honzon (main image) is Amida Nyorai (Funagokoryumida).
Honen swore to be a monk, following the will of his father, URUMA no Tokikuni.
He was sent to his uncle's temple, Bodai-ji, before he went to Mt. Hiei, the center of Buddhist study.
He studied hard under Kangaku Shonin there.
But after four years, his teacher monk Kangaku Shonin said to Seishimaru 'I have nothing to teach you any more. How about going to study at Mt. Hiei?', so he went to Mt. Hiei in 1145, when he was only 13 years old.
After that he learned Buddhism under Genko Shonin at Eizan Komponchudo.
After Seishimaru had learned everything Genko Shonin could have taught, he started to study under Koen Ajari.
Seishimaru was ordained officially by Koen in 1147, when he was 15.
In 1150 (18 years old), Seishimaru moved to Bessho of Seiryu-ji Temple (in Sakamoto, Otsu city), was taught by Jigenbo Eiku Shonin, named Honen-bo Genku (used one Kanji character each from Genko and Eiko).
In 1175, when he was 43, Honen realized the truth of Senju-nenbutsu by Kanmuryojukyosho (Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra), written by Zendo Daishi, so he left Mt. Hiei for Higashiyama Yoshimizu and began to spread the teaching of the nenbutsu.
It is said that this is the beginning of Jodo Shu.
The words of Kangyosho, which made Honen found Jodo Shu are:
The way of Ojo (birth in the Pure Land) is to continue to recite the name of Mida (Amida) intently whenever and wherever, regardless of length of time.
That is because it leads to the true wish of Mida.
Recite the name of Mida intently.
Whenever and wherever, it doesn't matter how long you recite.
Continue to recite the name of Mida and it is the true way for Ojo.
That is because it leads to the true wish of Mida.
"Namu Amida Butsu" means to believe in Amida Butsu.
It is said the nenbustu of Jodo Shu began with the selection of these words, Mida Butsu.
"Senchaku Hongan nenbutsu Shu" (Passages on the Selection of the nenbutsu in the Original Vow) is the main sacred book, which is a compilation of dogma.
When Honen founded Jodo Shu, he was criticized by old temples such as Tendai denomination and Kofuku-ji temple of Nara, and exiled to Sanuki province (Jogen persecution), but he propagated Jodo Shu there as well.
After that he was pardoned but forbidden to enter Kyoto, so he continued to propagation based at Katsuo-ji Temple in Settsu Province.
Honen was allowed to come back to Kyoto in 1211(Kenreki 1), but passed away at the age of 80 next year.
History
After Honen passed away, Shinku, an elder disciple, succeeded the Jodo Shu denomination, but there were subtle differences in the interpretation of the dogma of Honen between disciples such as Shoku, Bencho, Kosai, Chosai, Ryukan and Shinran.
In 1227, Senju-nenbutsu was forbidden again, and Jodo Shu was damaged heavily and moved toward separation (Karoku persecution).
The reason for this persecution was that nenbutsu priests were suspected of robbery when the treasure of Hossho-ji Temple was stolen.
In addition, monks of Enryaku-ji Temple attacked nenbutsu priests, "Senchaku Hongan nenbutsu Shu (Passages on the Selection of the nenbutsu in the Original Vow)" was banned, and Honen's mausoleum at Higashiyama Otani (Kyoto) was destroyed.
At this time Kosai was exiled to Iki Province and Ryukan to Mutsu Province as well.
Honen's body was accepted by Raigo Enku of Uzumasa Koryu-ji Temple and cremated at Ao'no in Nishiyama.
After that, Jodo shiryu (four sects of Jodo Shu) were founded.
That is the four sects that were the mainstream of Jodo Shu after Shinku's death, Seizan-gi of Shoku, Chinzei-gi of Bencho who was patronized by the Kusano clan in Kyushu, Chorakuji-gi of Ryukan who spread Tanen-gi in Eastern area after exile there, Kuhonji-gi of Chosei who taught Shogyohongan-gi against Shoku in Kyoto.
These four sects do not include Shinran's sect, one of the strongest sects at that time, which became independent as Jodo Shinshu after he died. Other independent sects were founded left and right by other priests such as Tanku of Nison-in Temple in Saga (Kyoto), Genchi who revived Chion-in Temple and Kosei who introduced Ichinen-gi.
But only Seizan-gi and Chinzei-gi remained through the Middle ages, other than Jodo Shinshu, and they were called Seizan School and Chinzei School.
On the other hand, the Kamakura Shogunate oppressed Jodo Shu to stop nenbutsu in Kamakura, but Seizan-ha was welcomed by Hojo clan later and built a base in Bengayatasu of Kamakura.
Moreover, Ryochu, who was a disciple of Bencho, founder of Chinzei-ha, had established his influence in Kanto area based on Goshin-ji Temple (present Komyo-ji Temple in Kamakura city).
Gokuraku-ji Temple in Kamakura (Kamakura city) was said to have been a Jodo Shu Temple before becoming a Shingon-risshu temple, and Kotoku-in (Kamakura Daibutsu) is a representative Jodo Shu temple in Kamakura (it is said that it was in the Edo period that it officially became a Jodo Shu Temple, there are various opinions about the early period.
But Jodo Shu fell into an era of separation; Nishiyama-ha separated to Nishitani-ryu, Fukakusa-ryu, Higashiyama-ryu and Saga-ryu after Shoku died, and Chinzei-ha separated into Shirohata-ha, Nagoe-ha, Fujita-ha, Ichijo-ha, Kobata-ha and Sanjo-ha after Yoshitada died.
From the Nanbokucho period to the Muromachi period Shokan and Ryoei of Fujita-ha and Shogei and Shoso of Shirohata-ha appeared within Chinzei-ha and founded new sects, overcoming Seizan-ha and other sects of Chinzei-ha.
Especially, Seido insisted on the rule of Goju-soden (Fivefold Transmission) because Jodo Shu has a succession of dogma and genealogy, and tried to integrate various sects by organization of genealogy and dogma.
Shoso built Zojo-ji Temple and his disciple, Gutei, built Daiju-ji Temple at the request of Chikatada MATSUDAIRA.
Chion-in, which was revived by Shirohata-ha after the Onin War, was admitted as the head temple of Jodo Shu by Emperor Ogimachi in 1575 and given authority to grant or deny vestments to Jodo Shu monks in Japan ('Kiharinji').
In addition, after the foundation of the Edo Shogunate by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, who was a descendant of Chikatada MATSUDAIRA, Jodo Shu was protected heavily.
Sonsho in Chion-in and Son'o in Zojo-ji Temple were especially respected by Ieyasu.
In 1615 Jodoshu hatto was established as one of the rules of Jiin shohatto, in which Chion-in was recognized as the head temple, and Zojo-ji Temple was given the name of Daihonzan and Sorokusho (a government office of religion) was founded there although it had a lower position than Chion-in.
At this time the Edo government established Jodo Seizan-ha hatto for Seizan-ha independently.
By these rules Jodo Shu was protected by Tokugawa Shogunate, in other words, Shogunate and domain system.
After the chaos of Haibutsu kishaku, Tetsujo UGAI and Gyokai FUKUDA tackled modernization of Jodo Shu. Integration of Chinzei-ha by the Shirohata-ha that unified Nagoshi-ha and others led to the prototype of present Jodo Shu.
After World War, Kurodani Jodoshu, based in Konkaikonmyo-ji Temple, and Honpa Jodoshu (Jodoshu Honpa), based in Chion-in, became independent, but in 1961, when a memorial ceremony for the 750th anniversary of Honen's death was held, Jodoshu Honpa returned and Kurodani Jodoshu also returned 16 years later.
The representative director of Jodo Shu as a present religious corporation is called 'Shumu Socho' and responsible director is called 'Naikyoku'.
On the other hand, Seizan-ha has been separated into Seizan Jodoshu, Seizan Zenrinji-ha and Seizan Fukakusa-ha.
Jodoshu Shasei-ha, which was separated in the reform movement in Edo period, also has remained.

The Shingon sect is a Buddhist sect of Japan that was founded by Kukai (Kobo Daishi) in the early ninth century.
It is also called the Shingon Darani sect, Mandala sect or Himitsu sect.
It is based on Mikkyo, or esoteric Buddhism, which Kukai learned from Eka (Keika), at Shoryu-ji Temple (Qinglongsi Temple) in Choan, (Changan) (Xian City) during the Tang dynasty.
Meanwhile, the Tendai sect in Japan, which was founded by Saicho at about the same time, learned the Hoke-kyo Sutra, Mikkyo, commandment and Zen simultaneously.
In his works 'Himitsu Mandala Jujushinron' and 'Hizohoyaku,' Kukai expressed appreciation for another Buddhist sect, Dharma, which was at that time established to some extent, and built that thinking into a rating system of 1 to 10 by placing the Shingon sect above the Dharma.
Finally, he preached that Mikkyo (Shingon Mikkyo) was superior to esoteric Buddhism and that the thinking and sutras of esoteric Buddhism were included to Shingon Mikkyo.
While Tendai Mikkyo is called 'Daimitsu,' Shingon Mikkyo is called 'Tomitsu.'
Mikkyo, of the Shingon sect, was called 'Tomitsu' because it was centered on the To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple).
The founding of the sect
Kukai founded Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple in 816 as a dojo for Zen training, and established a sect having the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple (To-ji Temple), which was given by the Imperial Court in 823, as a fundamental dojo of the Shingon sect.
Before Kukai fell into deep meditation, he asked his disciples to take charge of the temples in which he had worked as a chief priest.
To-ji Temple was put in charge by Jitsue, Kongobu-ji Temple by Shinzen, Jingo-ji Temple by Shinzei, Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) by Eun, Ninna-ji Temple was founded by Kanpyo Hoo (an abdicated emperor who had joined a Buddhist order); (寛平法皇) (Emperor Uda) by Shobo, Enjo-ji Temple by Yakushin and so on.
These temples were permitted to be state-sanctioned schools of monks (Nenbundosha) (年分度者), and therefore tended to be independent.
Kangen became Toji-Choja (the chief abbot of To-ji Temple) and at the same time Kongobu-ji Temple's head priest, and established the Honmatsu system in which To-ji Temple was the head temple and Kongobu-ji Temple was the sub-temple.
Toji-Choja came to control the Shingon sect.
After a defeat in the conflict of Honmatsu, Kongobu-ji Temple was damaged in a fire due to lightning and lost its halls.
Koyasan fell into decline and abandonment due to the tyranny of provincial officers and other reasons.
This situation continued until the mid-Heian period, but Koyasan began to make a recovery after FUJIWARA no Michinaga climbed it (making a pilgrimage to a shrine on the mountain), and he was later followed by the Imperial Family, the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), and court nobles.
Subsequently, it gained financial stability partly due to economic assistance by the Imperial Family, Sekkann-ke regent family, court nobles and so on.
Kakuban and Koyasan
It split into sects because it valued shishisosho, a succession from a teacher to a disciple.
This split was caused by the difference of Jiso (事相), a way to implement Shingon Mikkyo (e.g., a manner of ascetic training).
Dharma itself had been completed by Kukai so that there was no dispute within the sect until the mid-Heian period.
However, at the end of the eleventh century Kakuban (Kogyo Daishi) began to preach the thought of Himitsu Nenbutsu at Koyasan.
Additionally, Kakuban built Daidenpo-in and revitalized Daidenpo-e in order to promote Shingon Dharma.
He tried to achieve the independence of Koyasan from To-ji Temple's control, whereby he abolished the custom whereby Toji-Choja became the head priest of Kongobu-ji Temple at the same time and was ordained to be Kongobu-ji Temple's head priest; however, his effort failed due to the objection of the Kongobu-ji side (Hon-ji side).
Subsequently, he resigned as head priest and retired at Mt. Negoro (Wakayama Prefecture).
After this incident, the Kongobu-ji side (Hon-ji side, 本寺方) continued to fight against Daidenpo-in (inside, 院方), and this continued for a long time.
The two sides split into the Kogi (Kogi Shingon sect) and Shingi (Shingi Shingon sect).
In 1290 Raiyu relocated Daidenpo-in to Mt. Negoro and established the base of the Shingi Shingon sect's Dharma by Kajihosshinsetsu (加持法身説) (Shingi) of Dainichinyorai.
Negoro-ji Temple, founded at Mt. Negoro (including Daidenpo-in) was in its ascendancy but was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1585.
Consequently, Senyo went into Hase-dera Temple in 1588, which came to be the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Buzan-ha.
In 1601 Genyu rebuilt Chishakuin Temple (which had relocated to the precincts of Neogro-ji Temple) at Shichijo, in Kyoto, doing so with Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's support, and later it became the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Chisan-ha.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) To-ji Temple's priests such as Goho and Kenpo completed Tojifujimonkyogaku (東寺不二門教学) and taught Honchikajisetsu (本地加持説) (Kogi) of Dainichinyorai.
During the Edo period, the Edo bakufu carried out a new control measure over religions, against Buddhist sects.
Counter to the Shingon sect, Hatto acts against To-ji Temple, Daigo-ji Temple and Koyasan Gakuryogata, as well as Hatto act against Kanto Shingon sect Kogi (関東真言宗古義法度) were put into effect in 1604.
As a result of these acts, the Shingon sect was placed under bakufu's (government) observation.
After the Meiji Restoration, the Meiji government promoted the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism.
This resulted in the exclusion of Buddhism.
The temples of the Shingon sect suffered great damage without regard to their status as head temples or sub-temples.
Regarding financial matters, the Meiji government forced them to return their wealth.
There was a case of confiscation involved.
Privileges were abolished, and the title of Chokugansho, the temple in which emperors prayed, and Monzeki--the temple where the Imperial Prince lived--were prohibited.
Consequently, many temples began to experience difficulties in their management, so that they were forced to become defunct.
Some monks left the priesthood and returned to secular life.
There is a strong admiration for Kukai, the founder of the sect (Kobo Daishi).
In the tenth century Nyujoshinko, the faith in which Kukai had fallen into deep meditation, was created at Koyasan.
One of the characteristics of the Shingon sects is the preaching of faith in Kobo-daishi (faith in Daishi).
The founder of the sect, Kukai (774-835) was born at Byobu-ga-ura Sanuki-no-kuni (讃岐国屏風浦) (current Zentsu-ji City, Kagawa Prefecture); and as a thinker, writer and talented calligrapher from among the Sanpitsu (the three great calligraphers of history), as well as a Buddhist, he had a strong influence on Japanese culture in later years.
He went to Tang on the ship "Kentoshi" in 804, and was given an essential Dharma of Mikkyo from Eka, of Shoryu-ji Temple, in Choan.
He obtained many Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist altar pieces and a Buddhist picture in Tang, and brought them to Japan.
In 816 Kukai obtained the land of Koyasan (Koya-cho, Itogun, Wakayama Prefecture) and founded Kongobu-ji Temple there; later (in 823), the Emperor Saga gave him To-ji Temple, which was a national temple of Heian-kyo, and he made these temples the fundamental dojo of Shingon Mikkyo.
On March 21, 835, he fell into deep meditation at the age of 62 at Koyasan.
In 921, 86 years after Kukai's demise, the Emperor Daigo awarded him the posthumous title of Kobo Daishi.
A legend holds that there were eight forefathers during the time in which Mikkyo occurred in India; this was conveyed to Kukai (Kobo Daishi) through China, and subsequently Kukai established the Shingon sect.
This is called Shingon Hasso.
There are two kinds of Hasso--Fuho Hasso (eight forefathers from Dainichinyorai to Kukai) and Denji Hasso (eight forefathers who appeared during the period of history in which the teachings of the Shingon sect had been introduced to Japan)--and Kukai described the origin of Shingon Mikkyo, the biographies of the seven forefathers of Fuho and seven forefathers of Denji (seven forefathers of Fuso and Denji Hasso except Kobo-daishi) and lineage of Fuho in his works 'Himitsu Mandala Kyo Fuho Den (秘密曼荼羅教付法伝)' and 'Shingon Fuho Den (真言付法伝).'
One of the characteristics of temples of the Shingon sect is that Shingon Hasso (Denji Hasso) are enshrined in the main hall or other places (they are often drawn as pictures).
(Some temples do not enshrine them.)
This shows the orthodox lineage of the Shingon sect Dharma.
It was when Kongosatta heard Dainichinyorai's sermon that the Shingon Dharma's lineage began.
Dainichinyorai
Kongosatta
Ryumyo Bosatsu
Ryuchi Bosatu
Kongochisanzo
Fukusanzo
Keika Ajari
Kobo-daishi
It means that eight forefathers who appeared during the period of history in which the teachings of the Shingon sect had been introduced to Japan.
Dainichinyorai and Kongosatta were removed from Fuho Hasso because they were not historical figures, and consequently the other two forefathers were added.
They are also called Hasso Daishi.
Each forefather has a belonging that illustrates the essence of enlightenment.
It was said that Ryuju Bosatsu had been given Mikkyo sutras from Kongosatta, an immediate pupil of Dainichinyorai, and thus conveyed them in this world.
(He holds Sankosho in the right hand.)
Ryuchi Bosatsu: he was initiated into Mikkyo from Ryumyo.
(He has sutras in the right hand.)
Kongochisanzo went to Tang and conveyed "Kongocho-kyo" after he learned Mikkyo from Ryuchi in India.
(He has a beadroll in his right hand.)
Fukusanzo was born in western China.
He went to Tang with his uncle, a merchant, and became a disciple of Kongochi at Choan.
He translated 'Kongocho-kyo' into Chinese, and opened Kanjo Dojo.
(He makes Gebaku-in, a symbolic Buddhist gesture, with his fingers.)
Zenmuisanzo was born in India.
He learned Mahayana Buddhism and took over Mikkyo.
He went to Tang at the age of 80, and conveyed the Dainichi-kyo sutra.
(He holds up the index finger of his right hand.)
Zen master Ichigyo was born in China.
He studied Zen, Tendai Dharma, astronomy and mathematics.
He learned from Zenmui at Choan, and completed 'Dainichikyo-sho' based on the dictations of Zenmui.
(Clothed in his clerical garb, he makes a symbolic gesture with his fingers.)
Keika Ajari was born in China.
He took over the Mikkyo of Vajradhatu and Garbhadhatu.
(He is seated on a chair and has a child serve beside him.)
Kobo-daishi was given both Vajradhatu and Garbhadhatu from Keika Ajari, and he founded Shingon Mikkyo by conveying them.
Kukai
(He has five-prong pestles on his right hand and a rosary in his left hand.)
The dharmas of the Shingon sect are Sokushin Jobutsu (becoming Buddha in this life) and Mitsugonkokudo (esoterically adorned Buddha's Land).
The main image is Dainichinyorai, which is an entity of the universe and the absolute truth.
The fundamental sutra is Dainichi-kyo Sutra (formally, 'Daibirushanajobutsu-Jinpenkaji-kyo Sutra') and Kongocho-kyo (formally, 'Kongocho Issainyorai Shinjitsusetsudaijogensho Daikyoo-kyo' or 'Kongocho-Yuga-Shinjitsu-Daio-kyo Sutra,' 'Soshitsuji-kyo Sutra,' 'Yugi-kyo Sutra,' 'Yoryakunenju-kyo Sutra,' 'Rishu-kyo Sutra,') and so on.
The ronso (academic papers) are 'Bodaishinron,' 'Shakumakaenron,' 'Dainichi-kyoso' and so on.
The following works of Kukai are considered to be ronso: 'Himitsu-Mandala-Jujushinron (Jujushinron),' 'Hizo-Hoyaku,' 'Benkenmitsu-Nikyoron,' 'Sokushinjobutsu-gi,' 'Shojijisso-gi,' 'Un-jigi' and so on.
According to the Dharma, ascetic training of the Three Mysteries (the Secret of the Body, i.e., making symbolic gestures with the fingers; the Secret of Speech, i.e., reciting Shingon; and the Secret of Mind, i.e., visualization of the Buddha in the Mandala picture) leads to integration with the main image and Sokushin Jobutsu, which means that one becomes Buddha with one's present physical body.
Jiso' and 'Kyoso' are considered important in the learning of Shingon Mikkyo.
Jiso is a word (as opposed to Kyoso) and a way to implement Shingon Mikkyo.
It means a manner of ascetic training (修法) (training manners (行法) such as Kanjo, rite, Kanpo (meditation, 観法) and Ingei (sign made with the fingers, 印契), Shingon), while Kyoso is a theory of Shingon Mikkyo.
Dainichi-kyo Sutra, the main sutra of the Shingon sect, is a sutra of Kyoso, and Kongocho-kyo is a sutra of Jiso.
Learning Kyoso leads to an understanding of Shingon Mikkyo theory, and learning Jiso leads to the implementation of a theory.
Jiso, without any support of Kyoso, simply becomes a meaningless activity.
Without learning both Jiso and Kyoso, one cannot reach the ideal of Shingon Mikkyo.
To explain the importance of learning both Jiso and Kyoso, some have compared Jiso and Kyoso to two wheels on a single cart.
Additionally, Jiun said, 'Kyoso does not exist without Jiso and Jiso does not exist without Kyoso, so that we should learn them together and try to attain Mitsugi (the Dharma of Mikkyo)(密義).'
The research of Jiso has been popular since the mid-ninth century (during the mid-Heian period).
Yakushin began Hirosawa-ryu school, and Shoho began Ono-ryu school.
Both schools separated into six schools each, e.g. Yataku Juni-ryu (12 schools of Yataku, also called Konpon Juni-ryu (12 schools of basics)), and ultimately they became 36 schools.
Later, the number of schools exceeded 100.
The schools of Shingon Mikkyo's Jiso were all derived from two schools: Hirosawa-ryu and Ono-ryu.
Hirosawa-ryu and Ono-ryu (Yataku Juni-ryu)
During the mid-Heian period, Yakushin began Hirosawa-ryu school and Shoho began Ono-ryu school.
Both schools split into six schools and called themselves Yataku Juni-ryu or Konpon Juni-ryu.
In the definition of Yataku Juni-ryu, Jimyoiin-ryu is not included in Hirosawa-ryu.
Moreover, Nakanoin-ryu is not included in Ono-ryu.
This is because both schools had moved to Koyasan.
These are distinguished simply because they play no role in Kujo no Shuho (official Mikkyo rites, 公請の修法) such as Goshichinichimishiho (annual Shingon prayer ritual), so that Yataku Juni-ryu does not include all the schools of Tomitsu Jiso (東密事相).
It is characterized by the high value that is placed on Giki (rules of rites,儀軌).
It was named after the place name of Hensho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) built by Kancho, which lies in the south of Hirosawa-no-ike Pond (in the Saga Hirosawa, Ukyo ward of Kyoto City).
In a broad sense, when Tomitsujiso is divided in two, it is the school as opposed to Ono-ryu.
In a narrow sense, Ninna-san-ryu (within the school of Hirosawa-ryu) and Hirosawa-san-ryu are together called Hirosawa-roku-ryu.
However, which of the schools should be included in Roku-ryu is not established, and there is a theory that includes Hokuin-ryu and Jisonin-ryu in the lineage of Kannonin-ryu and Ninna-goryu.
Hojuin-ryu, Ninna-goryu and Nishinoin-ryu are called Ninna-san-ryu, and Kezoin-ryu, Ninnikusen-ryu and Denpoin-ryu are called Hirosawa-san-ryu.
The simplified lineage of Hirosawa-ryu schools
Ninna-goryu simplified lineage (founder, Kakuho): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Kakuho
Nishinoin-ryu simplified lineage (founder, Shinsho (信証)): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Shinsho
Hojuiin-ryu simplified lineage (founder, Eigen): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Eigon

Denpoin-ryu simplified lineage (founder, Kakuban): Kukai - Shinga - Gennin - Yakushin - Kanpyo Hoo (Emperor Uda) - Kancho - Saishin - Shoshin - Kanjo - Kakuban
It is characterized by the high value that is placed on the instruction of the secrets.
It was named after the place name of the Yamashina Ono, Higashiyama ward of Kyoto City, the site of Zuishinin grand head temple of the Shingon sect Zentsuji-ha (真言宗善通寺派大本山随心院) (formerly called Mandala Temple).
In some cases Shobo is regarded as an originator (元祖) of Ono-ryu while Ningai, who founded Zuishinin, is regarded as a founder (流祖) of Ono-ryu.
In a broad sense, it was the school that was opposed to Hirosawa-ryu when Tomitsujiso was divided in two.
In a narrow sense it indicates Daigo-san-ryu (Rishoin-ryu, Sanpoin-ryu and Kongooin-ryu) and Kajuji-san-ryu (Zuishinin-ryu, Anshoji-ryu, Kajuji-ryu).
In other cases it indicates only Zuishinin-ryu.
The simplified lineage of Ono-ryu schools

The Shingon sect is one of the sects that have many schools among Buddhist sects in Japan.
Generally, it has developed a wide variety of dharma since it split into the Kogi Shingon sect and Shingi Shingon sect at the end of the thirteenth century.
It relies on Dharma-Kaya of Hon-ji, of Dainichinyorai (Kogi).
It preaches that each event and each thing in this world is a sermon of Dainichinyorai, Buddhism's highest form of existence (the truth itself is regarded as Buddha's body).
It was begun by Kakuban (Kogyo Daishi) and relies on the Dharma of Adhisthana-kaya of Dainichinyorai (Shingi).
It preaches that each event and each thing in this world is a sermon of Dainichinyorai, Adhisthana-kaya.
Consequent upon the enactment of Religious Organizations Act in 1939, Shingon sects (except for the Shingon Risshu) were integrated as the Shingon sect.
However, after World WarⅡmany sects split and became independent one after another, so that today there are more than 50 schools.
The 18 grand head temples of the main 16 schools were set up as the Grand Head Temple's association of Shingon sect schools (Kakuzankai) on June 15, 1958, in order to communicate with each other, cultivate mutual friendships and hold events in cooperation with one another.
These temples are called the 18 head temples of the Shingon sect (真言宗十八本山).

Goshichinichinomishiho is also called Shingoninmishiho and others, and is commonly known as Mishiho.
Because Kukai (Kobo-daishi) had prayed for the peace of Japan, the safety of the Emperor and the prosperity of the people at the Imperial Palace in 834, it was held annually as a New Year event of the Imperial Palace.
Although there were several interruptions, including civil war during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), it was revived through the efforts of the Emperor Go-Mizuono and Gien, Daigo-ji Temple's head priest in 1623, after an absence of 170 years.
It was held until 1871, when it was abolished under the influence of the official decree on the exclusion of Buddhism.
It was revived through a petition by Unsho SHAKU and others in 1883.
Subsequently, the place of ascetic training was moved from the Palace to Kanjo-in of To-ji Temple.
The ascetic training is held 21times.
Participants use Kongokai-ho and Taizokai-ho alternately, one year each, and implement the rites of peace and increase of benefit, and Godai-myoo (五大明王), Juni-ten (十二天), Shoten-ho (聖天法) and so on.
On the first day (開白) of January 8, the imperial messenger, who has the Karabitsu (Chinese-style chest) in which the Emperor's cloth is placed, is sent from the Imperial Household Agency to Kanjo-in of To-ji Temple, and he places it within the inner hall of To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo.
On the 11th (the middle day, 中日) and the 14th (expiration of term of a vow), the imperial messenger burns incense and worships at To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo.
On the 14th, a ceremony to return the Emperor's cloth to the imperial messenger is held at the front hall of To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo, and Goshichinichinomishiho ends successfully (成満).
This is regarded as the supreme secret ceremony of the Shingon sect, and religious articles (法具) such as a rosary, five-pronged pestles, a stole and others, which are used in ascetic training, were brought by Kukai (Kobo-daishi) from Tang (China).
Previously, Toji-Choja played a role of Dai Ajari.
Currently, the role of Dai Ajari, who holds ascetic training (the more specific name is Homuhoin Dai Ajari (法務法印大阿闍梨), commonly known as Daia (大阿)) is alternated by the chief abbots of each sect belonging to the grand head temple's association of Shingon sect schools every year, and after serving as Dai Ajari he is installed as the chief abbot of the Shingon sect.
The term of service is one year.
Customarily, he is given the staff of the chief abbot at the time of inauguration.
For the time after the expiration of the term of a vow, To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo is open to the public and anyone can worship there.
The Soto sect is one of the five Zen sects of China (Rinzai, Igyo, Soto, Unmon and Hogen) and one of the five Zen sects (Nihon Daruma, Rinzai, Soto, Obaku and Fuke) in Japan.
Its head temples are Eihei-ji Temple (Fukui Prefecture) and Soji-ji Temple (Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama City).
Unlike the Rinzai sect, it does not make use of koans (paradoxical anecdotes or riddles used in Zen Buddhism to achieve enlightenment through meditation), practising instead Mokusho Zen (literally, "the zen of silent enlightenment"), which focuses exclusively on mediation.
The Soto sect in Japan was introduced by Dogen.
Dogen went to the Southern Sungs during the Kamakura period, studied under Nyojo TENDO of the Soto sect at Mt. Tendo, and came back to Japan in 1226.
Dogen himself considered his teaching as the 'True Dharma' and denied sectionalism.
For this reason he prohibited his disciples from using a particular sect's name by themselves and conveyed a feeling of rejection when viewed as one of the Zen sects.
It is said that he told them to use the name 'Busshin sect' if they were compelled to identify themselves.
Triggered by joining one of the Nihon Daruma sect groups that were persecuted by Kofuku-ji Temple, after Dogen's nirvana they gradually began to proclaim themselves as one of the Zen sects.
'Soto,' as the name of the sect, came into use during the age of the fourth Jokin KEIZAN and the subsequent Shoseki GAZAN,
While the Rinzai sect was supported by the military government at the time and had political and cultural influence, the Soto sect spread among local lords, local ruling families, low warriors and common people.
The 'True Dharma of Buddhism' traditionally respects Shaka as a main image--'Namu Shakamuni-butsu'--and focuses on meditation, mainly with 'the mind itself is Buddha' as its center.
As opposed to the Chinese Zen tradition, the seated meditation of the Soto sect usually focuses on 'shikan-taza' (single-mindedly sitting in meditation) based on Dogen's teaching of 'Shushoichinyo' (immeasurable ascetic training as a way toward becoming Buddha), while a few styles use Zen questions for meditation (meditation for enlightenment), as does the Rinzai sect.
Moreover, "Shobogenzo," which was written by Dogen, fully describes Buddhism and is different from the view of Chinese Zen, which proclaims Furyumonji (不立文字).
As of 2005, it chants the three slogans of 'human rights,' 'peace' and 'environment.'
The sutras mainly recited
"Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo)"
"Myohorengekyo Kanzeonbosatsu fumonhon"
"Myohorengekyo Nyoraijuryohon"
"Daihishindarani"
"Kanromon Sutra"
"Sandokai Sutra"
"Hokyozanmai Sutra"
"Shariraimon Sutra"
The basic soroku (sutras described by masters)
"Shobogenzo": Dogen's description (incomplete;
edited later by disciples)
"Denkoroku": Keizan's sermon, put together by his disciples
"Shushogi Sutra" was edited from "Shobogenzo" for the benefit of believers during the Meiji period.

The chief priest of each head temple is called the chief abbot, and every two years one of the two chief abbots takes a turn as the superintendent priest.
Approximately 15,000 temples of this sect are separated into Yudo-kai of Eihei-ji ha and Sowa-kai of Soji-ji ha, and every four years the Shumusocho（宗務総長) is selected from both groups.
For seven division managers (部長) of the office (内局), as cabinet members half are elected from both groups, and for the members of an assembly （宗議会議員）(72 seats) each member is elected from both groups in 36 areas.
The related school juridical persons are split into Komazawa University, Tohoku Fukushi University of Eiheiji-ha, Aichi Gakuin University and Tsurumi University of Sojiji-ha, and each group has a right to appoint those presidents in practice.
Eihei-ji Temple - Eiheiji-cho, Fukui Prefecture (the chief abbot Zen master Taiho FUKUYAMA)
It was founded by Dogen in 1244, as requested by Yoshishige HATANO of Echizen Province.
Eihei-ji Temple's branch temple, Chokoku-ji Temple - Minato Ward, Tokyo
Eihei-ji Temple's Nagoya branch temple - Daikan-cho, Higashi Ward, Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture
Eihei-ji Temple's Kagoshima branch temple, Shoryu-ji Temple - Matsubara, Aira-gun, Kagoshima Prefecture
Soji-ji Temple -Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama City (chief abbot, Zen master Kosen Omichi)
It was founded by Jokin KEIZAN in 1321 at Monzen-machi, Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, as requested by JOKEN Risshi of the Noto-no-kuni, in Noto Province.
It was destroyed by fire in 1898 and was moved to the present location in 1911.
Sojiji-soin (總持寺祖院) was reconstructed at the original site (Monzen-machi, Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture) in 1905.
Hogen-ji Temple - Matsushiro, Matsumae-cho, Matsumae-gun, Hokkaido
Historically, Shobo-ji Temple (Oshu City, Iwate Prefecture) was the head temple for the two Ou provinces, and Daiji-ji Temple (Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture) was for a while the head temple of Kyushu; however, Eihei-ji Temple and Soji-ji Temple became head temples based on the Act for Temples in 1615.
The Nyorai sect (Nyorai-kyo) was founded in Nagoya in 1802 by Kino ISSONNYORAI.
It had been a temple of the Soto sect since 1884, but ultimately it gained independence through the implementation of the Religious Corporation Act in 1951.
Its dharma is a mixture of a faith for the guardian deity of seafaring, a faith for the purity of the land and others, so that it does not have a strong relationship with the dharma of the Soto sect.
Issonkyodan, the derivative sect mentioned above
Active mainly in Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture
Guze-kyo was established in Niigata by Choan DAIDO in 1886 as a derivation from the Soto sect.
It saw as the main image Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu, who is the Nyorai with great compassion and mercy, and insisted upon relief in the present world by the extreme power of Kannon Bosatsu, which does not consider its own power or that of others (自力他力).
Its dedicated efforts on behalf of social welfare became widespread throughout Japan, but it declined rapidly after Choan DAIDO's nirvana in 1908, partly due to the lack of a successor.
Hoo-kyo was a "popular" religious movement that Doken TAKADA promoted in the latter part of the Meiji period and the Taisho period.
Doken had continued activities such as meditation meetings and sermon visits based at the Seisho-ji Temple, but from the beginning of the Taisho period, he put an emphasis on the promotion of lay Buddhism by publishing monthly magazines or holding lecture meetings without regard to the Soto sect's dharma.
He called his activities 'Hoo-kyo,' meaning 'Buddhism based on Hoo Daisho Shakamunibutsu's true heart.'
After Doken's nirvana in 1923, the movement, which had its own sect name, finished.
Additionally, because Doken retained his title as a monk of the Soto sect until he died, 'Hoo-kyo' is generally considered to be a movement within the Soto sect as opposed to an independent sect.
Sanpo-kyodan was founded by Hakuun YASUTANI in 1954 in Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture, after his withdrawal from the Soto sect.
It built such an original way of training as to place Doken's teaching at the center and use Zen koans for meditation.
Today it focuses on the teaching of meditation for lay people and has bases for Zen meditation abroad.
Other than the foregoing, there are a few independent temples of the Soto sect:
Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu,（अवलोकितेश्वर Avalokiteśvara in Sanskrit) is a sacred image (一尊) of Bosatsu in Buddhism and a kind of Buddha (尊格) that has attained widespread faithful since ancient times, particularly in Japan.
It is also called 'Kanzeon Bosatsu' or 'Kanjizai Bosatsu.'
It has many other names such as 'Kuse Bosatsu' or 'Guse Bosatsu.'
Origin of name
A superior thesis at present regarding the Sanskrit Avalokiteśvara is that it was mixture of words, ava (universally) +lokita (see, saw) + īśvara (universalist).
A translation by Genjosanzo, 'Kanjizai Bosatsu' can be seen as having adopted that thesis.
It is pointed out that the origin relates to the goddess Anahita, a daughter of Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism and Laksmi in the Indian mythology.
In an old translation by Kumaraju, it was called Kanzeon Bosatsu, while at that time the name in China was also Kanzeon Bosatsu.
Accordingly, there is a thesis that it was translated freely, complying with the point of Kannon-gyo Sutra (Myoho Renge-kyo Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumon Hon No. 25, 妙法蓮華経観世音菩薩普門品第二十五).
Additionally, in the old Sanskrit "Hoke-kyo Sutra," which was discovered in Central Asia, it was written as 'avalokitasvara,' so that it can be interpreted as avalokita (see) + svara (sound); there is another old translation as "Koseon Bosatsu," so that it is possible to assume these were different texts.
Because the character "世" could not be used due to the taboo against using the name of the second Tang Emperor Shi Min LI, it became established as Kannon Bosatsu after the Tang period in China.
It was translated as Kanjizai Bosatsu in the new version after Genjosanzo.
Kanjizai means that contemplation with prajna leads to the religious fruit (妙果) of the universalist.
Moreover, it is also called semuisha (施無畏者), the person who gives one a fearless mind, or guse daishi (救世大士), who can relieve this world.
Faith
Based on Kannon-gyo Sutra and others, it is widely believed and worshiped.
In addition, it is the Bosatsu who appears in the beginning of Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo) and is a symbol of Hannya's prajna as well.
In Jodo-kyo, it is often placed as an attendant of Amidanyorai with Seishi Bosatsu by the preaching of Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra.
The fundamental sword (本誓） of Kannon Bosatsu is great compassion and mercy.
In Japan it had been shaped into a statue from the Asuka period and, linked with practical benefits in this world, it is widely believed without regard to time and place.
It has a suibyo (a small water bottle).
It is said that in the suibyo there is kudokusui (功徳水), meaning water that never dries up.
The pure land where Kannon lives is called Potaraka (Fudaraku) and is preached in 'Kegon-kyo Sutra' as 補怛落迦 of 摩頼矩咤国 in southern India.
Kanzeon Bosatsu is often assumed to be a female, as in the term 'Jibo (affectionate mother) Kannon.'
This is because Jizo Bosatsu is seen as a pair of Ichi-Sendai-Daihi-Sendai(一闡提大悲闡提) like Kannon, and many Kannon statues have feminine faces while Jizo is a male monk.
Because Shaka calls Kannon 'zennanshi, a man who believes Buddhism' in Sutras and there is a word 'Kannon Daishi,' it was originally regarded as a male; however, in Kannon-gyo Sutra it gives a sermon with a feminine appearance to women (婦女身得度者、即現婦女身而為説法) so that gradually it has been assumed to have no sexuality.
In later ages it tends to be seen as female.
This is because the faith for Kannon spread widely from Fudaraku (Zhoushan islands and the east-central Chinese province of Zhejiang), a great holy place, to the East China Sea and Huang Hai, so that it came to be related to the folk faith of praying for a safe voyage and the faith in goddesses such as Matsu (of Taoism).
Therefore, some people discuss the sexuality of Kannon, associating it with 'Henjo Nanshi (変成男子)' in Hoke-kyo sutra, but apparently there is no relationship between them.
When Kannon relieves people in this world, it changes its appearance in various ways according to the person's mind (character or ability to understand the teachings of Buddhism).
This is called Fumonjigen (普門示現) by Kannon.
According to 'Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumon Hon No. 25' of the Hoke-kyo (Kannon-gyo) sutra, in order to provide relief to all people, Kanzeon Bosatsu adopts one of 33 different appearances to meet the needs of the particular person; these appearances include 'Busshin,' 'Shomonshin,' and 'Bonnoshin' (as below).
The number '33,' which is seen in the names such as the 33 Temples of Saigoku (西国三十三箇所) or Sanjusangendo (33-gendo) Temple, stems from this.
Additionally, '33 Kannon' (see below) came to be believed based on the concept of Hoke-kyo Sutra in China and modern Japan, but there is no description of the 33 Kannon's names in Hoke-kyo sutra.
This idea of Fumonjigen led to the creation of various appearances of Kannon, such as Roku Kannon, Shichi Kannon, Jugoson Kannon and Sanjyu-san Kannon.
For this reason there are various shapes of statues of the Kannon, called Henge (Changed) Kannon (other than the basic Sho Kannon).
Unlike the perception of Kannon as an attendant of Amidanyorai, Kannon Bosatsu, which was worshiped as an independent Buddha, tends to be prayed to for practical benefits in this world.
Therefore, it is often portrayed as having a superhuman appearance with many faces and many hands, this being from the viewpoint of relieving all people and achieving all people's wishes.

In the Shingon sects Sho Kannon, Juichimen Kannon (i.e. Kannon with 11 faces (十一面観音), Senju Kannon, Bato Kannon, Nyoirin Kannon and Jundei Kannon are called Roku Kannon (six Kannon), and in the Tendai sects Fukukensaku Kannon is added to Roku Kannon instead of Jundei Kannon.
The image of Roku Kannon was created from the idea that six kinds of Kannon relieve people who have lost their way in six worlds, based on Rokudo (Rokudo Rinne, a belief that every life repeats reincarnation into six types of worlds) as the following combinations show: Jigoku-do (地獄道) - Sho Kannon, Gaki-do (餓鬼道) - Senju Kannon, Chikusho-do (畜生道) - Bato Kannon, Shura-do (修羅道) - Juichimen Kannon, Jin-do (人道) - Jundei Kannon, Ten-do (天道) - Nyoirin Kannon.
Additionally, although Senju Kannon is thought to have 1,000 hands and one eye in each of those hands, many statues show '1,000 hands' using 42 hands because it is difficult to in fact shape 1,000 hands (with minor exceptions such as Toshodai-ji Temple Kondo).
The origin from which Kanzeon Bosatsu got 1,000 hands is "Senjusengen Kanzeon Bosatsu Kodaienmanmugedaihishin Darani-kyo," as translated by Gabon-Datsuma.
Daihishindarani, in the last part of this sutra, is still recited at Zen sect temples in China and Japan.
Shichi Kannon is the seven appearances of Kannon in order to civilize people.
It consists of the six Kannon of the Shingon sects and the Fukukensaku Kannon.
Jyugoson Kannon is the fifteen appearances of 33 Kannon (see next section), i.e. Byakue, Yoe, Suigetsu, Yoryu, Amadai, Tara, Shokyo, Ruri, Ryuzu, Jikyo, Enko, Yuge, Renga, Takimi and Seyaku.
The following names of 33 Kannon are described in "Butsuzozui (仏像図彙)," a book published in 1783.
There are various origins of the 33 Kannon; among them, while some kannons (such as Byakue Kannon and Tarason Kannon) originated in India, others developed uniquely in China and Japan.
Some kannons, such as Byakue Kannon and Yoryu Kannon, are often drawn in Buddhist pictures of Zen sects and in ink wash, but most kannons do not have the independent form of a statue.

Works of fiction in which Kannon Bosatsu appears
Journey to the West, "Monkey King"
In every scene Kannon Bosatsu appears several times to protect Sanzohoshi by the order of Shaka Nyorai.
This story took a hint from the legend that Genjosanzo, a model of Sanzohoshi, traveled to the west with the Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo).
"Feng-Shen-Yen-I"
Kannon Bosatsu, in Buddhism, was depicted as Jiko Shinjin, having been changed by Dokyo during the Ming Dynasty; and there is a character, Jiko Dojin, in a novel "Feng-Shen-Yen-I," which was written at nearly the same time period, and later he became Kannon Bosatsu without any activity as Kannon Bosatsu.
Additionally, in this novel Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu appear as sacred images (天尊) and later come to be Bosatsu of Buddhism, thus showing the rich imagination of the Chinese.
The Obaku sect is a sect of Buddhism in Japan and one of the Zen sects, after the Rinzai and Soto sects.
It was named after Kiun OBAKU (a master of Gigen RINZAI), a monk of Tang.
While the Rinzai and Soto sects have evolved in the Japanese style, the Obaku sect has retained the Ming Dynasty's style in modern times.
The head temple is Obakusan Manpuku-ji Temple in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, which was founded by Ingen.
History
In Japan the Obaku sect was started by Ryuki INGEN, a Zen master of the Chinese Rinzai sect, who was invited from China at the period of Ming and Qing dynasties in 1654, during the early Edo period.
Traditionally, it had invited the chief priest of the temple from China, until Zen Master Ryuto, who in 1740 took up a new position as the fourteenth chief priest of a Buddhist temple.
At the early stage it identified itself as the 'Rinzaisei sect' or 'Rinzaizen sect Obaku-ha,' implying that it transmitted Orthodox Rinzai Zen.
Its style has been influenced by a mixture of Zen, so to speak, which reflects the Kegon, Tendai and Jodo sects and is characteristic of Chinese Zen during the Ming Dynasty.
As background for the protection of the government (the shogunate), it was supported by Japanese feudal lords and made efforts to civilize people through social works by monks such as Doko TETSUGEN, so that it gradually extended its influence.
There are 33 Tatchu (subtemples located in the precincts of a larger temple) of Manpuku-ji Temple, and 'Subtemple Notes' of 1745 recorded 1043 subtemples.
Because the Meiji government's Ministry of Religion restricted Zen to the two sects of Rinzai and Soto in 1874, it was forced to change its name to 'Rinzai sect Obaku-ha'; however, in 1876 it formally gained independence as the Obaku sect, one of the Zen sects.
Zen Master Doko TETSUGEN, who was a successor (法孫) of Ingen, carved out a pattern of Daizo-kyo on a woodblock, which is called "Tetsugen-ban Version (Obaku-ban Version) Issai-kyo Sutra," based on the Daizo-kyo introduced by Ingen describing the trials and tribulations, and published it so that not merely the research of Buddhism in Japan would make dramatic process but the technology of publishing did as well.
On the other hand, Zen Master Ryoo Dokaku helped Tetsugen to carve Issaikyo wood blocks with revenue from the sales of the Chinese herb "kintaien," and he built Kangakuin in many places in order that everyone could read it, thus setting a precedent for the library system in Japan.
After that, Tetugen Issai-kyo Sutra was designated as an important cultural property and was printed continuously at the Hozoin Temple of Obakusan Manpuku-ji Temple.
Obaku Toin
The sutras of the Obaku sect have been recited according to ancient Chinese pronunciation, which is called 'Obaku Toin.'
Shakanyorai (Shikyajirai or Shakamuni-butsu) is a title of respect for Shaka (Kudonshittaruta, Gautama Siddhaartha in Sanskrit, Gotama Siddhatthaa in Pali), a founder of Buddhism, as Buddha.
In Theravada Buddhism (so-called Hinayana), Shakamuni-butsu is regarded as the sole Buddha in this world.
The disciple who achieved supreme enlightenment was called Arakan, and he was positioned as a saint who was delivered from earthly bondage by the sermons of Shaka as Buddha.
According to Mahayana Buddhism, Shakamuni-butsu (Shakanyorai) is one of the immeasurable Buddhas at the ten directions (east, south, west and north, each midpoint, up and down) and three worlds (past, future and present) as well as a Buddha in this corrupt world.
Moreover, Trikaya, the three bodies of Buddha, considers Buddha a figure in front of the people of the present world.
Among the Mahayana Buddhism sects, there is a dispute over who is the main image in Nichiren and Hokke sects; additionally, there is a conflict between a thesis that considers Shaka to be the original Buddha and another that considers it to be Nichiren.
Among these, the main image of the former is Shakamuni-butsu as the original Buddha.
This was argued in the Tendai sect before, but today it is often discussed among the Nichiren and Hokke sects.
This means Shakamuni-seson, who has an immeasurably long life (無量長寿) in Nyorai Juryo Hon No. 16 of the Hoke-kyo sutra.
This does not mean the historical Gautama Siddhartha (Shaka), who flourished in ancient India on the Eurasian Continent, but instead it means the religious Shakamuni-seson, who has existed from ancient times before he was born in India and continues to exist in the future after his nirvana.
According to that thesis, other immeasurable Buddhas are the Trace Buddha, who is only a copy of the original Buddha Shakuson, so that if you see him as the moon the other Buddha will be 1,000 moons reflected in a rice terrace.
It is an object of faith for the groups that consider Shaka to be the original Buddha.
It is also called Kuon Honbutsu, which is reflected in the temple's name as the Nichiren Sect of Buddhism grand head temple Minobusan Kuon-ji Temple (Minamikoma-gun, Yamanashi Prefecture).
Moreover, in the Hoke-kyo Sutra it is stated that Shakanyorai did not become Buddha under the line tree for the first time but had already awakened in an immeasurable past time; in Nehan-gyo sutra there are more descriptions about the future, which states that Nyorai exists forever without any change and ultimately denies Mappo (Age of the Final Dharma) as an expediency.
Therefore, it is said that Hoke-kyo Sutra teaches Kuonjitsujo (久遠実成) and Nehan-gyo Sutra teaches Kuonshochu (久遠常住).
Statues of Shakanyorai were shaped over wide-ranging areas, where Buddhism had spread from India.
Most of them were designed to describe the real Shaka's biography as a picture or to shape a particular scene separately.
In Japan, statue of birth, statue of training, statue of struggling against the devil, statue of a sermon being given and statue of nirvana were shaped.
Among them, the "sermon" statue is the most popular; it expresses the figure of Shaka, who preaches Dharma as indicated by seppo-in, his gesture for a sermon.
For example, the bronze statues at Horyu-ji Temple Kondo in Nara and at Kaniman-ji Temple in Kyoto are famous, as are the wooden figures of Muroo-ji Temple Kondo in Nara and Daihoon-ji Temple in Kyoto.
Additionally, the style of the Seiryoji-type Shakanyorai, which was modeled on Zuizo of Seiryo-ji Temple in Kyoto, is also widespread.
It is often placed on the altars of the Shaka triad.
The two attendants are often Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu.
In the Hokke and Nichiren sects, the style of Sanposon (三宝尊) (Ittoryozon, 一塔両尊) is often adopted.
In this style the Taho Pagoda (pagoda), in which the Nichiren chant is written, is placed at the center, with Shakanyorai on the left side and Tahonyorai on the right side as seen by the person who enshrines, and a statue of Nichiren as a monk is placed under them.

"Journey to the West" remonstrates with Goku SON (Sun Wu Kong), and leads Sanzohoshi to Tenjiku, India.
The role of "Oshakasama" in "Journey to the West" (a TV drama from Fuji Television Network, Inc.) was played by Masaaki SAKAI.
Daibutsu is a popular name meaning a large statue of the Buddha as a Buddhist image.
In the Buddhist region of Asia, such as China, statues of Buddha had been carved into rock faces since ancient times.
In Japan it was the first time that Emperor Shomu built a Daibutsu of Todai-ji Temple in order for the power of the Imperial Court in the ritsuryo system to become widely known through Buddhism.
Since then, large statues of Buddha have been built in many places by people who pursue acts of great piety.
In Japan there are statues of Buddha that are called '○○Daibutsu' in many places, but there is no standard as to how large one should be in order to be called 'Daibutsu.'
Until World WarⅡ, 'Nara Great Buddha,' 'Kamakura Great Buddha' and 'Hyogo Great Buddha' were called 'Nihon Sandaibutsu (three large statues of Buddha in Japan),' but since Hyogo Daibutsu was broken during wartime delivery (the present Hyogo Daibutsu was rebuilt) there is now controversy as to which should be the third Daibutsu next to 'Nara Great Buddha' and 'Kamakura Great Buddha.'
Currently, there are some large statues that are identified as Nihon Sandai Daibutsu: 'the Great Image of Buddha at Takaoka,' 'Hyogo Great Buddha (rebuilt),' 'Nihon-ji Great Buddha,' 'Gifu Great Buddha,' 'Great Buddha of Ushiku,' 'Great Buddha of Tokyo,' 'Great Buddha of Akada' and so on.
A TV program titled "Tamori Club," aired by the TV Asahi Corporation on May 4, 2007, had a special feature on Nihon Sandaibutsu and decided on the third Great Buddha.
Mikkyo is an abbreviation for Himitsu Bukkyo, or esoteric Buddhism.
Among Mikkyo believers it is also called Vajrayana, as opposed to Mahayana Buddhism and Hinayana.
It identifies itself as Buddhism, but among scholars there is controversy as to whether Mikkyo is included in Buddhism or not.
While in Mahayana Buddhism (exoteric Buddhism) dharma is preached broadly to people through words and texts, characteristically in Mikkyo a very mystical and symbolic dharma is transmitted by a master to a disciple within the sect.
The reason that Tibetan Buddhism, which took over Indian Mikkyo, was previously called 'Lamaism' is due to the characteristic that a disciple believes his 'lama' absolutely at the time of transmittal.
The ritual by which to prove that a master has completely transmitted dharma to a disciple is called Denpo Kanjo (伝法灌頂), and the complete transmission of dharma is compared to 'pouring water from a bottle to another bottle without spilling a drop.'
In the background of Mikkyo's establishment was such a social situation that Buddhism was oppressed as Hinduism flourished during the latter period of Indian Buddhism.
Mikkyo tried to revive Indian Buddhism by incorporating the elements of Hinduism into Buddhism.
However, the incorporation of Mikkyo with Indian Buddhism could not limit the growth of Hinduism, and as a result Indian Buddhism declined.
Soon, it was attacked politically and diplomatically from two sides: one, by the Islamic government (Delhi sultanate) that had invaded from northern India, which was ruled by Muslims from Western Asia; and secondly, by the Hindu government of southern India.
Attacked by Islam for its worship of an idol and magical elements, Mikkyo in India was forced to disappear into history as the last stage of Indian Buddhism.
The early stage of Mikkyo, Zo-mitsu (the Mixed Esoteric Buddhism), which was established at the stage when magical elements were incorporated into Buddhism, was not particularly systematized but aimed to gain practical benefits in this world by reciting mantra, Shingon and litany, as well as the spell of each Buddha, being affected by the mantra of Brahmanism, in which religious services were performed.
There was no Mikkyo sutra, and a curse on (咒) and litany were seen in the various sutras of Mahayana Buddhism.
In order to protect against the emergent Hinduism, the middle stage of Mikkyo was established more seriously as a systematized form of Buddhism.
The middle stage of Mikkyo, as opposed to the Mahayana Buddhism in which a form of Shakamuni was preached, compiled Mikkyo sutras consisting of the teachings of 大毘盧遮那仏（Mahāvairocana), or Dainichinyorai by another name.
After the accomplishment of "Dainichi-kyo Sutra," "初会金剛頂経"（Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha） and their commentary, Mandala, which showed the world view of Mikkyo incorporating various Buddhas, was produced; thus the Buddhas of Mikkyo were placed into a hierarchyand systematized, as all Buddhas were created from Issainyorai (一切如来), the Five Buddhas of Wisdom around Dainichinyorai: Gochinyorai (五智如来).
While the middle stage of Mikkyo became a complicated system of Buddhism for priests, it couldn't become widespread among Indian people and therefore couldn't change the trend whereby Hinduism, which emphasized daily religious services and folk beliefs, flourished and expanded.
For this reason, in order to hold out against the flourishing of Hinduism in India, there appeared Funnuson (憤怒尊) and Gohoson (護法尊) to pray for the protection of the training of Buddhism and the surrender of the enemy, such as Gozanze Myoo, who defeated Shiva, and Mahakala, who subdued Ganesha and Gundari Myoo.
Because the middle stage of Mikkyo couldn't hold out against the flourishing of Hinduism, the late-stage of Mikkyo, which valued practice instead of theory, was established.
In the late stage of Mikkyo, the principle of Buddha's nature was pursued.
Accompanied by this, Hosshin Fugen (法身普賢), Gonkosatta and Kongo Soji (金剛総持) became to be respected as 最勝本初仏 mostly.
Additionally, being influenced by the tantora of Shakta Hinduism and Shakti belief, Anunttara-yoga was seen characteristically in the late-stage Mikkyo, which was a training of coalescence (sex) between male principles (mind, wisdom, upaya and Vajradhatu) and female principles (body, feeling, Hannya and Garbhadhatu), so that there appeared joyful Buddha (歓喜仏) which showed that the male Buddha (male principle) and female Buddha (female principle) had sexual intercourse.
In the development of research on yoga tantra, bringing Purana to the top of the head from the lower body was regarded as the best way, and having sexual intercourse was considered the most efficient way for that.
However, because of the ruined morals such as with male priests forcing lay female believers to have sexual intercourse as the best means of devoting their bodies, which they practiced despite the broken precepts, some Buddhists left the late-stage Mikkyo and returned to Theravada Buddhism, which valued the religious precepts.
As a response to criticism against priests' having sexual intercourse, the content of Anunttara-yoga was changed from a practice of having sexual intercourse to one in which intercourse was imagined.
Additionally, since Indian Buddhism was expected to collapse under the Muslim invasion in the political and social situation at that time, the Kala cakra tantra (the last Mikkyo sutra) described the following: the flourishing of Islam; the collapse of Indian Buddhism, a concept of Shambhala; a secret Buddhist land and Utopia, which could be reached only through Mikkyo during the period before the revival of Indian Buddhism (the Age of Final Dharma); Raja Cakravarti (ルドラ・チャクリン（転輪聖王）), who became the thirty-second king of Shambhala; a counterattack by Raja Cakravarti against the invaders (Muslims); the prediction that Raja Cakravarti would destroy the king of evil and his supporters in the final war; the revival of Indian Buddhism in the future; the return to order on earth; the coming of the harmonization and peace of the world, and so on.
The Muslim invasion and destruction in northern India interrupted Buddhism (including Mikkyo in India), but a developed system of late-stage Mikkyo can be seen in Tibetan Buddhism.
In Japan, Mikkyo was first introduced by Saicho (Dengyo Daishi), who had returned from Tang.
The Imperial Family and aristocrats at that time were interested in Mikkyo, which valued practical benefits in this world or "pure land" teachings, as well as Jodo-kyo (Buddhist invocation), which promised reincarnation in the Land-of-Bliss/Pure Land of the next world, instead of the Tendai Doctrine, which Saicho had seriously studied.
However, because Saicho mainly studied the Tendai Doctrine but did not do so with Mikkyo, Mikkyo was introduced more properly by Kukai (Kobo-daishi), who studied it at Shoryuji Temple, Qinglongsi Temple (the basis of Chinese Mikkyo), Engyo, Ennin (Jikaku Daishi), Eun, Enchin (Chisho Daishi) and Shuei.
Among the traditional Buddhist sects in Japan, the Shingon sect (whose teachings Kukai learned from Eka) and the Keika of Shoryuji Temple (Xian City) in China (Tang), thus systematized as Shingon Mikkyo (Toumitsu; Shokushin Jobutsu and the guard of the nation being two aspects), and the Nihon Tendai sect (called Daimitsu in some cases), which was begun by Saicho and established by Ennin, Enchin and Annen, are incorporated into Mikkyo.
While members of the Shingon sect learn Mikkyo independently, members of the Tendai sect learn Tendai, Mikkyo, Buddhist precepts and Zen at the same time.
Tomitsu means the Mikkyo of To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple), and Daimitsu means Tendai Mikkyo.
While Tomitsu and Daimitsu, which were transmitted systematically, are called Jun-mitsu (Pure Esoteric Buddhism), Mikkyo, which had been transmitted in fragments and had adherents before Jun-mitsu, is called Zo-mitsu (Mixed Esoteric Buddhism).
In modern China, Chinese Mikkyo, which flourished in the Tang Dynasty (the middle-stage Mikkyo) is called 唐密宗 and Mikkyo in Tibetan Buddhism continues to be called 西蔵密宗.
Mikkyo, which Kukai, Ennin and Enchin of Japan learned in Tang, was 唐密宗.
唐密宗 declined and was interrupted due to the oppression of Zen and Buddhist invocation (pure-land teachings, Jodo-kyo) after the Tang Dynasty.
In modern China, an effort is being made to revive 唐密宗 through an exchange with the Shingon sect of Japan (Tomitsu) such as Seian-ji Temple in Shanghai, but it is a minor activity.
西蔵密宗 has been believed until now around the autonomous region of Tibet and northern China.
It is considered that the reason that 唐密宗, the middle-stage Mikkyo, declined and was interrupted is that Taoism--which was a rival having the same aspects of practical benefits in this world, as well as mojo--was favored.
It is said that Confucianism also had a strong influence in China, so that the late-stage Mikkyo, which flourished in Tibet, Nepal and Mongolia, was not introduced because tantra was in opposition to sexual morality.
Moreover, there is a hypothesis that Indian alchemy became Mikkyo and that Mikkyo was alchemy itself, but it is not widely accepted and remains untried in Buddhist studies.
By extension, the religion and sects that have mystical and symbolic dharma, such as cabala, kabbalah and Booduism, other than Buddhism, are in some cases referred to as Mikkyo.
It is also called Mitsugi Shukyo (密儀宗教).
Amidanyorai, being Amitaabha or Amitaayus in Sanskrit, is one of the Nyorai in Mahayana Buddhism.
It is also called Amitabha Buddha or Midabustu.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a lotus (a lotus in full bloom in Vajradhatumandala and a blooming lotus in Garbha-mandala).
Shuhi, Shuji or Bija (in Mikkyo) is hriiH.
Amitaayus' in Sanskrit means 'a person who has an immeasurable life,' and 'Amitaabha' means 'a person who has immeasurable light'; these show that he is a super-man who has no limit in time and space.
These are freely translated as 無量寿仏 or 無量光仏 and are regarded as the Buddha of light who shines forth in this dark world.
He has the Buddha land, the Land of Bliss in the west.
Generally, he has been depicted as wearing simple clothes with no accessories and shows a symbolic gesture with the fingers of Kubon Raigo-in, i.e., mudra for the nine possible levels of birth into Amida's paradise, Gokuraku (see Mudra for detail), mixed with Jo-in, i.e., samadhi mudra, Seppo-in, i.e., the exposition of the dharma mudra, Semui-in, i.e., mudra for bestowing fearlessness, and Yogan-in, i.e., wish-granting mudra.
When enshrined as the Amida triad Kyoji, it is accompanied by the attendant figures Kannon-Bosatsu (i.e., Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva) and Seishi-Bosatsu (i.e., Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva).
In Mikkyo, it is admired as one of the Nyorai of the five Buddhas (five Buddhas of wisdom).
According to "Muryoju-kyo Bussetu Muryoju-kyo Sutra," he willingly stepped down from the status of Buddha to Bosatsu and practiced ascetic training for the relief of all the living things under Lokeshvararaja Buddha, with the name Dharmakara.
He is the sambhoga-kaya Buddha who had thought about the relief of living things for a very long time (contemplation of five kalpas) and became Buddha by finding a way to achieve birth in the pure land.
He made 48 wishes for the relief of living things; among them the eighteenth wish, called 'Hongwan (本願),' is highly valued, particularly in Jodo-kyo.
Additionally, it is considered that he continues to preach even now.
In "Amida-kyo Sutra" he was praised by as many Buddhas as there were grains of sand in the Ganges River of the universe.
It says 'The power of Amidabutsu was extremely wonderful, and only Amidabutsu wished Hongwan and promised for the relief of all living things despite other Buddhas turning their backs against the relief of us, meaning the deadly, guilty living things.'
No Buddha could reach enlightenment as Buddha without ultimately depending on Amidabutsu.
The phrase Tariki (Other-Power) Hongwan originated from this, and has been generally used in the sense of 'selfish dependence on others' or 'irresponsible,' in the broad sense.
However, Other-Power here originally showed the power of Amidanyorai, while all other powers except his (but including Shaka's power) are called Jiriki (Self-Power).
Particularly in the Jodo Shinshu sect, an ignorant, deluded person with earthly desires can become Buddha 'only' by Amidanyorai's Hongwan, as it were, or Tariki Hongwan (absolutely Other-Power), and even the power of Shaka as Buddha is denied as 'Self-Power.'
In Tibetan Buddhism, 無量寿仏 is distinguished from 無量光仏.
Amidanyorai in Japan is near to the latter.
Furthermore, Panchen Lama, the second rank of dGe lugs pa, is regarded as an avatar of 無量光仏.
According to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, he appears for the relief of the soul four days after death (next to Dainichinyorai, Ashukunyorai and Hoshonyorai).
It is the Buddha who appeared in Mahayana Buddhism, and there is a theory that it originates from an Iranian faith such as Zoroastrianism.
According to that theory, Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of light, is an original model of 無量光如来 and Zurvan, the god of immeasurable time, is an original model of 無量寿如来.
Additionally, there is a theory that the area of Iran, the original place of Zoroastrianism and the area of ancient Babylonia, which were fertile and flourished, served as the basis for the Western Land of Bliss.
Since the Kamakura period in Japan, the words and phrases related to Amidanyorai had been seen in fully flourished Jodo-kyo.
Ohako, one's favorite stunt
As mentioned above, since the eighteenth wish among the 48 wishes in Jodo-kyo is seen to be the most important, Ohako (i.e., the eighteenth) means one's favorite stunt.
Amidakuji, lottery
The origin of this word is that although Amidakuji at present is shown in parallel lines, formerly it was shown in radiating lines, which looked like the halo of an Amidanyorai statue.
Tariki Hongwan
As mentioned above, it is used to show irresponsibility or a lack of effort, as transferred from the original meaning.

Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva in Sanskrit) is one of the Buddhas of Buddhism.
It is called Jishi Bosatsu, as freely translated from the Sanskrit name.
Azana (字), another name, is Ajita and is translated as 無勝等.
He was born in Varanasi, India, studied under Shakabutsu and was given a clarification to become Buddha in the future.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a tower on a lotus and a wise bottle (suihei, a small water bottle).
Shushi, Shuji, Bija in Mikkyo is yu.
Miroku (Maitreya) is a Bosatsu who is promised to become Buddha next to Gotama Siddhartha (Shakamuni-butsu, Buddha at present); it is said that he appears in the future 5670 million years after Gotama Siddhartha's demise and will bring relief to many people.
It is said that he is presently in ascetic training (or that he preaches) at Tosotsuten; the belief in going to Tosotsuten of Miroku Bosatsu (上生信仰) after death was popular in China, Korea and Japan.
Generally, it is believed that Miroku appears 5670 million years later; such enormous years originating from the formula 4000×400×360＝576000000, based on the belief that the life of Miroku at Tosotsuten is 4000 years and a day at Tosotsuten equals 400 years in this world (it is thought that 576000000 years changed to 5670000000 years during a later age).
The other old Buddhism sutra asserts that he appears 3000 years later, so that the time when future Buddha appears is not certain in a precise sense; another thesis claims it's a metaphor for 'the distant future.'
It is said that Miroku Bosatsu appears as Brahman in this corrupt world, obtains enlightenment under the Ryuge-ju tree (竜華樹) after becoming a priest in the same way as Siddhartha, and brings people relief by preaching three times (which is called Ryuge-sankai, the three sermons at Ryuge).
There is a description in "Maitreyavyakaranas" that he brings relief to 9.6 billion people the first time, 9.4 billion people the second time and 9.2 billion people the third time.
Additionally, he is called Miroku-nyorai or Miroku-butsu by taking in advance the figure of appearance 5670 million years later in some cases.
The statue called 'Great Buddha of Trial' at Todai-ji Temple is 'the seated statue of Miroku-nyorai (wooden figure)', which is small at less than 40 cm high, but it looks heavy.
In the faith for Miroku, there are 下生信仰 as well as 上生信仰, and the former was more popular in China.
While 上生信仰 is a wish to be relieved again at Tosotsuten of Miroku Bosatsu, 下生信仰 is the faith that we have to be ready for Miroku Bosatsu's appearance 'at present' rather than 5670 million years in the future.
As opposed to 上生信仰, which is similar to the Pure Land Faith, 下生信仰 is a kind of eschatology and a hope for the savior's appearance such as that this world should be changed in accordance with Miroku's appearance (下生).
For this reason there were many examples in each period where 下生信仰 was utilized by dissident groups or 下生信仰 groups became anti-establishment.
大乗の乱 of the northern Wei dynasty and Byakuren sect in the northern Sung dynasty, the southern Sung, the Yuan, the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty were good examples of them.
During the age of civil war in Japan, the faith that Miroku Bosatsu would appear in this world was popular and the appearance of 'the world of Miroku-butsu' as Utopia in this world was expected.
Although it is a kind of messianism, it shows the strong idea of an agricultural people that considers Miroku as a spirit of grain and that the world of Miroku is a peaceful world with a good harvest of rice.
Based on this idea, the belief that Miroku's ship came from the Eastern sea spread along the coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean, which can be seen as a style of the Miroku Odori dance (弥勒踊り).
During the Edo period it was mixed with the faith for Fuji, and trainees of Fuji-ko and Jikigyo Miroku were seen from 1688 to 1703.
Additionally, it is pointed out that peasant revolts, particularly the revolt for social reform, was strongly influenced by the Miroku faith.
観弥勒菩薩上生兜率天経, Maitreyavyakaranas, 弥勒大成仏経 are in some cases called Miroku sanbukyo.
Additionally, in the Muryoju-kyo sutra of the Jodo sect, Shakamuni-butsu asked Miroku Bosatsu to preach the Hongwan (本願) of Amitabha Buddha against people in anguish of a later age.
Miroku Bosatsu appears as a future Buddha at the very early stage of Buddhism, and is described in the Agon-kyo sutra.
The concept of a future Buddha is thought to have developed from that of the "past seven Buddhas."
He was one of the founders of Yogacaravada, of India, who preached Vijnaptimatra around 300.
He was considered to be the same person as Miroku Bosatsu (mentioned above as a future Buddha) in a legend of a later age.
His works are "Yugashijiron," "Daijo-shougonkyoron," "中弁分別論,""現観荘厳論," "法法性弁別論," and so on.
In Tibet it is said that Yugashijiron is made by Muchaku Bosatsu and Kukyoichijohoshoron is made by Miroku Bosatsu, while it is regarded to be made by Kenne Bosatsu (堅慧) in a translation of Chinese.
Another thesis asserts that Miroku Bosatsu was created by incorporating the sun god ミスラ, who had been admired in Western Asia and believed in as Bosatsu, so that its character as the savior stemmed from this.
ミスラ has the same origin as Mitra, which is one of the gods of Aditya (アーディティヤ神群) in Indian mythology and was a god of contracts who was admired in the ancient Aryan civilization.
In Zoroastrianism it is one of the middle-class gods, Yazata, and it has an important role as a hero and sun god.
On the other hand, in ancient Greece and Rome it was called ミトラース and was admired as the sun god and a hero.
In Kusana, ミスラ was called Miiro, a name of Bactrian origin, and it is thought that this form of the word became the origin of Miroku.
Although Miiro's character as a god is not known other than as the sun god, Akira SADATAKA assumes that it had a character as a savoir, considering the influence of Manichaeism.
Miroku's Sanskrit name 'Maitreya' has the same origin as the name of ミスラ神.
Mitra/miθra' originally meant only 'contract' but later meant 'a sworn friend' with an intimate relationship by contract.
Maitreya means 'amicable, friendly and merciful (person)' in its derived adjective and noun.
Milk god
In Okinawa Miroku Bosatsu is called 'the milk god' or 'Milk-san,' and the belief in Miｒoku is popular.
In a festival, the milk god who wears a mask of milk walks around with a smile.
It is pointed out as being related to Hotei-son, which was considered to be an incarnation of Miroku Bosatsu.
While in India Miroku Bosatsu was shaped as a statue having suihei in his hand, in China it was shaped as a statue sitting cross-legged on a chair until the Tang and was shown as a corpulent figure of Hotei, an incarnation of Miroku after the Yuan and Ming dynasties.
On the other hand, during the Asuka period in Japan it was shaped as a hanka-shiyui image (半跏思惟像).
It is a figure meditating with the right foot on the left knee and the right hand softly on the cheek, being seated on a chair.
The gold-and-bronze statue of Yachu-ji Temple in Osaka (an important cultural property) is the oldest hanka-shiyui image having the inscription 'Miroku Bosatsu.'
The Miroku Bosatsu statue of Koryu-ji Temple in Kyoto (a wooden statue) is especially well known and is designated as a national treasure (see Bangasayusang).
However, a hanka-shiyui image is not always a statue of Miroku Bosatsu.
In the Heian and Kamakura periods, no hanka-shiyui image would be seen, but standing or seated images were produced.
The wooden statue of Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto, made by Kaikei, is a good example.
The statues of Miroku Nyorai, such as the wooden statue of Todai-ji Temple in Nara (known as the 'Great Buddha of Trial,' an important cultural property) mentioned above, and the statue of Taima-dera Temple Kondo (made during the Nara period and now a national treasure) and the wooden statue shaped by the Unkei group of Kofuku-ji Temple Hokuendo (a national treasure) are known.
Aum Maitreya svaahaa
The priest Hotei-son, who is known in Japan as one of the seven deities of good luck, is considered to be an incarnation of Miroku in China; he is enshrined and depicted as a relaxed figure with a smile and a fat stomach, as Miroku Nyorai appeared in this world at the front of the Buddhist hall.
The Nichiren chant is the words of Namu Myohorenge-kyo, which are recited in the Buddhist religious services held by religious organizations such as Nichiren and the Hoke-kyo Sutra sect.
It is also called Odaimoku.
Originally, it meant a title and five letters of Myohorenge-kyo (translated by Kumaraju), constituting the translated title (phonetic equivalent) of Hoke-kyo Sutra, and it is called the 'Nichiren chant' even when the two letters of Namu (meaning "of becoming a believer") are added.
Additionally, Odaimoku is sometimes used in the sense of public stance or in nominal terms.
They are diverted from the meaning mentioned above.
Both meanings are described below.
What is Nichiren chant?
Nichiren chant (title) of Hoke-kyo Sutra Part 1, Volume 8, Chapter 28, which Kumaraju translated into Chinese characters, consists of five letters, 'Myohorenge-kyo (妙法蓮華経).'
Namu Myohorenge-kyo' means to become a believer in the rule (Buddhism) and the teaching of Myohorenge-kyo (the Hoke-kyo sutra).
The training needed to recite Nichiren chant continuously is an ascetic training by which to declare one's belief in and willingness to follow the teaching of the Hoke-kyo sutra.
The continuous recitation of five or seven letters of Nichiren chant (which are translated into Chinese characters) is regarded as being the same pious act as reading and practicing all sutras.
Namu' is pronounced 'Namo,' 'Naamo' or 'Namasu' in Sanskrit.
Moreover, from the viewpoint of a person who tries to regard the Nichiren chant of five Chinese characters as Myogo (Amida's name) of the Original Buddha, the way of practice on teaching in five letters of the Nichiren chant is not Volume 8 Chapter 28 but instead the seven-letter Nichiren chant, which is, 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo (南無妙法蓮華経).'
The Tendai sect in the mid-Heian period came to recite the Nichiren chant already affected by the invocation of the Buddha's name, but it simply didn't incorporate Nichiren chant into dharma.
Nichiren in fact incorporated Nichiren chant into dharma for the first time.
Details of each sect
The ascetic training to recite 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' continuously is called 'Shodai (唱題（しょうだい）).'
The Hoke-kyo sects call this 'Shodaigyo (唱題行)' as 'Shogyo(正行（しょうぎょう）)' among various kinds of ascetic training and accord it the highest value.
Other types of ascetic training, such as standing under a waterfall, fasting or keeping silent are called 'Jogyo (助行（じょぎょう）)' and are regarded as auxiliary measures.
When believers of the Nichiren sect (mainly Icchi-ha sect) recite the Nichiren chant, they pronounce 'Namumyohorengekyo.'
Believers of the Fujimon-ryu sect (Nichiren Shoshu sect) and Soka Gakkai, which is a lay religion, pronounce 'Nanmyohorengekyo.'
Additionally, in the Buddhist religious services of Nichiren Shoshu sect there is a manner called 'Hiki-daimoku' other than Shodai, in which way each sound is recited longer as 'Na-mu-myo-ho-ren-ge-kyo.'
Although it is not seen now, a few years ago believers of Soka Gakkai recited by extending the sound of 'ren' as 'Na-mu-myo-ho-re-nge-kyo-na-mu-,' but Nikken Hoshu recites it as 'Ren-.'
Meanwhile, Nichinyo Hoshu has recited in the same way after 登座 (unknown at the time he was a chief priest).
Moreover, Buddhists respect the number three, such as three treasures, three studies and three secret processes so that the way of 'reciting the Nichiren chant three times' is used broadly at the beginning and end of Buddhist religious services or memorial ceremonies as a means of showing respect to the main image.
While believers of the Nichiren sect lineage recite each phrase in one breath, such as 'Namumyohorengekyo, Namumyohorengekyo, Namumyohorengekyo,' believers of many Fujimon-ryu sect lineages recite the first and second phrases continuously and recite the third phrase after taking in a breath, such as 'NamumyohorengekyoNamumyohorengekyo, Namumyohorengekyo.'
However, Fuji Taiseki-ji Kensho-kai is an exception among the Fujimon-ryu sect lineages; it adopts an original way of pronunciation as 'Nanmyo, Hoi-re-nge-kyo, Nanmyo, Hoi-re-nge-kyo, Nanmyo, Hoi-re-nge-kyo' and a manner such as 'making a bow twice while reciting 'Nanmyohorengekyo' twice in small voice, reciting the Nichiren chant three times, reciting the Nichiren chant three times again, and bowing twice in the same way as the first' (called 'greeting'), the origin of which is unknown.
The difference between the invocation of the Buddha's name and reciting the Nichiren chant
The invocation of the Buddha's name by the sects of the Pure Land faith is considered to mean that Amitabha Buddha comes forth from people's mouths in order to let people know they can go to paradise by Amida's true wish, and they place a high value on it as the thing that gives people peace of mind.
It is also regarded that living with that peace of mind is a true joy and relief, and that reciting 'Namu Amidabutsu' doesn't require pious acts but is instead a type of training to show gratitude.
Shakanyorai, 'Namu Syakamuni-butsu,' in 'Myogo (Amida's name),' which is recited in the invocation of the Buddha's name, is considered a real person in authentic history.
However, there is no other Nyorai in history.
For this reason there is a view that denies the existence of 'Amidabutsu' of 'Namu Amidabutsu' as a fictional, imaginary figure.
On the other hand, some people think that 'Amidabutsu' was preached by the historical Shaka as having no figure, being immeasurable and showing eternal 'truth,' so that Shaka's true intension is included in 'Amidabutsu.'
On the contrary, Shodai in the sects of the Hoke-kyo faith has an affirmative directivity (directivity for this world) to survive in this world, because they think this world is important.
(However, directivity for this world is not inherent with the Nichiren sects but is seen in the Shingon and Tendai sects.)
The Nichiren chant recited in Shodai is the title of a sutra, so that a subject of faith exists as a sutra.
Nichiren described that each letter of the sutra should be considered as a gold Syakuson.
Even if the letters of a sutra do not look like Nyorai as might be expected, they can at least be seen as letters.
Hoke-kyo (Myohorenge-kyo), when written in Chinese characters, can be seen as the enumeration of Chinese characters at least so that its existence as letters gives people peace of mind.
Even if the content of a sutra is fictional or a lie, it can be said that the letters of the sutra exist clearly and are the truth.
What is Odaimoku?
Odaimoku is sometimes used in the same sense of Nichiren chant mentioned above, but in other cases it is used without religious meaning.
Odaimoku, in that case, often means one's public stance or nominal terms and implies 'being different from the actual condition.'
For example, it is used such as 'to act seriously, not only with Odaimoku.'
Hokke-kyo (Hokke-kyo Sutra) is a collective term for the Mahayana Buddhism sutra, 'saddharmapundariika-suutra ('a white lotus flower as right teaching)' in Chinese translation.
When the character '経' is excluded, '法華' remains, which is generally pronounced 'Hokke.'
The meanings of 'saddharmapundariika-suutra' are as follows: sad means 'right,' 'strange' and 'good'; dharma means 'teaching' and 'truth'; pundarika means '因果倶時 and pure white lotus'; and suutra means 'a sutra that Buddha preached.'
It is said that there were 16 kinds of translations to Chinese for this sutra, but currently the following three translations remain complete: "the Lotus Sutra" (translated by Hogo JIKU, Zhu Fahua in the second century), ""(translated by Kumaraju in the fifth century), "添品妙法蓮華経"(translated by Jnana-gupta and Dharmagupta in the seventh century).
In the countries where Buddhism sutras were translated into Chinese, "Myohorenge-kyo" (translated by Kumaraju) was considered to be 'the best translation' and was used as the essential sutra for Tendai sects and many other sects, so that the name 'Hokke-kyo sutra' is in some cases used as an abbreviation for 'Myohorenge-kyo.'
Moreover, Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumonhon No. 25 of "Myohorenge-kyo," as translated by Kumaraju, has become widespread as the Kannon-gyo sutra.
Hokke-kyo sutra consists of 28 chapters.
According to Chigi's teachings (Tendai Daishi), which are widely used at present, the first 14 chapters are called Shakumon (the Trace Gate) and the last 14 chapters are called Honmon (the Source Gate).
Shakumon describes that Buddha appeared as a tentative figure in this world in order to teach people, and Honmon describes that Shakamuni did not become Buddha under the lime tree for the first time but had been Buddha since ancient times.
Shakumon was compared to the moon reflected on the water, and Honmon was compared to the moon shining in the sky.
Many sects depend on and use this theory, although there are some differences such as that the Tendai sect and Hokke sect Icchi-ha put the same high value on Shakumon and Honmon, while the Hokke sect Shoretsu-ha places a higher value on Honmon of Hokke-kyo in particular, regarding Honmon as the superior part and Syakumon as the inferior part.
Additionally, from the point of Sanbun, Hokke-kyo can be divided into three parts (one sutra of three parts) such as Jobun (Johon), Shojubun (from Hobenbon to the first part of Funbetsuhon) and Ruzubun (from Funbetsuhon to Kanbotsuhon).
And if it is subdivided (two sutras of six parts), each Shakumon and Honmon is divided into Jobun, Shojubun and Ruzubun.
The first part is called Shakumon and states that Nijo can become Buddha (二乗作仏) over Mahayana Buddhism, as taught by the Hannya-kyo sutra.
Nijo is a person with higher income and good deeds from the living things, and there is a description that a wealthy Bosatsu worshiped Buddha with followers, so that various kinds of people served to embellish Hokke-kyo majestically around Buddha.
Additionally, it showed the teaching of egalitarianism as 'all people can be Buddhas some day' from the values of that time, like 未来成仏(悪人成仏) of Daidatta, and emphasized this through representations such as the appearance of a treasure tower in which Tahonyorai appeared and clarified the correctness of Hokke-kyo, 虚空会 and 二仏並座.
There is a viewpoint of 'passion play,' which forecasts that the priests who believe this teaching and are in charge of missionary works are inevitably oppressed by the public, which are common in Semitic monotheistic religions such as Judaism and Christianity.
The last part is called Honmon, which is described in Kuonjitsujo (久遠実成).
It mainly states that Shakamunibutsu was not awakened in this world for the first time but had already become Buddha in an immeasurable past time.
This led to a dispute on Honbutsuron (本仏論.)
From the viewpoint of Honmon, Buddha is not simply an individual, historical shaka.
Once a life begins to learn the Hokke-kyo sutra, it enters the path of belief despite the difficulties and will open its immeasurable ability.
It describes that the way of life itself is called Buddha.
Therefore, the length of life is understood to last forever in an immeasurable future over the superficial life and death.
Therefore, this corrupt world is a place in which Buddha, who has eternal life, always exists and guides people to relief forever.
It describes that the teaching that 'all people can inevitably become Buddhas someday' is not only a logic or an ideal but a fact with a definite promise.
Additionally, it describes that the one who hears this dharma (such as Buddha) is an existence having eternal life but can attain large good deeds only by believing it joyfully (一念信解・初随喜).
The subjects of dharma range from Bosatsu to others in all kinds of settings.
As a dharma (Buddhism) to guide stupid people during the Age of the Final Dharma, it describes 末法弘教の付嘱 against Jiyu Bosatsus such as Jogyo Bosatsu and the protection of believers of the Hokke-kyo sutra and practical benefit in this world by the force of Kanzeon Bosatsu, etc.

Seven parables are described in the Hokke-kyo sutra.
This is based on an episode in which Shakabutsu preached to people using parables, and each chapter of the Hokke-kyo sutra adopts this style in order to be easily understood.
This is also called Hokke Shichiyu or Shichihi.
The parable of the three carts and the burning house (Hiyuhon)
The parable of the wealthy man and the poor son (Shingehon)
The parable of the medicinal herbs (Yakusoyuhon)
The parable of the gem and the magic city (Kejoyuhon)
The parable of the gem in the jacket (Gohyakudeshijukihon)
The parable of a brilliant gem in a king's top-knot (Anrakugyohon)
The parable of the excellent physician (Nyoraijuryohon)
The Hokke-kyo sutra is considered to have been established more than 500 years after Shakuson's demise, and it is generally estimated as dating from 50 B.C. to 150 B.C. in the present study of Buddhism.
Therefore, the Hokke-kyo sutra isn't a direct teaching of the historical Gotama Siddhartha (Shaka) as well as other Mahayana sutras, but instead it describes that '外道の論議を説くと謂わん' as mentioned above, that is, in the Age of Final Dharma, more people could not believe the Hokke-kyo sutra and criticize it as a heresy (an idea that was not preached by Buddha, 非仏説).
Additionally, there is a theory that this sutra suggested the social situation faced by the religious organizations that edited this sutra.
Moreover, since many episodes such as Hokke Shichiyu (above) are included in the Hokke-kyo sutras, another theory guesses that it was made by a religious organization that had many believers.
The philosopher Hajime NAKAMURA guesses that the oldest limit of age when Hokke-kyo sutra was written must be 40 B.C., judging by the situation of a dying wealthy man who took an interest in finance, as described in the parable of the wealthy man and the poor son; because there could not be such a wealthy man who was not only a wealthy man but also a capitalist and was scared by kings and utilized them, unless it was in the age when money economy became much more developed.
Additionally, Shoko WATANABE pointed out that it could have been produced in a society that had less influence by Brahmanic culture, judging from the parable that someone who was a garbage man for 20 years was, after 50 years in exile, told that he was the successor of a wealthy man; because there was a strong caste system centered in Brahmin of Indian society since ancient times, so that this parable wasn't realistic.
This sutra had been disseminated widely in the eastern part of Eurasia before it was conveyed to Japan.
There are many editions in Sanskrit, partly because it was widely disseminated in India.
In the translation by Kumaraju, it omits mantra (Shingon) and in (印).
These are added in 添品法華経.
It was also translated into Tibetan, Uighur, Tangut, Mongolian, Manchurian, Korean (onmun) and so on.
These translations show that this sutra had been extensively read and recited.
The Chinese Tendai sect regarded the Hokke-kyo sutra as the most important sutra.
Chigi (Tendai Daishi) of Tendai-san Kokusei-ji Temple in Zhejiang, China, depended on the sutra "Myohorenge-kyo" written by Kumaraju.
Because there is a piece of plate on which the Hokke-kyo sutra is written at Shosoin in Japan, it seems that the Hokke-kyo sutra has been popular since ancient times.
There is a description in Nihon Shoki that Prince Shotoku had a lecture on Hokke-kyo sutra in the year 606.
The Crown Prince had a lecture on Hokke-kyo sutra at Okamoto Palace.
The Emperor was very pleased and gave him about 100 hectares of rice fields in Harima Province.
Therefore, the Crown Prince paid it to Ikarugadera Temple.'
(Vol. 22, Empress Suiko No. 14)
In 615 Prince Shotoku described "Hokke Gisho," a commentary of the Hokke-kyo sutra (see 'Sangyogisho').
Since the time of Prince Shotoku, Hokke-kyo has generally been regarded as a sutra that is linked by fate to Japan from the standpoint of being the guard of the nation as well as one of the most important sutras of Buddhism.
The Tendai sect, which was introduced to Japan by Saicho, was greatly admired by the Imperial Court until the Meiji Restoration.
Empress Komyo, who was the empress of Emperor Shomu, built 'a temple that can cancel crimes (法華滅罪之寺（ほっけめつざいのてら）),' calling it a 'provincial nunnery' and believed in the Hokke-kyo sutra.
Saicho, of the Tendai sect, named his sect the 'Tendai Hokke sect' and regarded the Hokke-kyo sutra as the supreme dharma.
The Hokke-kyo sutra played an important role in the new Buddhism of Kamakura.
Ryonin, a founder of the Yuzu nenbutsu sect, which recites Yuzu Nenbustu (融通念仏), insisted on the invocation of the Buddha's name as a pioneer of the later Buddhism of Jodo-sect lineage, and regarded the Kegon-kyo and Hokke-kyo sutras as major sutras (正依) but considered the Three Sutras of the Pure Land, the Jodosanbu-kyo sutra, to be minor sutras (傍依).
On the other hand, Honen, a founder of the Jodo sect, as well as Shinran, a founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, and others regarded the Three Sutras of the Pure Land as major sutras because they thought that the relief of an ignorant, deluded person was written in it, but nothing critical of the Hokke-kyo sutra has been seen.
It could be said that Kuonjitsujo of Amitabha Buddha was influenced by the Hokke-kyo sutra.
Dogen, a founder of the Soto sect, insisted on mediation of '只管打坐' as a way to implement enlightenment but continuously tried to find theoretical evidence in the Hokke-kyo sutra.
The sutra he read in dying was Nyoraijinrikihon of Hokke-kyo Sutra.
Nichiren's appearance made a theoretical lineage to try to establish the status of the Hokke-kyo sutra as 'the supreme sutra of Buddhism' and 'the right dharma (正法) (妙法)' appear more radical.
Nichiren recited the Nichiren chant of 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' (唱題行) and became a founder of the Hokke sects by teaching that an ignorant, deluded person could have the ability to become a Buddha through belief in Myohorenge-kyo and could trace the path to true enlightenment.
By this teaching, a belief in the Hokke-kyo sutra spread among people throughout Japan.
The Hokke sect of Nichiren studies (日蓮教学) placed high value on the five letters of 'Myohorenge-kyo (妙法蓮華経)' in this sutra's title (a formal title of the sutra translated by Kumaraju in Chinese) and considered the recitation of Namu myohorenge-kyo (a chant of five letters or seven letters) as 正行.
During modern times the Hokke-kyo sutra also influenced many writers and thinkers, mainly through Nichiren.
It could be said that the common point among modern famous Hokke-kyo sutra believers' lives without regard to leftism or rightism was their unyielding rejection of petit bourgeois glory and the effort to obey only their ideal.
It is said that Kenji MIYAZAWA (a poet and author of children's stories), Chogyu TAKAYAMA (a thinker), Giro SENO (a religious thinker), Ikki KITA (a rightist revolutionary) and Kanji ISHIWARA (a warrior and staff person in the Kwantung army) were well-known examples.
After the defeat in World War II in 1945, some sects that believed the Hokke-kyo sutra were forced to change their interpretation on dharma, such as a description on the ability of women to become Buddhas in accordance with the intension of the Occupation Army.
Some sects that place high value on the Hokke-kyo sutra as the essential sutra adopt Chigi's teaching that the Hokke-kyo is the secret of Shaka's dharma, 正法（妙法）, which was said to be preached by Shaka in his later years.
On the other hand, in the philology there is a theory that the Hokke-kyo sutra was written by a religious organization that was opposed to the monopoly by full-time priests of Hinayana around the beginning of the A.D. epoch or the end of the B.C. epoch.
Considering the results of philology whereby the Hokke-kyo sutra was edited a few centuries later than the age in which Shaka lived, the ways of thinking between Japan and other Mahayana Buddhism countries are different.
According to the traditional Japanese religious sects, Mahayana sutras such as Hannya-kyo, the Nirvana sutra and the Hokke-kyo, which was considered to have been written in a later age by other sects, are not rootless because it's possible for disciples of existent religious organizations to succeed and develop their master's dharma.
They tend to insist on such eclectic theories that later sutras can be admitted as 'Shaka's dharma' because they have developed in the process of inheriting Shaka's teaching orally, from disciple to disciple.
There is, however, a theory that the religious organizations and believers of other Mahayana Buddhist countries such as the Eurasian states of China, Nepal, Tibet, Butan, Mongolia, Buryat, Tuva, Kalmyks and Taiwan do not accept this result of philology, which doesn't represent a major problem, but the reason for that theory isn't known.
The Buddhist invocation is generally to recite 'Namu Amidabutsu' as a devotional exercise in the Jodo-kyo sects of Pure Land teachings.
It can be roughly divided into three in the history of Buddhist doctrine.
In early Buddhism, a tenacious belief in Buddha (憶念) was called Buddhist invocation.
修定 of Buddhism is basically understood as stopping all conscious activity.
隨念 is a way to stop all other conscious activity by concentrating on a specific subject when it is difficult to stop conscious activity.
見仏' which makes Buddha Body (仏身) (色身) a subject of tenacious belief, 'meditation' and '観仏', which are observation in jhana samadhi (禅定三昧), became to be included in Buddhist invocation.
With the emergence of Mahayana Buddhism, it was regarded as an important ascetic training (Buddhism) to admire the virtue of Buddhas and hold a mass.
Therefore, Buddhist invocation in samadhi was regarded as that training.
The Tendai sect performs Jogyo-zanmai as ascetic training at Jogyo-do (Jogyo-zanmai-do, Hanshu-zanmai-do)of Mt. Hiei-zan.
In the practice of Jodo-kyo in China, there are two streams of Buddhist invocation.
Kanso Nenbutsu (観相念仏)' (to ponder the figure of Buddha)
Byakuren-sha of Eon, Zenkan Nenbutsu (禅観念仏) of Jimin, etc.
The Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra (meditation sutra), in which Kanso Nenbutsu is described, are not seen in the books translated into Sanskrit or Tibetan, and there are theses that it was edited in China or Central Asia, so that Kanso Nenbutsu was a mainstream at the early stage of Jodo-kyo in China.
In Japan, Kanso Nenbutsu was mainstream in Nara Buddhism (the Hosso sect) and Heian Buddhism (the Tendai sect).
In Ojoyoshu, written by Genshin (a priest), Kanso Nenbutsu was accorded high value and was therefore popular among aristocrats during the Heian period.
Given that influence, the style of architecture and art by which to show the Pure Land and Amida-triad (such as Byodoin Temple in Uji and Chuson-ji Temple in Hiraizumi) developed during the Heian period.
While Jokei recommended Kanso Nenbutsu of Shaka, he criticized Senshu Nenbutsu (専修念仏) of Honen.
Invocation of the Buddha's name (a so-called Buddhist invocation)
Particularly, Zendo insisted that a tenacious belief in Buddha and the invocation of the Buddha's name were the same, and recommended the invocation of the Buddha's name.
It did not need to mediate Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land in particular, so architected spaces (temples and halls) and religious arts (statues and pictures of Buddha) were not necessary either.
Therefore, since anyone could recite Buddha's name without regard to time or space, it contributed to the prevalence of Buddhist invocation among people from various walks of life.
The stream of invocation of the Buddha's name was taken over by Ryonin, a founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, at the end of the Heian period in Japan, and the invocation by the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect recited 'Namu Amidabutsu' and was later called Dai Nenbutsu (大念仏).
In the Jodo sect, which was founded by Honen, Senju-nenbutsu (meaning the single-minded recitation of 'Namu Amidabutsu') has been incorporated and taken over by the Jodo Shinshu sect founded by Shinran, from the same lineage.
Odori Nenbutsu is to recite Buddhist invocation and songs, dancing while beating a drum or ringing a bell.
It is said to originate from Kuya.
In the Kamakura period, when Ippen of the Jishu sect visited Tomono of Shinano Province (Saku City, Nagano Prefecture), he performed Odori Nenbutsu after the example of Kuya.
At about the same time, Shunjo IKKO, a priest of the Jodo sect in Kyusyu, performed Odori Nenbutsu independently of Ippen.
After these events, priests of the Jishu and Ikko-shu sects (meaning the lineage of Shunjo IKKO as opposed to the Jodo Shinshu sect, later the Jishu Ikko-ha sect) came to perform it in missionary work, whereby it spread throughout the country.
It had a significant influence on Bon Odori dance, Nenbutsu folk dances and the kabuki Odori dance, as begun by IZUMO no Okuni.
Tendai Sect is a sect of Mahayana (greater vehicle) Buddhism.
Its fundamental sutra is Lotus Sutra.
It originated in China and was introduced into Japan by Saicho in the early Heian period.
Chinese Tendai Sect is a sect of Mahayana Buddhism, and its eventual founder was Chigi (538 - 597, Tendai Chisha Daishi) who was active in the Sui period.
Its first and second founder was Emon of Hokusei and Kozan Eshi (515 - 577) respectively and Chigi was Eshi's disciple (it is also said that the 1st founder was Ryuju, the 2nd was Emon, the 3rd was Eshi and the 4th was Chigi)
Chigi was a scholar priest who originated a doctrine based on Hokke-kyo sutra, Makahannya haramikyo sutra and Daichidoron (Commentary on the Great Wisdom Sutra) that were translated by Kumaraju as well as Nehangyo sutra, advocated Kyoso hanjaku (theory on the history of sutra establishment) based on Goji hakkyo, which deems Hoke-kyo sutra as paramount, and preached to become Buddha through shikan (Tendai Meditation).
However, there are views asserting 'Hoke-kyo sutra translated by Kumaraju is substantially different from the existent Sanskrit version and in particular, Hobenbon daini, which Tendai Sect emphasizes might have been modified based on Kumaraju's own doctrine.'
In view of the fact that Kumaraju attached importance to Hoke-kyo sutra, Makahannya haramikyo sutra and Daichidoron, it can be said that the foundation of the Tendai Sect was triggered by Kumaraju.
After its basis was established at Mt. Tendai, it absorbed the Nehan Sect and the Tendai Sect was finally established.
Chigi's Hokke gengi (Essentials of the Lotus Sutra), Hokke mongu (Commentary on the Lotus Sutra) and Makashikan (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation) are collectively called Sandaibu (the three important scriptures) and are deemed as the essence of Tendai Sect Buddhism.
Shoan Kanjo (561 - 632), 4th founder, recorded and compiled these writings by Chigi.
After Kanjo, the sect was succeeded by Chii (? - 680), Kanjo's disciple, followed by Ei (634 - 713), Chii's disciple, and Sakei Genro(673 - 754).
As the influence of Tendai Sect declined after Kansho, Sakei Genro is assumed as the 5th founder.
Keikei Tannen, 6th founder, who was a disciple of Genro and is deemed as the beginner of the restoration of Tendai Sect, wrote many books concerning the doctrine of the Tendai Sect, including Sandaibu.
Its official name is the Tendai Hokke En Sect.
Sometimes it is called the Hokke En Sect, Tendai Hokke Sect or simply Hokke Sect.
However, the last one is seldom used because it could be confused with Hokke Sect of Nichiren kyogaku (religious doctrine advocated by Nichiren).
The writings related to the Tendai Sect were initially brought into Japan by Ganjin Wajo, who was a priest of the Ritsu Sect as well as the Tendai Sect.
Then, Denkyo daishi Saicho (767 - 822) traveled to Tang (805), visited Mt. Tendai, learned the doctrine of the Tendai Sect, returned to Japan (806) and founded the Japanese Tendai Sect.
At that time, Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara), such as the Hosso Sect and the Kegon Sect, had already been introduced into Japan, but in China, they were the sects that were founded later than Tendai Sect.
After returning to Japan, Saicho came back to Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei and since then, he nurtured many Buddhist monks including Ennin and Enchin.
As Saicho advocated the doctrine of Hokke ichijo which asserted all people were able to become Buddha, disputes arose between Nara Buddhism (Nanto rokushu) which stuck to the position of Theravada Buddhism.
In particular, the debate conducted between the Tokuitsu of the Hosso Sect is well-known.
His innovative initiatives to establish Daijo kaidan, recognize monks who received Daijokai (the commandment of Mahayana Buddhism) as Tendai Sect monks and train them as Bosatsuso (priests of Mahayana Buddhism) by containing them in Mt. Hiei for 12 years deepened the confrontation between Nara Buddhism, which monopolized, due to vested interests, and Kaidan-in which were authorized to grant Shojokai (commandments of Theravada Buddhism) brought by Ganjin Wajo.
As Daijokai was deemed at that time as commandments for secular people, not for Buddhist monks (even at present, Daijokai is not recognized as Buddhist precepts under Theravada Buddhism, such as Sri Lanka Theravada Buddhism), the refutation by Nanto (Nara) priests might be reasonable in light of the common sense that then prevailed.
As a result of disputes, imperial sanction concerning Daijo kaidan was given after Saicho's death and the Tendai Sect was formally established, both in name and substance, as an independent religious sect.
While Mikkyo of the Shingon Sect is called Tomitsu, that of the Tendai sect is called Taimitsu.
Religious sects that deem Nichiren to be the real Buddha in the Mappo era criticize the current Japanese Tendai Sect asserting that it is close to the Shingon Sect because it has substantially incorporated the elements of Esoteric Buddhism and the teaching of Mt. Hiei was distorted by Ennin and Enchin because they incorporated Shingon Esoteric Buddhism after Saicho's death and against his will.
In considering the above, however, several points, including historical situation, should be taken into account.
When Tendai daishi Chigi, who is said to be the founder of Tendai Sect in China, advocated Kyoso hanjaku (also called Kyohan for short) based on Goji hakkyo, in which he systemized Buddhism as a whole according to the doctrine of Hokke-kyo sutra, Esoteric Buddhism had not yet been introduced and therefore, it was not included in Kyohan.
However, Esoteric Buddhism, the latest Buddhism at the time, had already been introduced when Denkyo daishi Saicho, the founder of the Japanese Tendai sect, traveled to Tang.
As Saicho worried that Japanese Esoteric Buddhism was imperfect, he received Kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) of Esoteric Buddhism from Jungyo and returned to Japan with the intention of systemizing Buddhism as a whole, including Esoteric Buddhism.
When Kukai returned from Tang one year later after Saicho had returned, Saicho recognized that the Esoteric Buddhism he had learned in Tang from Jungyo was collateral and asked Kukai with the utmost courtesy to take him in as a disciple in order to study Esoteric Buddhism, but he eventually parted from Kukai due to their differences in views on Buddhism.
Due to the above, incorporation of perfect Esoteric Buddhism into Tendai kyogaku was stopped.
However, there is no doubt about the fact that Saicho intended to establish the doctrine of comprehensive Buddhism by integrating Buddhist precepts based on Hokke-kyo sutra, Zen, Nenbutsu (Buddhist prayer) and Esoteric Buddhism and his disciples, including Ennin and Enchin, succeeded Saicho's will, restudied Esoteric Buddhism and completed Tendai kyogaku which had been the earnest desire of Saicho.
Therefore, it can be said that the origin of the current Tendai Esoteric Buddhism is not Ennin and Enchin but Saicho himself.
Further, as Enchin pointed out 5 defects in Kukai's 'Jujushinron' (Ten Stages of Mind Development) and refuted it as 'there is no superiority or inferiority between Tendai and Shingon,' the views held by sects which deem Nichiren to be the real Buddha that Ennin and Enchin distorted Tendai by incorporating Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, is completely denied by the above fact.
The difference between Shingon Esoteric Buddhism (Tomitsu) and Tendai Esoteric Buddhism (Taimitsu) is that while Tomitsu advocates its doctrine with Dainichi nyorai being its principal image, Taimitsu takes the stance of Hokke ichijo with Shakamunibutsu of Kuon-jitsujo (eternal life of the Buddha), which is the principal image of Hokke-kyo sutra, being its principal image.
In view of the above-mentioned, it is pointed out that the Japanese Tendai Sect founded by Saicho is, in spite of the same name, a different one from the Chinese Tendai Sect which is based on Hokke-kyo sutra and founded by Chigi, and although it succeeds Chigi's doctrine and is based on Hokke-kyo sutra, it is a unique one that tried to fuse the elements of Zen, Buddhist precepts, nenbutsu and Esoteric Buddhism or the one that tried to develop Chigi's Tendai kyogaku while succeeding it.
Therefore, Enryaku-ji Temple is also called dojo (a hall used for training) for Shishu kengaku.
Ascetic training of the Tendai Sect emphasizes 'Shikan,' which is based on Hokke-kyo sutra and could be said to be Hokke Zen.
Ascetic training of the current Japanese Tendai Sect can be summarized in the words of "asa daimoku, yu nenbutsu" (read the Lotus Sutra in the morning and pray to Amida Buddha in the evening).
In the morning, Buddhist monks practice daimoku, namely gyoho of chanting Hokke-kyo sutra (it is called hokke senbo) and in the evening, they practice gyoho of praying to a principal image Amida Buddha (it is called reiji saho).
Shikangyo developed further in later years and became the first step of the development of new Buddhism called 'nenbutsu.'
The sect strengthened its basis by conducting incantation of Tendai Esoteric Buddhism (Taimitsu) and becoming comprehensive Buddhism (there is doubt and criticism concerning the reason why the sect needed to conduct nenbutsu and/or incantation if it believed the doctrine of Hokke-kyo sutra was right).
Furthermore, in later years, the sect established the Tendai hongaku philosophy, which asserts that Buddhist nature dwells in all beings.
As the sect played a leading role in the education of Buddhism in Japan, many scholar monks who advocated new religious sect doctrines, such as the Yuzu Nenbutsu Sect, the Jodo Sect, the Jodo-Shin Sect, the Rinzai Sect, the Soto Sect and the Nichiren Sect, were turned out from the sect from the end of Heian period to Kamakura period.
Bosatsu, or Bodhisattva (in Sanskrit) is a disciplinant who wants to become Buddha (tries to become Nyorai) in Buddhism.
Later Bosatsu, in spite of a disciplinant, became a target of people's belief because it was considered to live with people and lead people to Buddha's teaching.
Summary
It came from the phrase "bodhi-sattva" in Sanskrit.
Bodhi means 'awake,' and sattva means 'a living person' so that it was freely translated into 'the living things' or 'humanity.'
For this reason he is referred to in the two senses of 'a person who pursues enlightenment' and 'a person who has awakened' so that there are two kinds of Bosatsu in India, while in China 'an Indian Mahayana Buddhism monk' is also called Bosatsu.
As a result, there are three kinds of Bosatsu.
However, merely seeking enlightenment leads to the same as Shomon, Engaku and Bykakushibutsu, so that in order to avoid this, the Hannya-kyo sutra, a Mahayana sutra of the early stage, added Bodhisattva Mahasattva (菩薩摩訶薩) and Mahasattva (摩訶薩) (the great living thing) and differentiated Mahayana Bosatsu.
Additionally, in the Hannyashin-kyo sutra translated by Genjo there is a word, '菩提薩埵' in the latter part, which is said that it was intentionally divided into '菩提' and '薩埵' according to nirukti.
In the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra, Daihannyaharamitta-kyo Sutra translated by Genjo, it was described as Bodhisattva Mahasattva (菩薩摩訶薩).
After the idea of Bosatsu was established, the rank of Bosatsu was produced next.
This had been segmented and structured in accordance with the development of Mahayana Buddhism, but various theories emerged according to the interpretation of sutra.
In "Kegon-kyo Sutra" and "Sutra of the Fundamental Vows of the Jeweled Bodhisattva," the status or grades of training were divided into 52 ranks, ranging from Myokaku, Tokaku, Jicchi (Ten Stages), Jueko (Ten Transferences), Jugyo (Ten Behavioral Activities), Juju (Ten Dwelling), Jushin (Ten Faith), and from this 52 ranks have often been adopted.
Myokaku
The last position of the 52 ranks for Bosatsu training, Bosatsu in Tokaku rank, gets this rank by overcoming Mumyo, abidya, of Ippon.
It is also a rank with overcoming Bonno (earthly desires), and is seen as being the same as Buddha and Nyorai.
Tokaku
It is the fifty-first rank and one of the highest of the 52 ranks for Bosatsu training, and it means that its wisdom and virtue become equal to those of Myokaku, a Buddha of 略万徳円満.
Jicchi, Juchi, Ten Stages
From the forty-first through fiftieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks from the highest are as follows: dharma-cloud, the finest wisdom, unperturbed state, afar practice, open mind, mastery of utmost difficulty, glowing wisdom, illumination, purity, and joy from the upper rank.
It was named '地', 'a land' because it can be compared to a land putting on all things and giving benefit to them that Bosatsu gets the wisdom of Buddha, keeps holding without moving, bears the burden of all living things, teaches them and gives them benefit.
Jueko, Ten Transferences
From the thirty-first through fortieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks from the highest are as follows: Transference of equalizing the boundless dharma realm; Transference of the liberation without any tie nor attachment; Transference of the mark of true suchness; Transference of viewing all sentient beings in equality and harmony; Transference of the good roots of equality and harmony; Transference of the store of boundless virtues; Transference of reaching everywhere; Transference of equalizing all Buddhas; Transference of non-destruction; and Transference of salvaging all sentient beings but detaching from any form of sentient being.
They are the ranks in which a disciplinant does (廻施) all selfish and altruistic training that it had already done for the living things and tries to reach an enlightenment (仏果) by putting this good deed after Jugyo.
Jugyo, Ten Behavioral Activities
From the twenty-first through thirtieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks, from the highest, are as follows: manifesting in all things the pure, final and true reality; perfecting Buddha's law by complete virtues; exalting the paramitas among all beings; unimpeded; appearing in any form at will; never out of order; without limit; never resenting; beneficial service; and joyful service.
This is the rank where Bosatsu tries to relieve the living things in order to complete more altruistic training after getting a certification (印可) as a Buddhist (仏子) at the end of Juju.
Dana - Generosity, charity, giving of oneself; Sila - Morality, purity of conduct; Ksanti - Endurance, forbearance, patience; Virya - Diligence, zeal; Dhyana - Meditation, mental concentration; Upaya - The ways and means of emptiness and detachment; Pranidhana - Spiritual vows; Bala - Spiritual Powers; Jnana - Spiritual wisdom
Juju, Ten Dwellings
From the eleventh through twentieth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks from the highest are as follows: Kanjo, Abhiseka; Being the prince of the law; Being Buddha's son; Non-retrogression; The whole mind as Buddha's; Perfect expedience; Acquiring the seed of Tathagata; Unobstructed cultivation; Clear understanding and mental control; Setting objectives.
It is called '住' in the sense that the mind of the disciplinant lives in Shintai, the real truth after Jushin.
Another theory asserts that Jicchi of Bosatsu should be called Juju.
Jushin, Ten Faiths
From the first through tenth in the 52 ranks of Bosatsu training
The 10 ranks, from the highest, are as follows: Vow, Precept, Reflexive power, Non-retrogression, Concentration, Wisdom, Zeal, Remembrance, and Faith.
This is the rank where a disciplinant has no doubt regarding the belief in Buddha's dharma.
Additionally, Jushin names generically the gebon, (i.e., outer stages) the ranks from Juju to Jueko (called naibon, i.e., inner stages or the three virtuous positions) and the ranks from Jushin to Jueko (called 凡).
Juchi and Tokaku names 因, Myokaku names 果, and the ranks from Juchi to Myokaku name 聖, which are in opposition to 凡
Suppositional idea
Although there could be various reasons behind the development of the Mahayana Buddhism movement, it can be thought to be a movement that emerged due to the fact that any Hinayana priest who performed the ascetic practices of Shomon could not become Buddha.
It was thought that there were two reasons for that, and the disciplinants who could not become Buddha were called as follows:
Shomon, who was awakened by Buddha's teaching
Engaku or Byakushibutsu, who did not preach in spite of reaching enlightenment by itself
Early in Mahayana Buddhism, these were called two vehicles and were regarded as being unable to become Buddha.
Bosatsu as a disciplinant
From the early stage of Buddhism, Buddha in the disciplinant age before enlightenment was called Bosatsu.
In Jataka, Shaka's previous life story, a figure of Shaka's previous life was also called Bosatsu.
What was created as a representative of this Bosatsu was Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva), who was said to become Buddha next.
Miroku Bosatsu is considered to appear in this world as 弥勒仏 after ascetic training for 5670 million years.
Amitabha Buddha, which later became Amitabha Buddha, is a representative example.
Bosatsu for working in this world
Despite having reached enlightenment already, Bosatsu, who was prohibited from becoming Buddha, was created.
This is because it was thought that the activity of Buddha itself had a restriction, so that a person who worked for Buddha hand and foot, as it were, was called Bosatsu.
Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu, of the Amida triad, are examples of this.
They are not only symbols of Shaka's functions but also work as functions themselves.
Additionally, Kanzeon Bosatsu and Seishi Bosatsu are Bosatsu who work without regard to becoming Buddhas.
Mahayana priest in India
In China, since the details of the Indian situation were not heard, the priests of the early Mahayana Buddhism were given honorific titles, of Bosatsu in particular.
Ryuju Bosatsu, Seshin Bosatsu and others were examples in this case.
Miroku Bosatsu needs attention.
There were Miroku Bosatsu created as Bosatsu in Isshohusho (一生補処, the rank where a disciplinant could become Buddha by one more reincarnation) and Miroku who were told to edit Yugashijiron (there is another opinion that another person edited it but that Miroku was asked to pretend to be an editor (仮託説)).
Bosatsu in Japan
In Japan it was a subject of faith.
The following major Bosatsu were greatly admired: Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu, who is depicted as a mother; Miroku Bosatsu who relieves people in the far future; Fugen Bosatsu, who appears in the Hokke-kyo sutra, which says women can become Buddhas and has been deeply admired by women; Monju Bosatsu, who controls the wisdom; and Zijo Bosatsu, who is at the roadsides and nearest to the grass roots.
Syncretization of Shinto with Buddhism
As a stage of syncretization of Shinto with Buddhism there came the idea that the god of Japan hoped to escape from crime and achieve enlightenment as well as human beings.
Based on that idea, Bosatsu-go (菩薩号) was used as a name of the god of Japan who came to believe in Buddhism.
The Hachiman deity is representative of that.
Titles of high priests
In some cases the Imperial Court gave high priests the Bosatsu title.
Gyoki Bosatsu is an example in this case.
This article describes the history of Hongwan-ji Temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect, founded by Shinran.
On November 28, 1262 (old lunar calendar), Shinran, a founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, fell ill at Zenpo-bo of Sanjo Tominokoji and entered nirvana at the age of 90.
His funeral was held at 8 p.m. on the next day, the 29th.
Kenchi of Takada Shimotsuke Province, Senshin of Ikeda Totomi Province and others came up to Kyoto and participated in the funeral.
His body was cremated at Ennin-ji Temple, located in the south of Higashiyama Toribeno.
On the 30th his born was collected.
His grave was built at Otani, located in the north of Toribeno, and his born was placed in the grave.
In 1272, the Otani Mausoleum was built in what is now the Rinka-cho, Higashiyama Ward (around Sotaiin, the north of Chion-in Temple's gate), the living place of Kakushinni, Shinran's youngest daughter, and Shinran's portrait was placed there.
It is thought that the temple where Shinran's portrait was placed should be called Hongwan-ji Temple, after a transfer of the temple.
Kakusinni was in charge of Rusushiki, who preserved it.
After that, her descendants were deemed to be successors, which later became a basis of inheritance by Kechimiyaku (血脈), a bloodline or lineage of succession, of Hongwan-ji Temple.
Rusushiki was succeeded by Kakushinni and then to Kakue and Kakunyo.
Emperor Kameyama (who reigned from 1259 to 1274) gave the title of "Kuon Jitsujo Amida Hongwan-ji Temple," but the mausoleum was ultimately destroyed because of infighting.
In 1312 the third Rusushiki Kakunyo rebuilt Mausoleum as a temple, Senju-ji Temple.
(Moreover, there is no direct relationship to Takada Honzan Senju-ji Temple of the same Jodo Shinsu sect.)
However, it changed the name to Hongwan-ji (Otani Hongwan-ji Temple) in accordance with the protest of the Mt. Hiei-zan priests.
Kakunyo tried to integrate all disciples of Shinran under Hongwan-ji Temple.
He wrote "Kuden-sho" and described that the teachings of the Jodo Shinshu sect were transferred by word of mouth from Honen to Shinran, from Shinran to his grandson Nyoshin, and from Nyoshin to Kakunyo.
This showed that Kakunyo, a chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple, succeeded Shinran in the point of dharma as well.
However, in reality it was difficult to establish an independent religious organization in Kyoto as opposed to established temples such as Enryaku-ji Temple, which acquired economic power over the years and in some cases had military forces.
Before the Showa era it was oppressed in 1330, 1352 and 1388, and while other schools of Jodo Shinshu sect spread in eastern Japan and elsewhere, only Hongwan-ji Temple declined and was permitted existence on the condition of loyalty to Enryaku-ji Temple and the forbiddance of Buddhism invocation as a subtemple of Shorenin, which was influenced by Enyryaku-ji Temple.
At that time, the Jodo Shinshu sect was not integrated into the Hongwan-ji Temple group.
Other groups were scattered throughout Japan.
The Takada, a lay follower group (門徒) (based in Senshu-ji Temple), the Araki group and the Wada group were lineages of Shinbutsu and Kenchi.
The Kashima lay follower group, the Date group and the Yokosone group were influential as well.
Particularly, the Takada lay follower group flourished.
Also, Ryogen's group developed by using '名帳' and '絵系図' based in Bukko-ji Temple of Kyoto.
The chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple was succeeded by Zennyo, Shakunyo, Konnyo, and Zonnyo after Kakunyo.
During this period, Hongwan-ji Temple gradually became influential, centered in Omi Province and the Hokuriku district.
In 1390, Shakunyo, the fifth chief priest, built Zuisen-ji Temple (Nanto City) in Inami, Ecchu Province (Toyama Prefecture).
Konyo, the sixth chief priest, was also engaged in missionary work at Hokuriku, centered on Zuisen-ji Temple.
In the succeeding era of Zonnyo, it became more influential and Hongwan-ji groups were established in Omi Province (Shiga Prefecture), Kaga Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), Noto Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture), etc.
In Hongwan-ji Temple, 御影堂 and Amida-do were built.
However, it is said that these constructions put pressure on the financial condition of Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1415, Rennyo was born as the first son of Zonnyo.
He became a monk at Shoreiin Temple when he was 17.
His posthumous name was Kenji, and his priestly name was Rennyo.
In 1449, at age 35, Rennyo went to Hokuriku with his father Zonnyo.
Rennyo scattered the remains of Shinran to far Oshu for worship, and civilized lay follower groups.
On June 18, 1457 (old lunar calendar), Zonnyo entered nirvana at the age of 62.
Nyoenni, Zonno's wife, tried to make her son Rensho succeed as the chief priest, but instead Rennyo became the eighth chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple, supported by Nyojo, Zonnyo's brother.
At that time Rennyo was 43.
When Rennyo became the eighth chief priest, Hongwan-ji Temple declined and lost its status as the central temple of the sect, whereupon it became a subtemple of Shorenin Temple.
Around this time, Kyoto was seething from the Tsuchi Ikki (peasant riot).
Two years later there occurred a severe famine, and many people starved to death in the region of the Kamogawa River.
Many provinces were caught up in war, showing the seriousness of the situation.
Society developed gradually, and the grass roots increased in power.
Farmers improved their status through the increase of productivity in villages and the decline of lords of the manor, so that soon they were able to create autonomous villages (惣村).
Rennyo responded to this social situation quickly, and he energetically undertook missionary work.
Lay follower groups that sympathized with Rennyo's enthusiastic mission work spread from Kinki to the Tokai district.
Especially in Omi (Shiga Prefecture), many people believed Rennyo so that 無碍光本尊 was worshiped in many villages.
This greatly stimulated Enryaku-ji Temple, of the Tendai sect in Mt. Hieizan.
In 1465, Otani Hongwan-ji Temple was destroyed by priest soldiers of Mt. Hieizan.
In 1471, Rennyo escaped from Kyoto to Omi in order to avoid trouble, and moved to Yoshizaki Gobo in Echizen (Fukui Prefecture).
In 1475, Rennyo withdrew Yoshizaki Gobo in order to calm the unrest, and he undertook aggressive missionary work based in Deguchi of Kawachi (Osaka Prefecture).
As a result, many priests and lay people of the Jodo and Shodo sects came to believe in him.
In 1478, Rennyo moved from Deguchi to Yamashina and began to build Hongwan-ji Temple in January of the next year.
In 1483, halls such as 御影堂, Amida-do were completed, along with the main house.
(Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple)
In 1488, a riot group established a republic, 'a country ruled by farmers,' in Kaga Province.
Jinaimachi, Temple Town, were established by building both a temple and many grass-roots houses around the temple.
In this country, many visitors who made pilgrimages to the temple and many people of various occupations gathered, so that it flourished more than Kyoto City.
Hongwan-ji Temple's teachings spread throughout Japan, from Hokkaido Prefecture to Kyusyu.
Furthermore, the Khitan came to Japan from the northern part of China in order to learn the teachings.
Through the efforts of Rennyo, Hongwan-ji Temple became one of the largest religious organizations in Japan.
In 1489, Rennyo was 75.
He passed over Hongwan-ji Temple to Zitunyo.
In 1496, Rennyo was 82.
On September, he began to build a vihara in Osaka.
In 1497, Rennyo was 83.
Once the vihara in Osaka was complete, he went into retirement there.
(Osaka Gobo)
The place name 'Osaka' first appeared in Chapter 4, Section 15 of Rennyo's "Epistles of Rennyo Shonin (Gobunsho)" as of November 22, 1498, according to historical sources.
Although I do not know what kind of promise I made in ancient times, it has been three years since I saw this village, Shonai Osaka in the Ikutama Higashinari district of Sesshu, at the end of fall 1496, and built a vihara.
I think this must be a destiny that is closely connected to ancient times.'
In the spring of 1499,
Rennyo got worse.
on February 20 (old lunar calendar), he returned to Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple.
On March 25th (old lunar calendar), Rennyo entered nirvana.
Hongwan-ji Temple during the Sengoku period (oppression and forbiddance of lay follower groups by Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period))
The 100 years of the ninth Jitsunyo, the tenth Shonyo and the eleventh Kennyo were the chaotic age of civil war.
Hongwan-ji Temple supported the freedom movement which the grass roots requested in opposition to rulers, serving as the ideological driving force of social reform.
During that period, Hongwan-ji Temple became more influential and established itself as one of the largest religious sects as well as a strong social group.
In 1500, 照如 entered nirvana at the age of 22.
From 1504 to 1521
Lay follower groups in Kaga (Ishikawa Prefecture) stepped into the internal problems of the Asakura clan in Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture).
In 1504, the Go-Hojo clan in Sagami Province (Kanagawa Prefecture) prohibited belief in the Jodo Shinsu sect in the province, a prohibition that continued for 50 years.
In 1506, lay follower groups of Hongwan-ji Temple rose in revolt in the Kinki, Hokuriku and Tokai districts, all at roughly the same time.
In 1507, Masamoto HOSOKAWA was murdered as a result of trouble over clan succession.
Hongwan-ji Temple, which had had a close friendship with Masamoto since Rennyo, was afraid of becoming involved in that conflict so that Jitsunyo and Shinran's portraits were instead taken to Omi Katada.
They stayed there for nearly two years.
In 1516, it became an official temple of Emperor Gokashiwabara.
In 1521, the Nagao clan in Echigo Province (Niigata Prefecture) oppressed the lay follower groups of Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1521, Ennyo, the second son of Jitsunyo, entered nirvana at the age of 32.
On February 2, 1525 (old lunar calendar), Jitsunyo entered nirvana at the age of 68.
In 1532, it helped Harumoto HOSOKAWA and defeated the Hatakeyama clan with 20,000 troops of lay follower groups in the Kinki district.
In August of the same year, a coalition force of the Nichiren sect and Sadayori ROKKAKU of Omi burned down Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple.
(Hokke Ikki Riot (法華一揆))
It moved to the vihara in Osaka Ishiyama (Osaka Gobo).
(Osaka Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple)
In 1541 it had a peace conference with the Asakura clan.
In 1553, Kagetora NAGAO (Kenshin UESUGI) was reconciled with Hongwan-ji Temple in order to maintain a route to Kyoto.
On August 11, 1554 (old lunar calendar), Kennyo became a priest.
He was 12 years old.
On August 13, 1554 (old lunar calendar), Shonyo entered nirvana at the age of 39.
In 1556 it concluded a peace treaty with the Asakura clan.
In 1559, Kennyo was ordained as Monzeki, a temple in which resided a member of the nobility or the Imperial Family.
The Shimotsuma clan became 坊官 and Mikawa Honshu-ji Temple, Harima Hontoku-ji Temple, Kawachi Kensho-ji Temple (Yao City) became 院家.
In 1563, Hongwan-ji Temple's lay follower groups of Mikawa Province (Aichi Prefecture) fought against Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, but a year later they made peace.
Subsequently, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA oppressed and prohibited Hongwan-ji Temple lay follower groups in the province.
It was in 1583, 20 years later, that he ceased forbiddance.
The Shimazu clan in Satsuma (Kagoshima Prefecture) continued to forbid such groups until 1868.
In 1568, Nobunaga ODA went to Kyoto.
In 1569, Kosho-ji Temple, which was founded by Kenson, the second son of Kennyo, was ordained as Waki Monzeki (a subtemple in which resided a member of the nobility or the Imperial Family).
In 1570, Nobunaga ODA, whose goal was the integration of Japan, ordered Hongwan-ji Temple to withdraw from the moated castle city Ishiyama, a the headquarters of the Jodo Shinshu sect's lay follower groups and a strategic point against western Japan, which led to a war (the Ishiyama War).
It continued for about 10 years.
Sometime after the Ishiyama War, Hongwan-ji Temple came to be called Ishiyama Gobo.
In March 1581, Kennyo made peace with Nobunaga.
He withdraw from Ishiyama and moved the foundation of the temple to Saginomori Kii Province (Kii Saginomori Hongwan-ji Temple.)
The halls and buildings of Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple were all burned down.
In 1583, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI built Osaka-jo Castle at the place that included the old site of Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1583 it moved to a subtemple of Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple at Kaizuka, in Izumi Province (later Gansen-ji Temple (Kaizuka City)), along with Shinran's portrait.
(Kaizuka Hongwan-ji Temple)
In May 1585, it moved to Temma in Osaka and obtained a donation of land for a temple from Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.
In August of the same year, Amida-do was built first, and the following August 御影堂 of about 18 square meters was built.
(Osaka Temma Hongwan-ji Temple)
In 1591 came another donation of land for a temple from Hideyoshi; 御影堂 and Amida-do of Hongwan-ji Temple were built at the place where Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple now stands.
On November 24, 1592 (old lunar calendar), Kennyo entered nirvana at the age of 50.
Kennyo and his first son Kyonyo were opposed to each other over the end of the Ishiyama War.
After Kennyo's nirvana, Kyonyo succeeded as the chief priest.
Moreover, Kyonyo retired based on an assignment document and Junnyo succeeded as the twelfth chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple.
In 1602, Ieyasu donated land for a temple to the east of Hongwan-ji Temple.
The next year, Kyonyo built a hall and placed a wooden image of the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect from Myoan-ji Temple in Hitachi Province (Ibaraki Prefecture), which led to the establishment of another Hongwan-ji Temple.
Subsequently, more lay follower groups came to believe in Kyonyo, and thｒough repeated meetings and partings of lay follower groups the Hongwan-ji Temple groups were divided roughly in half as the eastern group and the western group.
For more than 400 years since then, both groups have continued their missionary work at the present places.
Godai Myoo (the five great Myoo) is a subject of faith in Buddhism and a combination of the five Myoo, which play a central role among Myoo, an honorific entity, which is specific to Mikkyo Esoteric Buddhism.
Myoo, which were originally produced as independent honorific entities, are arranged around Fudo Myoo.
In images such as statues and pictures, often Fudo Myoo is placed in the center, Gozanze Myoo at the east, Gundari Myoo at the south, Daiitoku Myoo at the west and Kongoyasha Myoo at the north.
Moreover, this arrangement is seen in Mikkyo (Tomitsu), which has been transmitted in the Shingon sect, but in the other Mikkyo (Daimitsu), which has been transmitted in the Tendai sect, Ususama Myoo is included in Godai Myoo instead of Kongoyasha Myoo.
Statues of the Godai Myoo were actively produced in Japan, while in China a few works were made.
In Japan, Mikkyo was very popular during the first stage of the Heian period, and Godai Myoo was enshrined as the principal image of Buddha in the Godanho ritual.
As a representative example in Japan, the statue, which was made in the first stage of the Heian period and is located at the auditorium of To-ji Temple, is well known (as a national treasure).
It is estimated that the statues was made around 839, when the auditorium was built.
As for the festivals related to Godai Myoo, Godairikisonninnoue is famous, and Kyoto Daigo-ji Temple performs it in February of each year.
In this festival, the power of Godai Myoo is magnified by burning a large ritualistic 'Saito Goma' outside, and on the last day the contest of strength by holding up a big Kagami-mochi of 150 kg has been held as a traditional event.
An ama is an unmarried woman over the age of 20 or a woman who becomes a priestess after the period of Shamini (a female Buddhist novice), even though she has been married.
She is also called Bikuni.
A nun of Christianity is also called Ama in some cases.
The type of woman who had her hair cut around shoulders was called 'Amasogi,' and girls with such a hairstyle were called 'Ama' in some cases.
Additionally, in recent times the word 'ama' was used in reference to a prostitute girl or woman.
The origin of the word 'ama' could be considered a transcription of the slang expression of 'ambaa' in Sanskrit, which means 'a good woman.'
Originally it meant Bikuni (bhikSuNii in Sanskrit) and a female Buddhist disciple opposite Biku, a male Buddhist disciple.
According to tradition, the first Bikuni were Makahajadai, Mahaprajapati, (Mahaaprajaapatii in Sanskrit), Shaka's adopted mother, and 500 women of the Shaka clan.
Shaka did not permit women to become priestesses at first, but admitted them based on their passion and meditationof Anan (Ananda) on the condition that they would keep eight promises, such as respecting Biku without slander.
By this, Yashotara (Yashodhara), Shaka's ex-wife, Bhadraa-Kapilaanii, ex-wife of Daikasho (Mahakasyapa), and Sama (Ksemaa) who was the princess of Bimbisara, Sister Uppalavanna and others became priestesses one after another and established a priestess group.
In Japan Ama generally means a woman who becomes a priestess, shaves her head, puts on clerical garment and practices ascetic training at Ama-dera Temple.
They are called Ama Nyudo, Ama Nyobo, Ama Goze or Ama Midai and so on.
The first ama in Japan were three women including Zenshin-ni, a daughter of Tatto SHIBA, who SOGA no Umako made them become priestess in 584.
They crossed to Kudara in order to learn Buddhism precepts (戒法), and lived at Sakurai-ji Temple after their return to Japan in 590.
At the beginning of Buddhism in Japan, the ama seemed to play the same role as a shrine maiden who worshiped God.
In 741 provincial monasteries were built around the country by an order of emperor Shomu, and provincial monasteries were built at the same time.
However, in accordance with the idea of the guard of nation becoming stronger, people tended to dislike that women (including ama) approached Buddhism from the standpoint of emphasizing that priests kept the precepts of Buddhism.
Therefore, giving Buddhist precepts (授戒) against ama was rejected and ama had been denied as priestess in Buddhism society for a long time in spite of the fact that there were many ama at that age.
Against this situation, Princess Shoshi, the empress of Emperor Junna, tried to make Kaidan (Ama Kaidan), the Buddhist ordination platform for women, but due to objections she could not.
FUJIWARA no Shoshi (a daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga), of the Palace of the Empress of Emperor Ichijo, placed Ama Kaidan at Hojo-ji Temple, which was built by Michinaga, when she became priestess in 1027, but it was lost in the devastation of the temple.
In medieval times, aristocratic women could become 'ama' called Sage Ama by having her hair cut around shoulders (of course they couldn't become ama formally because they could not be given the precepts of Buddhism).
Subsequently this custom became widespread, and women who were bereaved of husbands, divorced or had grown old were called 'ama' based on their appearance.
For example, Masako HOJO, a wife of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, became an ama and was called Ama Shogun because she wielded influence over government.
Kamakura new Buddhism regretted the former position to depreciate women and preached to relieve women, and Honen showed deep sentiment against Ama Nyudo, which was seemed to be a slang term for fools, as it were.
In addition, Eison built Ama Kaidan at Hokke-ji Temple, which was the Great Head Temple of old provincial nunneries, when it was rebuilt (in 1249).
Influenced by the missionary works of his Shingon Risshu sect, giving Buddhist precepts to ama had been gradually admitted.
In the Kanakura and Muromachi periods, Ama Gozan was determined in Kyoto and Kamakura.
A private shrine maiden, married with an itinerant Buddhist monk of Shugen, performed worship and divine revelation together, and also adopted the custom of having her hair cut so that a Shugen shrine maiden was called Bikuni.
Such bikuni went around the country, which led to the creation of the Haooyaku-bikuni (Yao-bikuni) legend.
Kumano-bikuni, who propagated the Kumano faith in various places, lectured on Rokudo-zu (i.e., paintings of the six paths of existence) are also called the "six realms" of reincarnation or Kumano Mandala (i.e., devotional paintings of the three shrines of Kumano).
During the Edo period, Uta Bikuni who served at a banquet appeared and some ama fell into prostitution.
Ama was seen in nearly every Buddhist sect in Japan, but after the Meiji Restoration the values of patriarchal authority based on Confucianism became widespread among people other than those of the former warrior class, so there was an example that ama was abolished, such as occurred in the Nichiren Shoshu sect in the Showa period, when nationalism also became influential.
Arakan (arhat in Sanskrit) is a saint in Buddhism who is eligible to receive respect and charity.
It is a transcript of "arhan," the nominative of "arhat" in Sanskrit.
It is also abbreviated as Rakan.
It is translated into 応供 (Ougu) in Chinese.
It was one of the honorific titles of Shaka.
For details on the temples that enshrine Arakan, see Rakan-ji Temple.
It is also called 殺賊 (Setsuzoku), transferred from killing (殺す (han)) rebel (賊 (ari)) of earthly desires and '不生,' transferred from a（不）＋ruh（生ずる), which means not to relive in a wandering world (past, present and future existences, or three realms) after nirvana, but these are vulgar views of the origin of word.
It is originally a derivative word of the root, arh-, which means 'valuable', 'respectable' and so on.
Originally, in the general sense it meant 'respectable disciplinant' in the Indian religion.
In early Buddhism it meant the top level that a disciplinant could attain.
Arakan-ka, the state of full attainment of arhatship in which it isn't necessary to learn any more, is called 'Mugakui (無学位).'
As for the grades below that, Fugen-ka (the consummation of the stage of the non-returner), Ichirai-ka (one who has fully consummated the stage of the once-returner) and Yoru-ka (one who has fully attained the stage of the stream-enterer) are called 'Ugakui (有学（うがく）位).'
(Shiko Shika, four accesses and four accomplishments)
Especially in Mahayana Buddhism, Shomon was called Arakan and was distinguished from Buddha critically.
However, in Mahayana Buddhism it is referred to as two vehicles, and Arakan and Dokkaku are said to be unable to become 'Buddha.'
Additionally, there is a theory that they cannot even go to 'Hell' but must repeat reincarnation at the same level.
In China and Japan, 16 disciples who swore to keep Buddhism were respected as the 16 Rakans.
Moreover, 500 disciples who gathered in the first editorial meeting of Buddhist sutra (結集（けつじゅう）were called the 500 Rakans and were eagerly respected.
Particularly, the Zen sect emphasized that Shaka's true dharma　(正法) was transmitted directly to Arakan, Daikasho (Mahakasyapa) and produced pictures of the 500 Rakans, and statues of Rakan idealized the figures of Shaka's disciples training, which were later worshipped to pray for keeping true dharma.
According to "Daiarakan Nandai Shosetsu (Hojuki)," it means sixteen Arakans who live in this world forever by Buddha's order and serve as redeemers of living things.
Bindorabaradaja, Pindolabharadraja
The first of 16 Rakans
It is known as Binzuru-sonja or, in other words, Obinzuru-sama.

Sutra,' of the Buddhist sutra (Kyoten, Kyoden, sutra in Sanskrit, sutta in Pali), means a record of Shaka's teachings among Buddhist scriptures.
The way of ascetic training and religious precepts is called 'vinaya'; commentaries of Buddhist sutra are called 'abhidharma'; and sutra, vinaya and abhidharma are collectively called 'Tripitaka.'
Buddhist sutra' means only 'sutra' in a narrow sense, but in a broad sense it means all Buddhist scriptures.
In that sense it has the same meaning as Buddhist scriptures.
The major Buddhist sutras include Hokku-kyo Sutra (Dhammapada), Agon-kyo Sutra, Hannya-kyo Sutra, Yuima-kyo Sutra, Nehan-kyo Sutra (Sutra of The Great Nirvana), Kegon-kyo Sutra, Hokke Sanbu-kyo Sutra (Threefold Lotus Sutra), the Three Sutras of the Pure Land (Jodosanbu-kyo Sutra), Kongocho-kyo Sutra, etc.
It can generally be classified into primitive sutras and Mahayana sutras.
Primitive sutras include five sutras of Pali and the Agon-kyo Sutra group (as translated into Chinese), and it is said that portions of these sutras adhere relatively closely to Syakamuni's words.
The Mahayana sutras were created by Mahayana Buddhism religious associations beginning around the beginning of the A.D. epoch, so they have no direct relationship to the historical Syakamuni.
They include the Hannya-kyo sutras, the Hokke-kyo sutra, the Kegon-kyo sutra and others..
As for languages, there are various translations ranging from Indian dialects such as Pali and Sanskrit to Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian and Manchurian, and a part of the sutra written in the Tangut language remains as well.
They have been translated into Japanese from Chinese, and Pali is also included in this.
Additionally, sutra, vinaya, abhidharma and their commentaries were edited into a series called "Daizo-kyo Sutra (the Tripitaka)" or "Issai-kyo Sutra (Complete Buddhist Scriptures)."
These works were often implemented by order of the Emperor in China, where they set a tough standard to incorporate scriptures so that the scriptures that were not of the standard were called 'Zougai (蔵外).'
Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra, edited in Japan in 1934, generally includes scriptures edited or written in China and Japan.
Sutra (sutta) is a collection of Skaka's and disciples' records of sayings and deeds.
Once Shaka reached nirvana, in order to transmit his teachings correctly his disciples held a meeting to edit Buddhist sutras (Ketuju, 結集) and began to classify them.
However, from 100 to 200 years after Shaka's nirvana, the religious association split into many Hinayana, and each one came to succeed and keep its own Tripitaka.
Apparently, they were written in each respective language of the various regions in India.
Only the Pali Buddhist sutra of Theravada Buddhism, which was transmitted to Sri Lanka, exists in complete form; it is used widely in the Southeastern Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar.
The contents are as provided below:
Vinayapitaka: Kyofunbetsu (経分別, Commentary on the Texts of Religious Precepts), Kendo (けん度, Systems and Rules of Religious Associations) and an appendix.
Kyozo, storehouse of sutra: the five sections of diigha-nikaaya, majjhima-nikaaya, saMyutta-nikaaya, AGguttara-nikaa and khuddaka-nikaaya.
The former four sections correspond to "Agon-kyo Sutra," as translated into Chinese.
Abhidhamma-piTaka: the seven sections of DhammasaGgaNI, VibhaGga, DhAtukathA, Puggala-paJJatti, KathAvatthu, Yamaka and PaTThAna.
These were written gradually until around 2 B.C. - 1 B.C. and are said to have been transmitted to Sri Lanka around 1 B.C.; subsequently, many commentaries, essentials and history books of Zogai were produced.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Pali Text Society was founded in London and published a revised edition of original sutras, while in Japan the 65 volumes of "Nanden Tripitaka" (1935-1941), including some Zogai scriptures, were published as a complete translation.
It should be remembered that Pali Buddhist sutra haven't necessarily kept the original words.
In "Agon-kyo Sutra," as translated into Chinese, there are descriptions that are older than those transmitted to Theravada Buddhism or those that seem to have been translated into Chinese from Sanskrit.
In that sense, it is not only a false expression but also an incorrect one to think the Pali Buddhist sutra keep the original forms.
In Tibet, the translation of individual Buddhist scriptures was begun by order of King Songtsan Gambo in the seventh century; the translation of Buddhist sutra into the Tibetan language was begun by Tonmisanboda (トンミサンボータ).
In accordance with the ascendance of Buddhism as the national religion at the end of the eighth century, the translation of Buddhist scriptures became a national project of the kingdom; thus the work of collecting and translating Buddhist scriptures from India encyclopedically and systematically was begun and completed in the space of just a few decades.
In order to translate the original scriptures in Sanskrit, Tibetan grammar and vocabulary were set up, and due to the efforts of Shanyeshede (シャンイェシェデ), Kawaperutseku (カワペルツェク), Chokuroruigentsen (チョクロルイゲンツェン) and others it was completed in about 824.
As for the classification of Buddhist sutras in Tibetan Buddhism, separation into two parts--'Bkah-hgyur' and 'Bstan-hgyur'--was given more value than that into the three parts of 'sutra, vinaya and abhidharma,' which is common to other Buddhist countries.
Bkah-hgyur means 'hgyur (translation)' of 'Bkah,' i.e., Syakamuni's word itself, and Bstan-hgyur means 'hgyur (translation)' of 'Bstan,' i.e., a commentary of 'Bkah' by scholars of Indian Buddhism such as Ryuju.
In Tibetan, Buddhist sutras were for a long time widely distributed as manuscripts in order to reveal religious devotion, but in 1410 Emperor Yongle of China's Ming dynasty ordered the carving of wooden blocks of the Tripitaka as souvenirs for Tibetan feudal lords and religious associations that sent messengers to China; this custom was incorporated into Tibet and subsequently led to the carving of various Buddhist sutras.
Beijing edition: Bkah-hgyur of the Yongle edition (1410), Bkah-hgyur of Wanli (1606), Bkah-hgyur of the Kangxi edition (1692), Bstan-hgyur of the Yongzheng edition (1724)
Litang edition (1621-24)
NaTang edition: Bkah-hgyur (1732), Bstan-hgyur (1773)
Dege edition: Bkah-hgyur (1733), Bstan-hgyur (1742)
Lhasa edition: Bkah-hgyur (1936)
Moreover, in China since the 1990s as part of the Chinese Tripitaka project, which will be published in the Western style, Bstan-hgyur (including many manuscripts and editions of past times) has been edited.
The Tripitaka of Buddhist sutras in the above editions includes many commentaries on Mahayana Buddhism sutras, particularly late-stage Indian Buddhism documents of which the original scriptures and translations of Chinese do not exist, so that it has important meaning in the research of late-stage Indian Buddhism.
Tibetan translation is near to a literal translation of Sanskrit, and it is easy to deduce to original words, so that it is considered important to the research of original forms of Buddhist sutra that have been translated into Chinese, particularly when the originals no longer exist.
The rNying-ma School, one of the four major religious sects in Tibet, characteristically has many sutras and abhidharmas, which insist that Buddhist sutras (gter-ma) hidden underground during a certain time were after a long time discovered by predetermined gter ston (people who excavated hidden Buddhist sutras).
The discovery of gter-ma (hiding Buddhist sutras) has continued since the medieval period, but it is often considered as fiction by persons involved in excavation from other sects.
This sect has its own Tripitaka, the contents and composition of which are different from those of the above editions.
A project for the translation of Buddhist sutras in China was begun in the latter period of the second century and continued virtually without interruption until the end of the eleventh century.
In accordance with the progress of translation into Chinese, it became necessary to collect and classify the sutras of the Chinese editions and distinguish the true Buddhist sutras from the false ones, so that at the end of the fourth century Doan SHAKU wrote "Shuri Shu-kyo Mokuroku (亡佚)," the first record of sutra, and at the beginning of the sixth century Soyu edited "Shutsu Sanzo Kishu (the Chu sanzang ji ji)."
These 衆経 (or Tripitaka) were said to be called 'Issai-kyo Sutra' in the northern Wei dynasty, meaning the Pei dynasty (China), while they were called 'Tripitaka' in Liang (Nanchao), meaning the Nan dynasty (China); both titles were established in Sui and the beginning of the Tang dynasty, and the form of manuscripts were determined as comprising 17 letters in a line.
In the Sui and Tang periods many records of sutra were edited, such as "Daito Naitenroku" by Dosen, but what influenced later ages was the 20-volume "Kaigen Shakukyoroku," which was completed in 730 by Chisho.
Following the classification of Buddhist sutra since the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (China), this classified them into the Mahayana Tripitaka, Hinayana Tripitaka and Seiken Shuden (聖賢集伝) and decided that the number of Buddhist scriptures that should be edited into the Tripitaka as 5,048 volumes by designating Mahayana sutra as Godaibu (五大部) of Hannya, Hoshaku (宝積), Taishu (大集), kegon and nirvana.
the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (China)
The printing block of the first edition of the Tripitaka was carved at Shu (Sichuan Province) from 971 to 983 in the era of Kyoin CHO (Song Taizong) of the Northern Sung dynasty, and was printed at 'Sutra Printing Academy,' which was built in Kaifeng, the capital.
This was called 'the Tripitaka in Shu edition' in old times; today, however, it is generally called 'Kaihozo' based on the era name at the time of the first block or as the 'rescript edition' because it was carved by the founder's imperial rescript.
It was edited in "Kaigen Shakukyoroku."
It was a rolled book in which each line consisted of 14 letters standardized by 'Shu big letter book (蜀大字本)' at that time.
This was a project for good deeds by Sung, and was given to neighboring countries such as Xi Xia, Goryeo and Japan.
Chonen, a priest of Todai-ji Temple who went to Sung in 983, was given 481 boxes and 5,048 volumes of Tripitaka and 40 volumes of Buddhist sutras newly translated; he brought them back to Japan, but because they were placed at Hojo-ji Temple, which was built by FUJIWARA no Michinaga, they vanished in smoke along with the temple.
However, since it was hand-copied eagerly as the newly arrived Tripitaka, copies remain in various places.
Twelve original books of Kaihozo have been discovered worldwide, among which in Japan each book has been in the possession of Nanzen-ji Zen Temple in Kyoto and the Shodo Hakubutsukan Museum in Tokyo.
During the Jin period, the 'Jin edition' was produced from 1147 to 1173.
This was also written as 14 letters in each line.
It was for a long time a phantom Tripitaka, but in 1933 it was discovered at a temple in Chogi-ken, Shanxi Province.
For this reason it is also called 'Chogi-zo (趙城蔵).'
Since 1984, "Chuka Daizo-kyo Sutra (Chinese Tripitaka)中華大蔵経" (facsimile edition) has been published, having this Tripitaka as a copied text.
Additionally, during the Yuan period it had been repaired several times (repaired edition in Yuan).
The Tripitaka was carved in around 990 - 1010 by Kitai.
In the 16 prefectures of Yan Yun that were ceded to Kitai from Jin, it was published as a national project by referring to a text of Sekkyo (Sekkei) (The Scriptures Inscribed on Stone), which had been kept at Fangshan since the time of Sui.
Although this Tripitaka was a phantom Tripitaka as well as a Jin edition, the 12 volumes of the Kitai edition were discovered in 1982 from a Buddha statue located at the wooden tower in Bukkyu-ji Temple, an old temple at Yingxian, in Shanxi Province.
With this discovery it was confirmed that the Kitai edition had a relationship with Sekkyo of Fangshan, and it was verified to have been written following the standard form of 17 letters in each line.
From the Southern Sung to the Ming dynasty, private editions of the Tripitaka had been published in various places.
The first edition was 'Tokaku Zenin Temple (等覚禅院) edition' (1075-1112), which was begun at Tokaku Zenin Temple in FuZhou (Fujian Province) at the end of the eleventh century.
This was a project to publish a private edition through the dedication of believers, as opposed to publication as a national project like the Northern Sung dynasty edition or the Kitai edition.
After that, the following Daizo-kyo were published continuously: 'KaiYuanSi Temple edition' of FuZhou (1112-1151), 'Shikei-ban edition (思渓版)' of Huzhou (1126-1132), 'Shaseki-ban edition (磧砂版)' carved in Suzhou City (1232-1305), and the 'Puning edition' of Hang Zhou (1277-1290).
These lineages adopted the standard form of 17 letters in each line.
At the end of the Ming dynasty, 'Banreki-ban Daizo-kyo Sutra (Kinzan-zo) (万暦版大蔵経（徑山蔵）)' was published, having a new style of dual-page print as opposed to the former rolled book.
Ryuzo (龍蔵),' the Tripitaka of Ching and the above-mentioned Tetsugen edition and Manjizo (卍字藏) in Japan are classified as being of this lineage.
In Goryeo the reprinted edition of 'Kaihozo' was published in 1010 (Korai Hatsucho-bon, 高麗初雕本), and after its wood blocks were burned in a battle with Yuan forces it was carved again as Korai Saichobon (高麗再雕本) in 1236.
At this time, Shuso (Moriso, 守其), who was responsible for this edition and edited "Korai New Tripitaka Revision Record (高麗国新雕大蔵経校正別録)," revised the first edition by referring to the Kitai edition.
The revised book, "Tripitaka Koreana," the wood blocks for which are still housed in Haeinsa Temple, has a few false entries but is considered to be the best text that remains as an old form, so that it was adopted as a copied text in compact editions of Tripitaka in the Meiji and Taisho periods as well as the above-mentioned "Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra" because 'it is superior to other books' by conflating the Northern Sung dynasty edition with the Kitai edition.
However, Shuso conflated only the Kaihozo, Korai Hatsucho-bon and Kitai editions, and Kaihozo was original as opposed to the Korai Hatsucho-bon, which was a reprinted edition, so that their texts basically indicate the same lineage.
Therefore, he conflated only between the Northern Sung dynasty editions and the Kitai edition.
Later, in accordance with the progress of text critique, it came to be said that the reputation of 'the best text that remains an old form' was the illusion by 'the first published Tripitaka.'
In fact, the Tripitaka in the Scriptures Inscribed on Stone at Fangshan as well as in the Kitai edition, which were the local texts of places such as Beijing (in Hebei Province) and Shanxi Province, or the Southern Sung edition, 'Shikei Shifuku-zo (思渓資福蔵)' and Yuan edition, 'Funei-zo,' which were lineages of the Issai-kyo sutra manuscripts of Choan (the capital from the Han through Tang dynasties) are often better texts.
As opposed to those texts, there is a theory that the texts of 'Kaihozo (rescript edition)' and the 'Korean Edition (高麗版)' lineage keep only the contents of the Issai-kyo sutra, which was a lineage of manuscript spread throughout Shu (Sichuan Province).
However, another theory asserts that the edition of Choan, the center of Buddhism, had been reformed with each collection of manuscripts and became sophisticated as a text, so that the Shu edition of the local version has kept the original form adversely.
For example, regarding a description of the beginning of "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra" translated by Kumaraju, in Kaihozo it was written as "如是我聞一時 佛住・・・," while in 'Shikei Shifuku-zo' and 'Funei-zo'; but later, in 'Kinzan-zo,' it was written as "如是我聞一時婆伽婆住・・・," so that as this example shows, it was sometimes revised following the new style of Chinese Buddhist sutra that emerged during the era.
Additionally, in a printed book, "Taisho New Daizo-kyo," there is information on the castigation of such texts as the above 'Shikei Shifuku-zo' (Sung book), 'Funei-zo' (Yuan book) and 'kizan-zo' (Ming book) against a copied text of 'Tripitaka Koreana.'
For details on the Tibetan Tripitaka, see the article of 'The Tibetan Tripitaka.'
In Japan, the approximately 5,000 volumes that Genbo brought back in 735 were assumed to be the authorized Tripitaka at that time.
From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, "Issai-kyo Sutra in Sung Edition" was introduced to Japan through the efforts of priests who went to Sung, such as Eisai, Chogen Shunjobo and Keisei.
1648: The "Kanei-ji Temple edition (Tenkai edition)" was completed by Nankobo Tenkai with support from the Tokugawa shogunate.
1681: Doko TETSUGEN completed "the Obaku-ban Tripitaka (Tetsugen edition)."
It is famous because it was adopted in the textbook on morals (修身) in Japan before World War II as the Tripitaka that the Zen master TETSUGEN had completed through trials and tribulations, but it has errors in terms of the characters used, mostly among the successive Tripitakas.
This is because it was published based on the reversed and split actual text of the Tripitaka in the Ming edition.
1885: "The Dainihon Revised Tripitaka Compact Edition (大日本校訂大藏經縮刷藏本) (The Tripitaka in Compact Edition) (Tokyo Kokyo Shoin)" was published.
1902: "Manjizo"　(Kyoto Zokyo Shoin) was published.
1912: "Dainihon Zokuzo-kyo Sutra "(Nihon Zokyo-in) was completed.
Although it is criticized as having many insufficient castigations, what contributes to the world of Buddhism and the research on Buddhism is the 100 volumes of "Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra" (Taisho Issai-kyo Kanko-kai, 大正一切経刊行会) produced under the editorship of Junjiro TAKAKUSU and Kaikyoku WATANABE.
It took 10 years (from 1924 to 1934) to conflate various books with a copied text of Korean Haeinsa Temple, and it consists of Shozo (55 volumes), Zokuzo (30 volumes), Showa Hobo Mokuroku (three volumes) as well as pictures and images (12 volumes).
Buddhist sutras in Chinese were also translated into Japanese, such as "Kokuyaku Tripitaka," "Kokuyaku Issai-kyo Sutra (国訳一切経)," and "Showa Shinshu Kokuyaku Daizo-kyo Sutra."
Additionally, the text database of "Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra" of Tokyo University (SAT) and other projects such as the Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (CBETA) have been promoted in order to produce an electronic text of Taisho Shinshu Daizo-kyo Sutra, and they are open to the public with certain restrictions.
Jodo-kyo is a teaching for people to become Buddha in the Land of Bliss of Amitabha Buddha.
It is also called Jodo-mon (Gateway of the Pure Land) or Jodo-shiso.
The word 'Jodo' originated in China, but ideologically it was first modeled on the 'Buddha Lands' in the early Mahayana Buddhism of India, and each Jodo of many Buddhas was explained.
However, in China and Japan, in accordance with the prevalence of the faith for Amitabha Buddha, Jodo generally has meant Jodo of Amitabha Buddha.
The word 'Jodo-kyo,' which Zendo of the Tang dynasty described as 'I want to listen to Jodo-kyo carefully' ("Hojisan (Tengyogyodogan Ojo Jodo Hojisan)," is used in the same sense.
Jodo-kyo was established in the age when Mahayana Buddhism was evoked in India, and it started with the editing of "Muryoju-kyo Sutra" and "Amida-kyo Sutra" in around 100 A.D.
Over a long span of time, Jodo-kyo became widespread in India.
There exist many theories of Mahayana Buddhism on Amitabha Buddha and the Land of Bliss, among which the theories emphasizing the concept of a belief in Jodo after death are shown below:
"Jujubibasharon (Basharon)," which is said to have been written by Ryuju around 150-250, ('Igyo-hon No. 9' of Vol. 5 in all 17 volumes).
"Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge (Jodo-ron, Ojo-ron)," written by Seshin (4-5 A.D.).
Meanwhile, the original Sanskrit text of "Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra" has not been discovered, so it is assumed that its broad outline was established in Central Asia around 4-5 A.D. and that factors related to China were added during the process of translation.
However, it had a considerable effect on Jodo-kyo in China and Japan.
In China, Jodo-kyo sutras were transmitted beginning in the latter half of the second century, and Eon (the Eastern Jin) (334-416) of Mt. Rozan founded Byakuren-sha, an association of Nenbutsu, based on "Hanju Zanmai-kyo Sutra" at the beginning of the fifth century.
Soon, considering 'Three Sutras of the Pure Land (Jodosanbu-kyo Sutra)' as the basic sutras,
Doran (476-542), centered at Xuanzhongsi Temple in Shanxi Province, wrote "The Commentary of Muryoju-kyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge (The Commentary of Oji-ron),"
Doshaku (562-645) wrote "Anrakushu,"
and Zendo (613-681) wrote "Kammuryojukyosho (Kangyosho),"
so that Jodo-kyo was established with a central focus on Invocation of the Buddha's Name, which was appropriate to the world of Mappo (Age of the Final Dharma) of Gojoku Akuse (五濁悪世).
Later, Enichi (680-748), Hossho (? - around 777) of Goe Nenbutsu (五会念仏) and others enforced the tendency to integrate Jodo-kyo in other groups such as the Zen sect.
In Japan, Jodo-kyo (Jodo-shiso) was transmitted in around the first half of the seventh century, and Ennin (794-864) transmitted the way of nenbutsu-zanmai (nenbutsu samadhi, or mental absorption in the nenbutsu) of Mt. Wutai Shan in China to Mt. Hiei-zan in the first half of the ninth century.
Soon Ryogen (912-985) wrote "Gokurakujodo Kuhon Ojo-gi" and Genshin (942-1017) wrote "Ojoyoshu (Collection on the Essentials for Birth)," and as a result the Tendai Jodo sect became prevalent.
Byohoin Temple was built by FUJIWARA no Yorimichi, based on Jodo-shiso.
Jodo-shiso in the Heian period was believed mainly by the aristocracy of Kyoto, but Kuya (903-972) preached Jodo-kyo to the grass roots as well and was called the "saint of the city."
Ryonin (1072-1132) preached Yuzu Nenbutsu (融通念仏) (Dai Nenbutsu), which said 'one Nenbutsu is integrated in all other people's Nenbutsu,' and became a founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect.
In the other sects (except for the Tendai sect) there also existed Nenbutsu priests such as Eikan (1033-1111) of the Sanron sect and Kakuban (1095- 1143) of the Shingon sect.
From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, by writing "Senchaku Hongan Nenbutsu-shu (Senchaku-shu)" Honen (1133-1212) established Jodo sect and determined the basic sutras by adding "Jodo-ron" of Tenjin to "Three Sutras of the Pure Land," namely "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra" (translated by Sogi Kosogai), "Bussetsu Kan Muryoju-kyo Sutra" (translated by Ryuso Kyoryoyasha) and "Bussetsu Amida-kyo Sutra" (translated by Yoshin Kumaraju) ('Three Sutras and One Theory').
Shinran (1173-1262), a disciple of Honen, wrote "Kenjodoshinjitsukyogyoshomonrui" and others, developed the Jodo sect and later became a founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect.
Ippen (1239-1289) visited many provinces for the sake of missionary work and founded the Jishu sect.
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, Jodo sect, Jodo Shinshu sect and Jishu sect, which began from the latter half of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, developed in a later age and formed extensive lineages in Japanese Buddhism up to the present.
"Heart of Great Perfect Wisdom Sutra (Hannya Shingyo, Prajñā-pāramitā-hṛdaya in Sanskrit)" is one of the Buddhist sutras that preaches the Ku (Buddhism) of Mahayana Buddhism and Prajna thought.
There are various names depending on the sect, so it is also called Bussetsu Maka Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra, Maka Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra and Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra.
It is abbreviated as "Heart Sutra (心経)."
Additionally, a Chinese title accompanies the word '経 (sutra),' but in the title of Sanskrit text there is no word 'sutra' that corresponds to '経.'
It is said that in the text of less than 300 characters the essence of Mahayana Buddhism is preached, and it has been used as one of the sutras for recitation without regard to whether one is a priest or a lay person (except for certain sects).
"Hannya Shingyo" is generally said to be the essence or a representation of the 600 volumes of "Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra (Daihannyaharamitta-kyo Sutra)," but it consists of the abstract from "the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra" ("Dai-Hannya-kyo Sutra") and "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra"("Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra") with the addition of a litany (Sktdhāranī), which is included in "Darani Jikkyo Sutra" at the end.
While it summarizes the themes of the Prajnaparamita-sutras as 'Ku (Buddhism),' it preaches its importance and glorifies the attainment of enlightenment; moreover, it emphasizes the magical aspect of Buddhism, especially with the litany added at the end.
The 'Heart' of Hannya Shingyo is a translation of 'hṛdaya' in Sanskrit (which means 'heart'), or an important thing, but it also means magic (litany, mantra).
Therefore, while Hannya Shingyo is said to be a Buddhist sutra that preaches the view of Ku, it is also said to be a Buddhist sutra of litany.
Generally speaking, the Prajnaparamita sutras do not include magical words except for what became Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) in the latter stage.
Considering the above, "Hannya Shingyo" is extremely peculiar as one of the Prajnaparamita sutras.
Additionally, there is a theory that since the original title of the Sanskrit text does not include the word "sutra," an invocation text made for litany (soji, 総持) came to be considered as a sutra in China.
Moreover, in "Shuri Shu-kyo Mokuroku" (mostly included in "Shutsu Sanzo Kishu, the Chu sanzang ji ji" edited by Soyu, a priest of Liang (Nanchao)) edited by Doan SHAKU in eastern Jin, the oldest catalog of Buddhist sutra, there are titles of "Maka Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1" and "Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1, alternative version"; thus there is a theory that a magic ritual had been established before Hannya Shingyo was established as a sutra.
Additionally, while in the dainibun-Kudokuhon (第二分功德品) No. 32 of "the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra (Dai-Hannya-kyo Sutra)," 'Hannya Haramita' (a word or an idea itself) is considered to be the great spell (大明呪), in "Hannya Shingyo," the phrase 'Hannya Haramita Shu' is set in to add the litany of Zo-mitsu (Mixed Esoteric Buddhism).
Various theories on the meaning of litany have been proposed by such people as Shoko WATANABE and the philosopher Hajime NAKAMURA, but there is no authorized translation.
Original
It is said that Ryuju in India wrote "Daichidoron," a commentary on the Prajnaparamita-sutras during the second to third centuries, and there is a theory assuming that Hannya Shingo was established around this time.
However, the oldest existing Sanskrit book is the Baiyo-bon edition housed at Horyu-ji Temple, which is said to be a manuscript from the latter part of the eighth century (introduced in 609 according to a legend), and it was written in a later age than the time when Buddhist sutras were translated into Chinese.
Moreover, manuscripts that remain in Tibet and Nepal were also made in a subsequent age and their original forms aren't known, so it is suspected that they might be fake sutras.
Translation into Chinese
According to the documents of a later age, "Maka Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1" was translated by Zhi Qian, who came from Central Asia in the third century, and "Hannya Haramitsu Shinju Vol. 1, alternative version" was translated by Kumaraju; however, "Shuri Shu-kyo Mokuroku" states that their translators are unknown, so it is doubtful that they were translated by these people.
The former no longer exists, and the latter is regarded as "Maka Hannya Haramitsu Daimyo Jukyo" translated by Raju included in Tripitaka, but since Raju began to translate in 402 it could not have been translated in 385, when Doan SHAKU died.
Additionally, the majority of the text corresponds to the text of "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra" translated by Kumaraju of Tripitaka in the Sung, Yuan and Ming editions, but since So-ban Daizo-kyo Sutra (Tripitaka in the Sung edition) was published in the latter part of the twelfth century it is doubtful that this text was translated by Raju.
It is said that Genjo, who had returned from India in 649, also translated "Hannya Shingyo."
As an idea on the history of sutra translation, Buddhist sutras translated into Chinese before Kumaraju are called 'ancient translations,' those after Kumaraju and before Genjo are called 'old translations' and those after Genjo are called 'new translations' (as per the classification of sutra translations).
However, in the aspect of philology the majority of the text was an abstraction from "Maka Hannya Haramitsu-kyo Sutra" of Tripitaka in the Korean edition (in the first part of the thirteenth century) translated by Kumaraju, and was different from the corresponding part of the "Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra" translated by Genjo, so that there is also suspicion about whether it was translated by Genjo, as well as the Buddhist sutra, which was said to be a translation by Raju.
The oldest text that is currently considered to be a translation by Genjo is the text that is added to the end of "Shogyojo" in the Shuo Shogyojo (Ji wang shen jiao xu, Shuji Shogyojo) monument at Hongfusi Temple (Kofukuji Temple), which was built in 672.
However, because it had been a long time since 648 when Taiso (Tang tai zong) gave "Shogyojo," and there is a description in the afterword that 'embroidered by order of the Emperor," there is a theory that this epigraph came to be assessed as a translation by Genjo based on Kumaraju's translation in order to glorify Genjo's great work after his death.
Additionally, in "Hannya Haramitashin-gyo Sutra Yusan," written by Jion Daishi Ki, a disciple of Genjo, there is a description to indicate that theory.
Moreover, although "Hannya Shingyo," which is said to be a translation by Genjo, became the most widespread for reading and invocation, this is unusual considering that the Buddhist sutra translated by Raju had since ancient times been used more often than the Buddhist sutra translated by Genjo.
Additionally, sloppy reading of "the Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra" is often performed but the text of the Buddhist sutra itself is rarely read and recited.
Representative widespread texts that have additional punctuation marks are as follows:
Moreover, in both Raju's and Genjo's translations, 'Hannya Haramitsu (Hannya Haramita),' 'Sariputra,' '阿耨多羅三藐三菩提,' 'Bosatsu (菩提薩&22517)' and the last 'shu' were not translated into Chinese and showed transcriptions of Sanskrit without changes.
Moreover, in the text that is said to be a translation by Genjo there are more than 10 differences in words depending on the edition, examples of which are as follows:
空即是色受想行識亦復如是（大正蔵）
空即是色受想行識等亦復如是 (lineage of the Hosso-shu sect such as the Horyu-ji Temple edition)
In Japan various sects, especially the Hosso-shu, Tendai, Shingon and Zen sects, use Hannya Shingyo and interpret it individually.
However, the Jodo Shinshu sect regards "Three Sutras of the Pure Land (Jodosanbu-kyo Sutra)" as the fundamental Buddhist sutra, and the Nichiren and Hokke sects regard "Myohorenge-kyo" as that, so they don't recite the Hannya Shingyo.
This is because they don't need to use it from the viewpoint of their dharma, not because they deny the Heart Sutra.
For example, Kozui OTANI, who was a chief priest of the Jodo Shinshu sect at Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple, wrote a commentary on the Hannya Shingyo.
The Tendai sect values it highly as a 'fundamental Hokke (根本法華).'
Moreover, there is a commentary that is said to have been written by Saicho.
In the Shingon sect it is read and recited, and is a subject of 観誦.
It uses it as one of the Buddhist sutra for daily use (see the article of Hannyashin-gyo Hiken).
In the case where one reads and recites it repeatedly, traditionally he starts reading from 'Bussetsu' in the beginning for the first time but begins reading from 'Maka' for the second time without reading 'Bussetsu.'
Because Kukai, the founder of the sect, emphasized Hannya Shingyo, various priests of this sect have written commentaries.
Among those, the works by Kakusho TAKAGAMI, Yuko MIYASAKA and others in the postwar period of Japan are well known.
"Lecture on Hannya Shingyo" by TAKAGAMI, which was broadcasted via NHK radio in the prewar days, was very popular at that time.
It is considered very highly among the commentaries written in modern Japanese, and it receives high praise from scholars and priests of other sects.
In the Jodo Shu sect it is recited at mealtime and so on.
In the Jishu sect it is necessary to recite it three times in front of the shelf of gods that enshrines the soul of Kumano Taisha Shrine after worship of the shrine and morning devotions.
It is also used daily in some cases.
The Rinzai sect regards it as one of the daily Buddhist sutras.
Additionally, Ikkyu, Bankei and Hakuin have made interpretations.
It is often asserted that Hannya Shingyo is a Buddhist sutra that reveals the primary figure of one's heart.
The Soto sect regards it as one of the daily Buddhist sutras.
While the founder Dogen interpreted it, Tenkei's interpretation 'Kanjizai Bosatsu is yourself' is famous.
In addition, many priests such as Ryokan and Santoka TANEDA have tried to implement Hannya Shingyo.
Ryokan left numerous manuscripts of the Hannya Shingyo, and TANEDA made haiku from the Hannya Shingyo.
In the Shugen-do mountaineering ascetic, practitioners (such as itinerant Buddhist monks) recite it when they practice.
In the Shinto religion, some sects recite it.
When it is read and recited in the shrine (in front of the gods), it is read from 'Maka' without reading 'Bussetsu' at the beginning.
For ordinary people it is regarded as a Buddhist sutra of 'miracle-working mantra' instead of a Buddhist sutra that preaches 'Ku,' and some people interpret that it 'erases (空ずる)' the power of evil spirits.
There is an old belief that Hannya Shingyo benefits the recovery from illness, which is seen in "Nihon Ryoiki."
Many people carried it as a charm or hand-copied it in order to pray for recovery from illness.
Additionally, it was recited at shrines.
It is well known that Hokiichi HANIWA read Hannya Shingyo at Kameido Temmangu Shrine and prayed for the success of "Gunsho Ruiju."
During the Edo period, E-shin-gyo (Heart Sutra in Picture Version), was produced for illiterates.
According to "Hannyashin-gyo no Nazo," written by Meiji MOMOSE, this was created by Genemon YAWATA in Ninohe-gun, Iwate Prefecture from 1688 to 1703 for the sake of illiterates and became popular in various provinces through essays, and even literate people enjoyed it as a kind of rebus.
It is often hand-copied concurrently with the practice of manuscripts.
It is also printed on towels and is very common.
Although numerous commentaries have been published, some of them make the mistake of interpreting the original intension of Hannya Shingyo, so that Buddhist scholars sound the alarm.
As the major translation and commentary in modern times, a book of Iwanami-bunko, a translation from the original Sanskrit by Hajime NAKAMURA and Kazuyoshi KINO, "Lecture on Hannya Shingyo," written by Kakusho TAKAGAMI and "Hannyashin-gyo Nyumon," written by Taido MATSUBARA, which interprets from the viewpoint of a priest of the Rinzai sect, have been published and reprinted many times so that their paperback editions are easily obtainable.
Moreover, Jun MIURA proposed outdoor Hannya Shingyo, which is near to pleasure.
Monju Bosatsu, or maJjuzrii in Sanskrit, is one of the Bosatsus which is worshiped in Mahayana Buddhism.
It is said to be a Buddha that controls wisdom.
Monju is an abbreviated name for Monjushuri.
Additionally, it is called Myo Kissho Bosatsu.
Moreover, it is shown in transcript as Manjushiri and is translated as Myokichijo, Myotoku (Myodoku, 妙徳) or Myoshu (妙首).
It is also written as 文珠菩薩.
The Sanmayagyo symbols are the shorenge (a blue tropical water lily), sharp sword and bonkyo (sutras written on coconut leaves).
Shusi (Shuji, Bija) (Mikkyo) is maM.
According to "Monjushuri Nehan-kyo Sutra," it was born in a Brahmin family called Brahmadatta at Tara Juraku, in Sravasti.
Another theory says it was familiar with Shaka's 10 disciples and was related to the editing of Buddhist sutras.
"Yuima-kyo Sutra" described that when nobody could argue with Yuima-koji, who was sick in bed, only Monju Bosatsu, who visited him in place of Shaka, exchanged questions and answers evenly, and this episode highlighted its character as the Bosatsu of wisdom.
Based on this theory, pictures or statues showing the scene in which Monju Bosatsu visited Yuima-koji were produced.
Later, Monju Bosatsu was not seen as a realistic figure as described in "Yuima-kyo Sutra" but gradually became deified through later sutras.
It is said that although it is of the Bosatsu grade in order to benefit Shaka's teaching, once it became Buddha it was called Ryushu-nyorai, Daishin-butsu or Shinsen-butsu and will become Buddha (called Fuken-nyorai) in the future.
In another theory, it exists in the joyful world (常喜世界) in the north at present and is called 歓喜蔵摩尼宝積如来, the name of which can diminish crimes of 四重禁等, or it is said that it lives at Qingliangshan (Wutai Shan Mountain) in Shanxi Province China with 10,000 Bosatsu.
Additionally, according to "Hokkekyo Sutra," after Nichigatsu Tomyo-butsu entered nirvana in the past life, its disciple Myoko Bosatsu was reborn as Monju Bosatsu.
However, these are based on descriptions in Mahayana Sutra; there is no evidence that Monju Bosatsu really existed.
As opposed to Kanzeon Bosatsu and others, it is thought that a real model person existed and that it was the Bosatsu who was created in Buddhist organizations.
Monju Bosatsu is seen in the early Mahayana Sutra, especially in the Prajnaparamita-sutras.
This sutra describes 'Ku (空)' of Hannya in place of Shaka-muni Buddha.
Additionally, many sutras praise Monju Bosatsu as 'Buddha's mother in the three periods,' and in "Kegon-kyo Sutra" it plays an important role to take out Zenzai-doshi on the path to seek Buddhism.
These sutras show that the moral nature of Monju Bosatsu is Hannya (wisdom), which is an important factor in attaining enlightenment.
Moreover, developed from the original aspect of the wisdom to reach enlightenment, it became a symbol of wisdom in general (being smart and having much knowledge), which led to the proverb 'Two heads are better than one' in a later age.
Additionally, in "Feng-Shen-Yen-I," a light novel of China, there appeared mountain hermitscalled Fugen Shinjin and Monju Koho Tenson, who believed Buddhism later and became Fugen Bosatsu and Monju Bosatsu respectively, but this is fiction of a later age.
In China, Mt. Wutai Shan in Shanxi Province has been worshipped widely since ancient times as Qingliangshan, where Monju Bosatsu lives, and this was introduced by Ennin in Japan.
Moreover, in Vol. 29 of "Bussotoki," which is a text of the Chinese Tendai sect, there is the description, 'Monju lives in Zhongnan Shan now and it is a priest Tojun,' which means that Tojun, a founder of the Chinese Kegon sect, was regarded as a reincarnation of Monju Bosatsu.
It is regarded as the principle image of Jianzhou Jurchen (建州女真族) and was identified as Manchuria (Manchus), named after Monju Bosatsu.
After Hung Taiji, Jianzhou Jurchen arrived at the name Manchus instead of Jurchen.
Therefore, the origin of the word Manchuria is assumed to be Monju.
In Japan there is a legend that Gyoki, a priest in the Nara period, was a reincarnation of Monju Bosatsu.
It is one of the kyoji (attendant figures) of Shakanyorai with Fugen Bosatsu (see "Shaka Triad") and is broadly worshiped by itself.
The shapes of Monju Bosatsu statues are nearly identical.
It is in the lotus position on a lion's back with a sharp sword (treasure sword) to symbolize wisdom in the right hand and a shorenge bearing the sutra in the left hand.
In Mikkyo it is shaped as a child with its hair tied in a bun (髻), which conveys a pure mind.
The number of buns can be one, five, six or eight, depending on the statue, and a statue that has one bun is regarded as a principle image in ascetic training for the increase of benefit; the one with five is for adoration, the one with six is for Chobuku (conquest, 調伏) and the one with eight is for safety.
Additionally, the 'Monju quintet' Monju gosonzo was produced, consisting of Monju riding a lion, Zenzai-doshi as an usher, Udenno drawing the reins of the lion, Buddhapali, and the elder Saisho Ronin.
In the Zen sect it is placed as 'Shoso,' which shows the complete figure of an ascetic monk in the monk hall (僧堂) and is shaped as a figure with hair cut engaged in the practice of seated meditation.
In this case, from the viewpoint that Monju is also on the way of ascetic training, it is sometimes called Monji Daishi, which avoids using the title of Bosatsu.
Major works in Japan are the seated statue at Kofuku-ji Temple Tokondo (Eastern Golden Hall) (made by Jokei, a national treasure), Gosonzo at Abe Monju-in Temple (made by Kaikei, an important cultural property) and Gosonzo at Chikurin-ji Temple in Kochi city (an important cultural property).
On Arahasyanou
Taishakuten is one of the Tenbu, deities of Buddhism who reside in a heavenly realm, this being one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another.
It is the war god of Brahmin, Hindu and Zoroastrianism and the same god as Indra that is seen in the clauses of Hittite.
It is also called Shaku Daikanin.
Shaku is Azana, and Daikanin means "most high."
It is often shown as a pair of statues with Bonten (Brahma), a major Hindu deity thought to be responsible for creating the world.
It is the husband of Sachi, a daughter of Ashura.
The name of Taishakuten (帝釈天) originated from Indra's name, Sakro Devanam Indrah, as follows: Sakuro is transliterated to 釈, Devanam is translated freely to 天, and Indrah is translated freely to 帝 and placed first.
Originally, Indra was a war god that fought with Ashura, but it became one of the two good major deities of Buddhism with Bonten after it was incorporated to Buddhism, and it was considered to have helped Shaka before gaining enlightenment and hearing its preaching (see the article on Indra).
It is said that it has some followers such as the Shitenno (four guardian kings) and lives at Zenken-jo Castle atop Mt. Shumisen (the Touriten).
There are Buddhist pictures of Indra, in which Taishakuten, who follows Shaka, has been drawn.
In Vol. 33 of Nehan-kyo Sutra (The Sutra of the Great Nirvana) and Vol. 56 of Daichidoron, there is a description that Taishakuten was called Kyoshika （Kauśika）when he was a human.
In ancient times, in Mahadh there was a Brahmin whose first name was Maka and family name was Kyoshika, and who did good deeds (福徳) and had great wisdom.
He had 32 acquaintances and friends with whom to learn and do good deeds, and after death he was reborn in the second world above on the top of Mt. Shumisen.
Maka Brahmin became most high, and 32 acquaintances and friends became ministers to give advice so that 33 (including him) are called the 33 Ten.
For this reason Shaka Buddha calls him Kyoshika, his true name.
Moreover, his wife Sachi is in some cases called Mrs. Kyoshika.
In Japan it is often expressed as a statue with two upper arms (二臂像), its hair tied in a treasure bun (宝髻) atop the head, and dressed in Chinese formal clothes.
In some cases he wears armor under the clothes and has a kongosho or a lotus root in his hand.
In Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) there are some examples in which he has one face and two upper arms (一面二臂) with a crown on the head, armor on the body and a tokkosho, a pestle with a single sharp blade at each end--this being considered an attribute of Buddhist guardian figures as well as a symbolic item of Esoteric Buddhism--in his hand.
The other figure depicts him riding a white elephant.
The oldest work in Japan is seen in 'the picture of Seshin Monge, giving up the body to hear a verse of scripture,' drawn on Tamamushi no zushi, the Beetle Wing Shrine, (Asuka period) at Horyu-ji Temple.
At Jiki-do in Horyu-ji Temple were placed statues of Bonten and Taishakuten (Nara period) (currently placed at Dai-Hozo-In (Great Treasure Gallery).
At Hoke-do (Sangatsudo) in Todai-ji Temple there are statues of Bonten and Taishakuten of kanshitsu-zukuri, done in the dry lacquer technique (Nara period).
At Toshodai-ji Temple Kondo there are wooden statues of Bonten and Taishakuten (Nara period).
At the Toji Lecture Hall, in Kyoto, there is a wooden statue on a white elephant, which is characteristic of Mikkyo.（first stage of the Heian period)
In Japan, Ennichi (Hoping) is held on Koshin Day.
For an example of the temple where Taishakuten is enshrined, Shibamata Taishakuten (Daikyo-ji Temple) in Tokyo's Katsushika Ward, has been made famous by the movie "Otoko Wa Tsurai Yo (It's Tough Being a Man)."
Since the lost Ita-honzon (wooden main deity) of Taishakuten was discovered during the restoration of the main hall of Daikyo-ji Temple one Koshin Day in the latter half of the eighteenth century, Ennichi became to be held on Koshin Day (for details, see "Shibamata Taishakuten").
In the Dankun myth, which originated in the Goryeo period of Korea, Dankun, a founder of Dankun (Korea) is regarded as a son who was born from Kanyu, a bastard child of Taishakuten (Kanin in 'Sangokuiji'), and a woman that had humanized from a female bear.
Yakushi Nyorai, bhaiSajya-guru in Sanskrit, is a Nyorai of Mahayana Buddhism.
It is also called Yakushi Ｒuriko Ｎyorai or Daiiobutsu.
Its Sanma yagyo (characteristic of the Buddha) is a medicine vase or a bowl containing pills.
Its shuji (characteristic one syllable word) (Esoteric Buddhism) (shuji) is bhai, the initials of its name.
Representative Buddhist scriptures that preach 'Yakushi Nyorai are Yakushi ruriko nyorai hongan kudokukyo (Yakushikyo),' which was translated by Genjo, and 'Yakushi ruriko shichibutsu hongan kudokukyo (Shichibutsu yakushikyo),' which was translated by Gijo.
According to Yakushi hongan kudokukyo, Yakushi Nyorai was a founder of a religious sect in Toho joruri sekai (Eastern Pure Land), and swore 12 oaths when it was Bodhisattva, lengthened people's lives by curing their diseases, removed disasters, provided clothes and food, practiced Buddhist ascetic training and finally became Buddha by attaining Mujo bodai (perfect Buddhist enlightenment).
Yakushi Nyorai is believed to cure people's diseases by Ruriko (lazuline light).
Unlike other Nyorai, it is the target of worship seeking worldly interests since it is the buddha of medicine which provides medicine to cure avidya disease.
It is a Nyorai of exoteric Buddhism and the Japanese Shingon Sect (Shingon Esoteric Buddhism) basically does not emphasize it.
Although it is often treated as chuson (the center statue of three or more statues) in Besson mandara (Mandara of individual deities) of Zo-mitsu (the Mixed Esoteric Buddhism), it doesn't appear in Ryokai mandara (Mandara of the two Realms) of Jun-mitsu (The Pure Esoteric Buddhism).
However, in the Tendai Sect (Tendai Esoteric Buddhism) which traditionally had close ties with the Emperor's family, it was sometimes linked with the Emperor, a king of the eastern country, because it was the founder of a religious sect in Toho joruri sekai.
Being an eastern Nyorai, he is also regarded as the same Nyorai as Ashuku Nyorai.
Further, there exist views that assert it is the same Nyorai as Dainichi Nyorai and such views derive from the interpretation by Tendai Esoteric Buddhism that Shaka Nyorai of Kuon-jitsujo, advocated in Lotus Sutra of exoteric Buddhism, coincides with Dainichi Nyorai of Esoteric Buddhism or Shaka Nyorai appears in the shape of Dainichi Nyorai in order to save people.
As for the statue form, there exist both standing statues and seated statues and normally, their right hands make semui in (mudra for bestowing fearlessness), while the left hands make yogan in (wish-granting mudra) and hold a medicine vase.
However, many statues produced in ancient Japan, such as the statue in the main hall of the Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara and the statue in the main hall of the Toshodai-ji Temple in Nara, don't hold a medicine vase.
It is believed that the production of statues holding a medicine vase started after the introduction of 'Yakushi Nyorai nenju giki' translated by Fuku.
Yakushi Nyorai is enshrined not only as a single statue but also as Yakushi Sanzonzo (three statues) with Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu situated on both sides.
The statue of Juni Jinsho (the twelve divine generals) is often enshrined together as the followers of Yakushi Nyorai.
In the halo of Yakushi Nyorai, 6 or 7 statues of the same size are situated.
They are called Shichibutsu Yakushi (to be mentioned afterward) and believed to be Yakushi Nyorai and its avatars.
Temple festival of Yakushi Nyorai is held on the 8th of each month.
The above practice is believed to have derived from 'Yakushiko' (religious meeting of worshipping Yakushi Nyorai) at which people learnt and praised the virtue of Yakushi Nyorai.
Most Kokubun-ji Temples enshrine Yakushi Nyorai as their principal image.
In 'Yakushi ruriko shichibutsu hongan kudokukyo (Shichibutsu Yakushikyo)' translated by Gijo and 'Yakushi Nyorai hongankyo' translated by Daruma Gyuta, original vows and bukkokudo (the land that Buddha has purified) of Shichibutsu, including Yakushi Nyorai, are advocated.
Tendai Esoteric Buddhism emphasized Shichibutsu Yakushi ho (praying to the seven Yakushi Nyorai), which was believed to have originated by Ennin, as the one which brings about health and safe delivery, and prayer for safe delivery using Shichibutsu Yakushi ho was conducted at the Fujiwara sekkanke (the families which produced regents) in the 8th -9th century.

In Japan where a creed seeking worldly interests was prevalent among people, Yakushi Nyorai scriptures were often produced for the purpose of praying for the healing of diseases.
Along with Amida Nyorai which promises peaceful death, Yakushi Nyorai attracted the most worshippers in Japan.
Although the year of 607 is seen in the halo of the seated statue of Yakushi Nyorai enshrined at the main hall of the Horyu-ji Temple in Nara, it is said, judging from the terms used in its inscription and casting technology employed in the production of the statue, that it was actually produced in the late 7th century.
Further, as it is the rare Nyorai that presides over worldly interests, many typical (in charge of praying to defend and maintain the nation) Esoteric Buddhism temples, such as Enryaku-ji Temple, Jingo-ji Temple, To-ji Temple and Kanei-ji Temple, enshrine Yakushi Nyorai as their principal image.
(As there are a lot of statues, only those that are famous from the viewpoint of Buddhist sculpture history and those designated as national treasure are listed.)
The statue at the Shojo-ji Temple in Fukushima (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Ninna-ji Temple (the former Kita-in) in Kyoto (a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Jingo-ji Temple in Kyoto (a standing statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at Yakushido of the Daigo-ji Temple (Kami Daigo) in Kyoto (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Shishikutsu-ji Temple in Osaka (a seated statue, the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the main hall of the Horyu-ji Temple in Nara (a seated statue, from the Asuka period to the Nara period, a national treasure)
The statue at the lecture hall of the Horyu-ji Temple in Nara (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the middle of the Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the main hall of the Toshodai-ji Temple in Nara (a standing statue, from the Nara period to the early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (the center statue of Yakushi Sanzon, a seated statue, the Nara period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Shin Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (seated statue, early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at Nara National Museum (seated statue, early Heian period, a national treasure)
The statue at the Ganko-ji Temple in Nara (Shibanoshinya-cho, Nara City) (standing statue, early Heian period, a national treasure)
In the Tokugawa period, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, the first Shogun, was deified and was called shinkun.
Thanks to the work of Buddhist monk Tenkai, Ieyasu was given the posthumous name of 'Tosho Daigongen' by the imperial court and was enshrined at the Toshogu Shrine.
This is the origin of the faith in Tosho Gongen.
This faith is the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism and according to it, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA is assumed as the temporary figure of Yakushi Nyorai who appeared in Japan while religious service is conducted in the way of Jinja Shinto.
As Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was believed to have been born after his mother, Odai no kata, prayed to Yakushi Nyorai enshrined at the Horai-ji Temple (Shinshiro City, Aichi Prefecture) as its principal image, it is also said that Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was the reincarnation of Yakushi Nyorai, a principal image of the Horai-ji Temple, who appeared in the human world.
As for the mantra of Yakushi Nyorai, its shoshu is 'on korokoro sendari matougi sowaka' and it coincides with that of Muno Shomyoo.
Its taishu is 'noumo bagyabatei baiseija kuro beiruria haraba arajaya tatagyataya arakatei sanmyakusanbodaya taniyata on baiseizei baiseizei sanborigyatei sowaka' and it appears in Yakusi hongan kudokukyo.
Yakushi Nyorai's shoshu has the meaning which reflects primitive Indian or Asian customs.
The translation of this shoshu is 'omu (sacred voice), remove, Candari, Matangi, achieve (subaha)'.
Remove' means removing plague and Candari and Matangi are the female names of a clan that was engaged in slaughter work, but originally they were the names of goddesses that were worshipped by people of lower class.
Original meaning of 'subaha' is an offering to be thrown into the festival fire.
Later, it was deified as the wife of Agni, the god of fire, and became a yell to be used when praying for the achievement of hope while making an offering.
Upper class people despised Candari and Matangi or regarded them as dangerous as the goddesses that were worshipped by dirty people.
However, it was generally believed that people were able to escape from plagues presided by such a goddess by daring to pray to them.
In terms of the concept of escaping from plague by chanting mantra to aragami which causes such plague, it has a similar nature with 'Somin shorai' in Japan.
Juni Shinsho (the 12 protective deities) are tenbu, deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another; they are worshiped and shaped into statues in Buddhism, and are good deities that guard Buddhism.
They are also called Juni Yashataisho or Juni Shinmyoo and comprise 12 war gods who guard people who believe in the Yakushi-nyorai and Yakushi-kyo sutra.
It is said that the Juni Shinsho guard each 12 hours of the day and night in accordance with the 12 wishes of Yakushi-nyorai.
For this reason the zodiac is applied.
Each protective deity heads each of 7,000 attendants, covering a total of 84,000 Yasha, i.e., a class of semi-divine being usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified together with malignant spirits.
Above their heads are often placed signs modeled after the animals of the zodiac.
In Japan the life-size statue of Juni Shinsho at Shin-Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara is the oldest, and it is famous for its excellence of form.
Additionally, the Juni Shinsho have each principal image of Buddha such as Buddha, Bosatsu and Myoo.
Each name and its corresponding principal image of Buddha and the zodiac follows (although there are a few differences in the letters and sounds, depending on the sutras, but the following names are commonly used).
Although the 12 deities' belongings and poses are not necessarily unified, it is nearly impossible to distinguish them only by characters depicted in pictures and statues.
In China the statue of Juni Shinsho had been produced in early times, and there is an example of wall painting in Dunhuang City.
In China they have been worshiped in association with the zodiac, and many works in Japan also depict animals of the zodiac above their heads.
In Japan many statues such as the statue of Shin-Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (eighth century) in the Nara period have been produced.
In many cases, at the Buddhist halls where Yakushi-nyorai is placed as the principle image of Buddha, each of six deities is placed on the left and right side of Yakushi-nyorai, or in a line ahead of the Buddhist altar.
There are various ways of expression; in one case they are placed around a circular Buddhist altar such as the statues of Shin-Yakushi-ji Temple, and in another case they form a halo or a foundation of the statue of Yakushi-nyorai.
They are shown as war gods, the same as the statues of the Shitenno (four guardian kings), and in many works each of twelve characters is distinguished by its facial expression or pose, and they vary widely as a group.

Additionally, as opposed to the above Buddhist scriptures, Juni Tensho, which is used in Rikujinshinka, one of the mantic or shikisen in Onmyo-do, is sometimes incorrectly called Juni Shinsyo.
In 'Junisho Shoshuhodaiyon,' the fourth chapter of Senjiryakketsu, written by ABE no Seimei, a famous master of Onmyo-do, things that Juni Tensyo reveal are explained as follows:

Bishamonten (vaizravaNa in Sanskrit) is a Buddha of the Tenbu, deities who reside in a heavenly realm, this being one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another, in Buddhism.
It is a war god and one of the Shitenno (four guardian kings) with Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra), Zochoten (Virudhaka) and Komokuten (Virupaksa).
Additionally, it is not only one of the shitenno but is worshiped individually over a broad region, such as Central Asia and China (other than in Japan).
Its predecessor is Kubera, a treasure god in Indian myth.
The title of vaizravaNa originally meant 'the son of vizravas,' so it originated from his father's name, but it can be interpreted as 'a man who listens very well' so that it is also translated as Tamonten.
In Japan, when it is shaped as a statue and placed as one of the Shitenno it is usually called 'Tamonten,' but when in the form of a statue and placed individually it is usually called 'Bishamonten.'
The Sanmayagyo symbol is a treasure club (a club with which to defeat the enemy of Buddhism in order to protect the Buddhist dharma) as well as a pagoda.
Shushi (Shuji, Bija) in Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) is vai.
The mantra (shingon) for Bishamonten is 'On Beishiramanayasowaka (oM vaizravaNaaya svaahaa, that is, om (saintly sound), the son of vizravas, svaahaa), etc.
Although there are various figures (as below), in Japan it is generally expressed as a warrior figure of the Tang dynasty that dons leather armor.
Its belongings generally consist of a pagoda.
Moreover, it often stands on an ogre called Jaki (邪鬼).
For example, in the Ryokai Mandala (Mandala of the Two Realms) of Mikkyo, it is drawn as a figure that has a treasure club in the right hand and a pagoda in the left hand and is wearing armor.
However, the Shitenno statue in Todai-ji Temple Kaidan-do is shaped as a figure that has a pagoda in the right hand and a treasure club in the left hand.
(The statue in Nara Taima-dera Temple has a pagoda in the right hand as well.)
In India, it was considered as a treasure god and was hardly depicted as a warrior.
As to the character in this age, see the article on Kubera.
During the process that was transmitted to China through Central Asia, the faith as a war god was created and it came to be a guardian deity as one of the Shitenno.
Additionally, as a following of Taishakuten it is said to live in Tengyo-jo Castle of Suishota, which is the north of Mt. Shumisen (Mt. Sumeru) or to guard Hokkurushu (uttara-kuru), one of the four continents in the world view of ancient India.
Moreover, it subordinates devils such as Yasha (a class of semi-divinity that is usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but is sometimes also classified with malignant spirits) and Rasetsu (Rakshasa).
Additionally, in Mikkyo it is one of the juniten (十二天) and is said to guard the north.
In Japan it is one of the seven deities of good luck as a unique faith and is revered because it seems to benefit games especially.
Figure of image
There is no clear rule regarding Bisyamonten's figure, so that various expressions exist.
It is expressed as the figure of a warrior in Japan as mentioned above, and generally it has a pagoda.
There is another work that has a trident: for example, the statue at Mimuroto-ji Temple in Kyoto does not have a pagoda but a trident in one hand and places the other hand on his hip.
In the folk faith of China it is expressed as a figure that has a green face with an umbrella in the right hand and a silver mouse in the left hand.
In Tibetan Buddhism it is expressed as a figure that has a mongoose who disgorges gold, silver and jewels, thus maintaining the character of a treasure god in India.
There are many works as an individual deity or the central deity.
The styles of placement are as follows: a triad style in which Bishamonten is placed at the center with Kyoji (attendant figures) of Kisshoten (Kichijoten, Sri-mahadevi, who is said to a wife of the sister of Bishamonten) and Zennishi-doji (who is said to be a son of Bishamonten) (Kurama Temple in Kyoto, Sekkei-ji Temple in Kochi, and so on); a style that places a pair of Bishamonten with Kisshoten (the statue of Horyuji Temple Kondo (法隆寺金堂) in Nara); and a style that places a pair of Bishamonten with Fudo Myoo (the statue of Koyasan Kongobuji Temple and so on).
Additionally, in the temples of the Tendai sect it is often seen that Senju Kannon is placed at the center and Bishamonten and Fudo Myoo are placed at its sides (Myoo-in Temple in Shiga, Bujo-ji Temple in Kyoto).
There are many works of Tamonten statues that guard the north (the back of the dais for a Buddhist image on the observer's right) as being among the Shitenno.
The figure is nearly the same as an individual Bishamonten statue but often has a pagoda in one hand.
Designated works from the nation are Tamonten statues among the Shitenno statues at Todai-ji Temple Kaidan-do, Joruri-ji Temple in Kyoto, Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara.
Derived figures
Takutori-tenno
In China it was mixed with Risei (Li Jing), a warrior at the beginning of the Tang who was respected as a war god, which led to the creation of the god Takutori-tenno.
This Takutori-tenno is today thought of as a god other than Tamonten among the Shitenno and as a kind of shogun of gods who led the Shitenno, including Tamonten.
Later, it became to be revered in Dokyo as well.
This is Takutori-tenno, described as father of Nata-taishi in "Journey to West" and Risei in Feng-Shen-Yen-I.
As mentioned above, while Tamonten of the Shitenno is shown as a figure that has an umbrella, Takutori-tenno is shown as a warrior figure that has a pagoda.
This succeeds the old figure of Bishamonten, which was shaped during the Tang dynasty.
Tobatsu Bishamonten
There is a particular figure of statue which is called Tobatsu Bishamonten.
It wears armor knitted from chains (Kinsako (金鎖甲), and protective gear called Ebigote (海老籠手) over the arms, as well as a coronet on the head.
Its belongings are a pagoda in the left hand and a treasure club or ji in the right hand, which is clearly exotic.
Additionally, it stands on Chitennyo and two devils (Niranba and Biranba) instead of Jaki.
It is said that Tobatsu Bishamonten in To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple) was placed on Rajomon gate.
It is generally said that 'Tobatsu (兜跋)' means Western 兜跋 country (Turfan at present), which is based on a legend that Bishamonten appeared in this place with this figure.
Other characters of '刀抜' or '屠半' are used in some cases.
The figures of statues are clarified into two: the one that faithfully emulates the statue of To-ji Temple (the statue of Nara National Museum, the statue of Seiryo-ji Temple in Kyoto) and the other, which is nearly the same as the usual Bishamonten statue except that it stands on both hands of Chitennyo (Narushima Bishamon-do in Iwate, etc.).
"Monzeki" or "Monseki" means the formal successor of the founder of a Buddhist sect in Japan.
It means 'Monyo Monryu.'
It is also called Monshu.
Since the Kamakura period it has come to mean the high-class temple itself, or in other words the status of the temple, and those temples have come to be called Monzeki temples.
It was in the beginning that Emperor Uda became priest and lived in Ninna-ji Temple (therefore called Omuro-gosho), and came to be called Omuro-Monzeki.
Since around the beginning of the Kamakura period, children of the Imperial Family and the sekke (the line of regents and advisers) came to be priests at specific temples.
The children had a Shoen (i.e. a manor) and came to take control of accepted temples by political power due to their economic power so that they ultimately came to succeed each monryu.
This became a custom, and soon 'Monzeki' itself was changed to mean the title of the specific temples to which people from the 'nobility' succeeded.
During the Muromachi period, 'Monzeki,' as the status of a temple, was established so that the post of Monzeki bugyo (shogunate administrator, 門跡奉行) to govern Monzeki temples was assigned by the Muromachi shogunate.
Additionally, the Edo shogunate institutionalized the monzeki through the clarification of miya-monzeki (temples headed by imperial princes, 宮門跡), sekke-monzeki (temples headed by the sekke families, 摂家門跡), seiga-monzeki (temples headed by the seiga families, 清華門跡), kubo-monzeki (公方門跡) or buke-monzki (武家門跡, temples headed by military families), jun-monzeki (准門跡) or waki-monzeki (脇門跡), etc.

They are also called the thirteen monzeki.
In fact, only the Imperial Prince could enter the three monzeki of Rinno-ji Temple, Ninna-ko Temple and Daikaku-ji Temple, while children from the sekke could enter the other monzeki.
This word has been used since around the Muromachi period, and children from the sekke became chief priests.
It was not an inherent title of each monzeki temple but instead indicated the descent of the chief priest.
Temples of a status second to Monzeki
Or, a monzeki temple that is subordinate to the other one
It is also called "Waki Monzeki."

The sect Hong gwan-ji-ha is one of the Jodo Shinshu sects.
The head temple is Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple, which began from Otani Byodo (the present Otani Mausoleum), a grave of Shinran, the founder of the sect.
The branch temples number 10,497.
The believers number approximately 6,940,000, which is the largest among Jodo Shinshu sects (Shinshu sects) and among Buddhist religious corporations as well.
Among religious corporations as a whole, it is the second largest after Jinja-Honcho, the Association of Shinto Shrines.
(As of December 31, 2000)
At the beginning of the Meiji period, it had a governmental system of legislative process (shukai) and administration (shumusho), thus emulating the system of separation of the powers in Western countries.
This became a model for the Meiji government in establishing a legislative system.
The twenty-second Kozui OTANI, a monshu (Honganji-ha head priest) who had great power, made efforts to send an Otani exploration party to engage in missionary work abroad and educate students, but the cost brought Hongwan-ji Temple's finances to the point of crisis, so Kyonyo was forced to retire.
In order to avoid another crisis, Hongwan-ji-ha deemed it necessary to limit the power of the monshu (the Otani family).
The Otani family changed its status from the center of power to a symbol.
Monshu is the chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple and a person who 'succeeds the light of Buddhism integrates this sect and directs duties (宗務)' (Article 6 of the sect law), and the representative of religious cooperation is Shumu-socho, who is elected at the shukai (representative assembly) (among Shinshu sects, but only Hongwan-ji-ha calls it socho).
It was in 1877 when the name of the sect was formally established as the Jodo Shinshu sect Hongwan-ji-ha.
It is called 'Onishi-san' in order to distinguish it from the Shinshu sect Otani-ha ('Ohigashi-san').
The head temple, Hongwan-ji Temple, is also called 'Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple' generally or is called 'Hompa Hongwan-ji Temple' in the sense of Hongwan-ji-ha.
The Shinshu sect Otani-ha is one of the groups of Jodo Shinshu sect.
The head temple is Higashi-Hongwan-ji Temple, at Rokujo Karasuma in Kyoto.
The number of branch temples is 9,804.
In order to distinguish it from the Jodo Shinshu sect Hongwan-ji-ha (commonly called 'Onishi-san,' 'Hompa' or 'Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple'), it is called 'Ohigashi-san,' 'O-ha' 'Tani-ha' and so on.
Shin-shu Honbyo, the head temple, is commonly called 'Higashi-Hongwan-ji Temple' after the split of the east and west for the same reason.
This summary extracts and cites the "Religious Corporation 'Shinshu Sect Otani-ha' Rules," which are made public based on the Religious Corporation Act, and the "Shinshu Sect Otani-ha Shuken (Constitution of Sect, 宗憲) ("Shuken" in the following), which is defined as the supreme rule in its Article 3.
The core principles of sect management are as follows:
(Source: the preceding sentence on Shuken)
Continuous practice of the Doho society (同朋社会)
All people who believe in the sect make efforts to review the teachings of the Jodo Shinshu sect, by each person constantly, and confirm it with others, and continuously practice the social life toward attainment of the Buddhist paradise of Amitabha Buddha.
Combination of the sect and the mausoleum
The Shin-shu Honbyo (mausoleum) in which a picture of the sect's founder Shinran is placed, is an important place for all followers of the sect to confirm the teachings on which they depend, so that all followers of the sect have to revere and guard this, being combined equally with the doctrine.
Open discussion by Doho
The management of the sect is based on open discussions by all Doho (followers) without permitting anyone's tyranny.
Shuken' is the supreme law of Otani-ha.
(Source: Chapter 1, Article 5 of Shuken)
The main doctrine is Ogen Ni-eko (Oso-eko・Genso-eko), as constituted from the name of Hongwan (by Amidanyorai), which was extracted from Kenjodoshinjitsukyogyoshomonrui (Kyogyoshinsho) based on Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra by the founder of the sect, St. Shinran.

Moreover, in order to express gratitude for the prevalence of the true dharma (正法), the pictures of Shinran, the founder of the sect, Prince Shotoku, seven high priests and successive monshus (Hongwan-ji-ha head priests) are placed.

Following the above basic principles, various types of missionary work, social activities and projects are implemented.
Actual management is currently implemented by the central and local organizations (30 parishes in Japan and three parishes abroad (開教区), with 420 groups (So (組)) in those parishes).
In each organization a system for the separation of the powers is adopted as follows:
Central organization
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): Shukai (bicameral legislature of Shu-gikai (representative of priests elected from each parish, 宗議会) and San-gikai (representative of lay followers elected from each parish, 参議会))
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): executive bodies to implement religious activities such as Naikyoku (内局) (consisting of Shumu-socho, who is appointed at Shukai and is a representative director of the Religious Corporation Shinshu sect Otani-ha, and five sanmus (参務) appointed from Shumu-socho), Shumusyo (in the center), Kyomusho (a local branch in each parish, 教務所), and Kaikyo Kantokubu (a branch in each overseas parish, 開教監督部)
The organization that corresponds to judicial branch (a body for investigation): Shinmonin (審問院) (headed by Shinmonincho, who is appointed by Naikyoku with the consent of Shu-gikai)
Local organization (parish)
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): parish association (教区会) (representative of priests elected from each So) and parish lay followers association (教区門徒会) (representatives of lay followers elected by each So).
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): the committee of missionary work in parish (its chairman is the head of Kyomusho） and administrators of Shumu who reside in Kyomusho
The organization that corresponds to the judicial branch (a body for investigation): committee of inspectors
Local organizations (So(組))
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): So-kai (組会) (responsible official of each temple and church (representatives of priests in each temple and church) and So-Monto-kai (組門徒会) (representatives of lay followers in each temple and church)
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): disciplinary board of the So (its chairman is the head of the So, elected at the So-kai)
The organization that corresponds to the judicial branch (an investigative body): inspection committee
*Fifty-six branch temples are placed as a base for missionary work (聞信・宣布) in each domestic and overseas parish other than the above organizations.
Additionally, as a representative of priests and lay followers in the above organizations, Monshu, the Hongwan-ji-ha head priest, has been assigned and has been in charge of guarding the picture of Shinran, the founder of the sect, at Shinshu Hombyo, and reveres Buddha as a symbol of the sect, which believes the Shinshu sect teachings with other Doho (the present Monshu is the twenty-fifth Jonyo, Choken OTANI).
Additionally, although it is often confused, the Jodo Shinshu sect Higashi-Hongwan-ji-ha of which Head Temple is Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple in Taito Ward, Tokyo (the number of branch temples is 300 and several tens) defected and became independent from the Shinshu sect Otani-ha in 1981, because of the difference in the way of the sect, so currently they are different religious corporations (see "Ohigashi Turmoil (お東騒動)").
The religious community centered at Hongwan-ji Temple was originally one group, but at the beginning of the Edo period it was split into Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple's group and Nishi-Hongwan-ji Temple's group, which continue to this day.
The split of the Hongwan-ji Temple religious community into east and west originated from the difference of opinion within the community at the end of the Ikko Ikki (Ishiyama War) (1570-1580), which was fought around Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple at the end of the Age of Civil War.
Within the Hongwan-ji Temple religious community at the end of the Ishiyama War, there existed two opinions: the former was an opinion to support peace-making with the hostile Nobunaga ODA, and the latter was an opinion to insist on do-or-die resistance.
The eleventh Kennyo, who was the monshu of Hongwan-ji Temple at that time, withdrew Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple with the group that supported overall peace, but Kyonyo, the eldest son of Kennyo, temporarily stayed at Ishiyama with the group that supported do-or-die resistance and solicited support for the resistance group even after withdrawal.
This situation of a split in the religious community continued after Hongwan-ji Temple returned to Kyoto in 1591, having been given land for a temple (Nanajo Horikawa) by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.
Ieyasu TOKUGAWA focused attention on this and gave land to the east of Hongwan-ji Temple (Rokujo Karasuma) to Kyonyo in 1602, aiming for the deconcentration of the power of Hongwan-ji Temple, which was the largest religious group (Ieyasu had suffered through the Ikko Ikki when he was a lord of Mikawa Province and felt seriously threatened by the power of Hongwan-ji Temple).
Consequently, Hongwan-ji Temple split into Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple of which the twelfth monshu was Junnyo, the third son of Kennyo, (the present Jodo Shinshu sect Hongwan-ji-ha) and Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple of which the twelfth monshu was Kyonyo, the eldest son of Kennyo (the present Shinshu sect Otani-ha).
(*For the above, see the articles on the Jodo Shinshu sect and the history of Hongwan-ji Temple.)
It is said that such a situation reflects the above historical process because, while there are many branch temples and lay followers of Hongwan-ji-ha (Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple), especially in the Chugoku district (which is called 'Aki-monto' and so on), there are many branch temples and lay followers in the Hokuriku and Tokai districts, as seen in the location of branch temples and parishes (which are called 'Kaga-monto,' 'Owari-monto,' 'Mikawa-monto' and so on).
The founder, Shinran (1173-1262): Defined as 'the founder (the first chief priest) by Kakunyo, the third chief priest).
Kakushinni (1224?-1283?): Reburied Shinran's stone pagoda from Otani to Yoshimizu in 1272 and built Otani Mausoleum.
In 1277 she assumed the first Rusushiki (until 1283).
The second chief priest, Nyoshin (1235-1300): delegated the light of Buddhism in 1280.
(He delegated office work to Kakushinni and Kakue.)
He was defined as 'the second chief priest' by Kakunyo, the third chief priest.
Kakue (1239?-1307): Succeeded from Rusushiki in 1283 (until 1307).
*'The incident of Yuizen': Turmoil over the installation of Rusushiki between Kakue and Yuizen.
After Kakue's death, it was settled by the adjudication of Shorenin on July in 1309.
The third chief priest, Kakunyo (1270-1351): succeeded Rusushiki of Otani Mausoleum with the approval of lay followers in Eastern provinces in 1310.
(- 1314, 1322- 1338, 1342-1350) (repeated transfer and reinstatement)
*in 1321 he turned Otani Mausoleum into a temple, which became 'Hongwan-ji Temple.'
(In 1312 he put up the framework of 'Senju-ji Temple' but it was removed by Eizan's opposition.)
*In 1331 he wrote "Kuden-sho," expressed 'Ketimyaku (Lineage Through Blood, 血脈"), which is kept among three generations, and insisted on succeeding the light of Buddhism.
(Lineage of dharma (法脈): Honen⇒Shinran⇒Nyoshin⇒Kakunyo, lineage through blood: Shinran⇒Kakushinni⇒Kakue⇒Kakunyo)
Zonkaku (1290-1373): Succeeded from Rusushiki in 1314
(-1322, 1338-1342 (repeated removal and reinstatement by Kakunyo)
*In 1350 he was reconciled with Kakunyo.
He delegated the status of Hongwan-ji Betto (a status including the chief priest of the temple into Rusushiki) to Zennyo.
The fourth chief priest, Zennyo (1333-1389): Succeeded in 1350
The fifth chief priest, Shakunyo (1350-1393): Succeeded in 1390
(Soon after succession, he delegated the temple's office work to Konyo.)
The sixth chief priest, Konyo (1376-1440): Became the successor in 1394
The seventh chief priest, Zonyo (1396-1457)
The eighth chief priest, Rennyo (1415-1499): Passed over in 1489
The ninth chief priest, Jitsunyo (1458-1525)
The tenth chief priest, Shonyo (1516-1554)

The thirteenth chief priest, Sennyo (1604-1658)
The fourteenth chief priest, Takunyo (1625-1671): passed over in 1664.

The twenty-fourth chief priest, Kocho OTANI (1903-1993): passed over in 1993 with his entering nirvana.
From 1993 to 1996, due to the chaos caused by the Ohigasi Turmoil, monshu had been absent and Ennei OTANI Kagiyaku (1914-2008) had been put in charge as an alternate monshu.
The twenty-fifth chief priest, Choken OTANI (1930-): Succeeded in 1996
The Present Monshu
Reference: Shinshu Otani-ha Techo (published by Shinshu Otani-ha Shumusho Shuppanbu)
In order to communicate with government and other central institutions and to adjust policies in the capital, the Tokyo Local office was established.
(Chapter 6, Section 4, Article 59 of Shuken)
In order to manage local missionary work, the entire national territory was parochialized and Kyomusho was established in each parish.
(Source: Chapter 6, Section 5, Article 60 of Shuken)
Additionally, Otani-ha established a regional parish system (連区制), aiming to establish partnership with each parish on a regional scale in Japan and to promote missionary work more in each area.
There are five regional parishes of 'Hokkaido prefecture: 'Tohoku,' 'Hokuriku,' 'Tokai,' 'Kinki' and 'Kyushu.'
Branch temples are placed under the control of domestic parishes or overseas parishes.
(Source: Chapter 6, Section 5, Article 61 of Shuken)
A chief priest is appointed at a branch temple, and Monshu is in charge of this.
However, a person other than Monshu can become a chief priest.
(Chapter 7, Article 73 of Shuken)
A Rinban (輪番) is appointed at a branch temple.
A Rinban carries out for the work of chief priest and is a representative director of branch temple as a religious corporation.
(Chapter 7, Article 74 of Shuken)
Fifty-six temples exist as branch temples of the Shinshu sect Otani-ha as shown below, and the way of their establishment is as follows:
The case of establishment at an historical site of the founder of the sect or the successive monshu, or at venerable lands.
The case of establishment as the basis for the missionary work of each area
The case of establishment through a combination of the reasons mentioned above
Although there is a regional disproportion, it is placed nearly all over Japan (along with three overseas) and plays a role as a base of missionary work in each place.
Being greatly different from other traditional Buddhist sects, which interpret the concept of missionary work broadly and have no direct relationship with political movements as organizations, it conducts in-depth activities socially and politically with other Shinshu sects, so that there is such a criticism from inside and outside the sect, as it is too active in movements of a political and/or leftist nature.
Additionally, some priests and voluntary groups of followers are concerned with and see it as a problem that the activities of Otani-ha and Shinshu Kyodan Rengo consisting of ten groups of Shinshu sects (including Otani-ha) seem to incline toward the left.
Fudo Myoo (acala naatha in Sanskrit) is a subject of worship in Buddhism and one of the Myoo, a venerable status (尊格) that is specific to Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism.
It is also the Myoo that is the center of Godai Myoo (the five great myoo).
It is regarded as an incarnation of Dainichinyorai, which is the essential Buddha of Mikkyo, or an expression that shows its inner determination.
It has become popular as the name of 'Ofudo-san' and is called Dainichi Daisho Fudo Myoo, Mudo Myoo, Mudo-son, Fudo-son and so on.
Among Buddhist countries in Asia, it is believed with particular fervor in Japan, as exemplified by the numerous statues.
Moreover, Fudo Myoo is depicted on the Nichiren sect's main image (which is called Jikkai Mandala), and has been drawn by Shushi (Shuji, Bija) historically since Nichiren because it's a venerable status of Mikkyo, which was transmitted by Kukai, as well as Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja).
Moreover, it is said that Fudo Myoo in Nichiren's mandala shows that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana, while Aizen Myoo shows that the idea that earthly desires are a pure aspiration to enlightenment.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a sharp sword and kenjaku (kensaku, kenzaku) with a rope made from five different colored strands (blue, yellow, red, black and white).
Shushi (Mikkyo) (Shuji) is haaM or hmmaaM.
Mantra, Shingon, is used 'Noumaku Sanmanda Bazaradan Kan (namaH samanta vajraaNaaM haaM),' which is generally called Shoshu (小咒) or Ichiji-shu (一字咒).
Additionally, the Mantra 'Noumaku Sarabatatagyateibyaku Sarababokkeibyaku Sarabatatarata Sendamakaroshada Kengyakigyaki Sarababiginan Untarata Kanman (namaH sarvatathaagatebhyaH sarvamukhebhyaH, sarvathaa traT caNDamahaaroSaNa khaM khaahi khaahi sarvavighanaM huuM traT haaM maaM),' which is called Taichu (大咒) or Kakaishu (火界咒), and 'Noumaku Sanmanda Basaradan Sendanmakaroshadaya Sohatara Untarata Kanman (namaH samanta vajraaNaaM, caNDamahaaroSaNa sphoTaya huuM traT haaM maaM),' which is called Chushu (中咒) or Jiku-shu (慈救咒), are known.
Acala' in Sanskrit means 'unshakable' and 'naatha' means 'guardian,' so that as a whole it means 'unshakable guardian.'
In Tibetan Buddhism it is known more as Chanda Maharosha (caNDamahaaroSaNa), which is a fierce prickly god (暴悪忿怒尊), in comparison to this name.
However, this is shown as a figure having three eyes with wearing a fur coat and having its hair stand on end, so that it is to some extent different from the Fudo Myoo transmitted to Japan in the context of iconography.
It is said that the iconography of Fudo Myoo was introduced to Japan when Kobo-daishi Kukai transmitted Mikkyo from China.
The sacred name of 'Fudo' was seen for the first time as 'Fudo messenger' in 'Fukukenjaku Jimpen Shingonkyo Sutra,' which was translated by Bodairushi, Bodhiruci, in the early part of the eighth century.
Messenger' means a messenger of Dainichinyorai.
In Mikkyo one 'Buddha' is considered to appear in the three figures of 'jishorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of own-nature),' 'shoborinjin (shohorinjin, the embodiment of the wheel of the true Dharma)' and 'kyoryorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of injunction).'
Jishorinjin (Nyorai)' means the figure that embodies the universal truth and the state of enlightenment itself, while 'Shoborinjin (Bosatsu)' means the figure that preaches the universal truth and the state of enlightenment in an easily understood manner.
As opposed to these, 'kyoryorinjin' is the figure that implements intervention very aggressively as it admonishes a person who doesn't follow Buddhism even with the threat of an awful appearance, and compels the cessation of hostility toward Buddhism.
Fudo Myoo is said to be the kyoryorinjin of Dainichinyorai.
It is shown as a figure of anger in order to relieve the living things who suffer earthly desires and for whom relief is more difficult to find.
Besides, it is said that when Shaka determined that 'I won't stand up from here until I reach enlightenment' after other ascetic training for enlightenment and was seated under a lime tree, devils from all over the world poured in so as to defeat Shaka, but Shaka showed a gesture of Koma (降魔) using the fingers quietly, and by keeping a soft expression, and made the devils surrender immediately before its superior power.
Fudo Myoo is also said to be a figure that expresses Shaka's inner determination at that time.
It means that even in the calm and benevolent Shaka's mind there was the hardest heart that belied the determination to guard Buddhism.
It is also said that its expression of anger shows benevolent affection as a father who watches over his children, being a figure of paternal love that is tender in mind while on the outside it appears to be strict.
In 'Chirisanmaya-kyo Sutra' there is a story that Fudo Myoo defeated (調伏) Daijizaiten, Mahesvara, (Shiva, the supreme god in Hinduism).
According to the story, when Dainichinyorai reached enlightenment and became Buddha, all creatures in the three worlds came to a meeting, but Daijizaiten, who was conceited and considered himself to be the master of 3,000 worlds, did not accept the call.
Daijizaiten said, 'Jimyo-sya (持明者) (the spirit that uses magic in India, Yasha Myoo in this story) will come as a messenger, but its magic will become useless if I create dirty things with my magic, place them all around and stay inside,' and put up a barrier (結界) in order so as not to be approached.
When Fudo Myoo called for Daijizaiten, he was surrounded by a dirty barrier so that Fudo Myoo called back Fujo-kongo, a dirty water kongo (Ususama Myoo), and made him eat up the dirty barrier.
Then, Fudo Myoo captured Daijizaiten immediately and took him away to Buddha.
However, Daijizaiten said, 'You are only Yasha, a class of semidivinity usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified with malignant spirits, but I am a king of gods,' and was able to escape repeatedly.
Buddha ordered that 'he should be condemned to death,' so that Fudo Myoo stamped Daijizaiten and his wife (Uma) to death.
(Gozanze Yasha Myoo)
When Fudo Myoo asked Buddha how to deal with Daijizaiten, Buddha said, 'Revive him,' so Fudo Myoo revived him by reciting the Hokkaisei Shingon mantra (法界生真言).
When Daijizaiten was pleased and wondered, 'Who is this Yasha?' Buddha replied that he was 'the master of Buddhas.'
Daijizaiten was deeply moved, since he knew that there existed the master of Buddhas over respectable Buddhas in all things, and he obtained a certification (授記) to become a Buddha in the future, thanks to 'Daio (the great king)' of Fudo Myoo.
In this story it is characteristic that Fudo Myoo is called Yasha, Daio and the master of Buddha.
Although the statues of Myoo in Mikkyo are often shown as mysterious figures with many faces and many upper arms, Fudo Myoo is basically shown as a figure with one face and two upper arms (in the iconic collection of Mikkyo and others, Fudo Myoo with many bodies is also drawn, but it is rarely configured as a statue).
Additionally, many bodies of the statue are basically expressed in ugly, lurid colors.
It is said that this is a muddy color and shows the relief of the living things in the mud of earthly desires.
However, in Chiri-kyo Sutra and others its body color is described as blue-black or red-yellow and it is generally shaped as a figure with seven topknots or hachiyorenge (八葉蓮華) on the head with the right canine tooth bared upward and the left canine tooth bared outside, wearing clothing the color of red soil.
After it was imported to Japan, variations were created, but it remained a figure with one face and two arms.
Particularly since Fudo-ho, there was the popularization of the prayer for the aid of Fudo Myoo to end calamity and cause prosperity, by Kukai and Enchin, and many variations of the statue were produced.
Namikiri Fudo (Koyasan Nan-in Temple) associated with the historical event in which Kukai went to Tang, and Fudo Myoo, which is shown in yellow, red and blue colors based on Enchin's feelings, were created.
Goshiki Fudo, the Fudo statues shown with black, white, red, blue and yellow eyes, were also created, having been said to originate from the place names of Meguro and Mejiro (metropolitan Tokyo) (however, there are contrary opinions).
The features of statues are mostly those of fat youths (according to "Dainichi-kyo Sutra") who have turbulent hair by anger to bempatsu, a long rope of hair hanging down the left side of the face and the left shoulder of a sculpted figure in order to avoid being an obstacle to movement, are lightly dressed without hogu (the utensils used during ritual incantation and prayer) as much as possible, and have their clothing tied with a ripped sleeve.
It is said that its costume was based on a figure of slave or follower in ancient India so that it shows that it is a person who follows a disciplinant and guards him.
It is generally shown as a figure having a sankoken (three-pronged sword) in the right hand, of koma (which drives off Satan and cuts away people's earthly desires at the same time), kenjaku (a kind of lariat to tie evil and relieve people bound with earthly desires) in the left hand, shoulders the karuraen (a flame like the shape of 'Karura,' a firebird of legend that eats up three poisons), and determines, 'I shall not move from here until I relieve all people,' sitting on the rough rock (large rock) with an angry face (in Japan many standing statues are seen other than seated statues).
Fudo Myoo was created in India and transmitted to Japan through China, but there are very few works of statues in India and China.
In Japan, it was shaped actively in accordance with the prevalence of Mikkyo.
Among the existing statues of Fudo Myoo in Japan, the old statues such as the statue in the To-ji Temple Lecture Hall and the statue in To-ji Temple Mie-do, which were shaped at the first part of the Heian period, were produced by realistic expressions (with normal eyes) as it opened both eyes at the front, chewed the bottom lip with a front tooth and had both canine teeth bared downward.
However, in more recent years the statues with asymmetrical shapes such as heaven-and-earth eyes (天地眼) (open right eye and narrowed left eye, or staring up toward heaven with the right eye and staring down toward earth with the left eye), and having the right canine tooth bared upward and the left canine tooth bared downward (牙上下出).
This is influenced by 'Fudo Juku-kan (Nineteen Characteristic Signs of Fudo Myoo'), which was preached by Annnen, a priest of the Tendai sect, and others of the tenth century in order to image Fudo Myoo.
In more recent times the expression of Fudo Myoo statues with heaven-and-earth eyes had become almost completely mainstream, but even after that the statues with normal eyes in the old style, with eyes that were open and had both canine teeth biting the bottom lip, were seen somewhat, such as the standing statue of Fudo Myoo with two youths in Ganjoju-in Temple, Shizuoka, made by Unkei.
Because the standing statue of Fudo Myoo in Joraku-ji Temple in Kanagawa Prefecture, which was made by Unkei at nearly the same time of the Fudo Myoo statue in Ganjoju-in Temple, was shaped with heaven-and-earth eyes although its body was virtually identical to that of the statue in Ganjoju-in Temple, it seems that Unkei distinguished facial expressions.
Therefore, it could be said that whether the figure had normal eyes or heaven-and-earth eyes wasn't due to the difference in the times but instead depended on the client's intention, aims and so on.
It is known that this parquet statue made of Japanese cypress was shaped by Unkei with 10 artists specializing in Buddhist statues as his disciples (小仏師）at the request of Yoshimori WADA.
In some cases Fudo Myoo was shaped as a figure that brought followers (called hachidai-doji).
However, it is often shown on pictures and statues by the triad style which brought two youths of Kongara-doji (the youth Kongara) and Seitaka-doji (the youth Seitaka) among hachidai-doji (it is called the statue of Fudo Myoo with two youths or the Fudo triad).
In the triad style, it is common that Seitaka-doji is placed on the right of Fudo Myoo (on the observers' left) and Kongara-doji is placed on the left (on the observers' right).
Many kongara-doji are shown as baby-faced figures that stare toward Fudo Myoo intently with hands clasped in prayer, while on the contrary many Seitaka-doji are shown as naughty boys with kongosho (vajra club) and kongo-bo (both are weapons) in their hands.
The remaining six hachidai-doji are Eko-doji, Eki-doji, Anokuta-doji, Shitoku-doji, Ugubaga-doji and Shojo-biku.
As the works of these hachidai-doji, the statue in Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple Fudo-do (a national treasure) is well known.
At Setagayasan Kannon-ji Temple in the Setagaya Ward of Tokyo there are the statue of Fudo Myoo and the statue of hachidai-doji made by Koen (a grandson of Unkei), an artist of Buddhism statue in the Kamakura period, which were moved from the abolished Uchiyama Eikyu-ji Temple in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture.
Moreover, there is no work of Fudo Myoo with hachidai-doji as followers in Sanskrit sutras, so it is said to have been invented in China.
Additionally, there are the statues called the 36 youths or the 48 messengers.
They are often placed in the center of the main Myoo (which is called Godai Myoo), as are those of To-ji Temple.
Many sutras, including the Dainichi-kyo sutra, are preferred for reading, especially in Shugen-do.
Representative examples are as follows:
Shomudoson Daiinuo Himitsudarani-kyo Sutra
The story is that Fugen Bosatsu preached Fudo Myoo, which he felt, to the living things with Monju Bosatsu at the great Buddhist mass of Dainichinyorai, and that Dainichinyorai gave a favorable blessing.
Moreover, in the story of revenge by Kumawakamaru, a son of Suketomo HINO in Taiheiki, the scene whereby the practitioner escapes from the pursuer by boat while praying for Myoo is an homage of the part, 'It brings to the opposite share over sea by the boat of Buddhism (大法).'
Bussetsu Shofudo-kyo Sutra
It abstracts the essence of the above sutra's teaching, and was established in Japan.
It is written in the style that Fudo Myoo itself preaches.
It describes that Fudo Myoo lives in the disciplinant's mind (Fudo Myoo is indeed a disciplinant) because the ways of the living things' minds aren't the same (the way of reaching enlightenment is different individually) so that Fudo Myoo makes their wishes come true by changing its figure in accordance with each person).
Keishu Shomudoson Himitsudarani-kyo Sutra
It bears the strong influence of Mikkyo, such as the addition of a symbolic gesture with the fingers (印を結ぶ).
The following four are similar to Santan-kyo sutra (讃嘆経), which considers that Fudo Myoo is an existence that represents other venerable states and Japanese gods as well.
In those sutras Fudo Myoo is not described as a transcendental absolutist that is superior to other gods and Buddhas but is described on the basis of the above thought, that the way to reach enlightenment is different individually because the ways of living things' minds aren't the same).

Dainichinyorai (mahaavairocana in Sanskrit) is a venerable entity of the pantheistic Nyorai (the Dharmakaya Buddha), which is thought of as a unit of the universe itself in Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism).
Because its light shines over all the world, it is called Hensho or Dainichi.
The symbol of Sanmayagyo is a pagoda in Vajradhatumandala and Gorinto, the five-ring pagoda in Garbha-mandala.
Shushi (Mikkyo) (Shuji) was vaM in Vajradhatumandala and aaH or a in Garbha-mandala.
It is a hierarchy of Daibirushanabutsu-Jimpenkaji-kyo Sutra (Dainichi-kyo Sutra) and is the master of Garbha-mandala (the central Eight-Petal Court, or Chuudaiihachiyouin), as described by the Dainichi-kyo sutra.
Moreover, it's the center of Vajradhatumandala Gochi-nyorai (Five Wisdom nyorai, or Tathagatas), which the Kongocho-kyo sutra describes.
In the Shingon sect, which was founded by Kukai, it is the most important Buddha with which a disciplinant should ultimately integrate.
Fudo Myoo is regarded as an incarnation of Dainichinyorai, a fundamental Buddha in Mikkyo or an expression of its inner determination.
In Tibetan Buddhism, which greatly incorporates the latter part of Mikkyo, Dainichinyorai is revered as the center of the Five Buddhas (gobutsu) as well as Gochi-nyorai.
In Tibetan Buddhism it is commonly expressed as Nyorai's figure without jewelry or is sometimes drawn as a Buddha having many faces.
The form of statue is expressed by the seated figure like Bosatsu (Bodhisattva), who wears luxurious accessories such as a crown and a yoraku, a string of beads or lace-work used to decorate Buddhist statues and objects.
This imitates the figure of ancient Indian royalty.
Generally, Nyorai is expressed as a lightly dressed figure free of any accessory, but Dainichinyorai is particularly expressed as a monarch that wears the existence of the universe like an accessory.
The symbolic gesture with the fingers of Vajradhatu Dainichinyorai is Chiken-in (the knowledge-fist mudra), and that of Garbhadhatu Dainichinyorai is Hokkai Join (the Dharma-realm meditation mudra).
About the theory that Dainichinyorai originates from Ahura Mazda
There is a theory that Dainichinyorai (Makabirushanabutsu (Mahavairocana), mahaavairocana) originates from Ahura Mazda, the supreme god in Zoroastrianism.
It is based on the attribution of the sun and wisdom and the belief of fire, but there is a large disparity in dharmas between Zoroastrianism and Mikkyo.
There is another theory that Ahura Mazda originates from Varuna, a god of contract in Mitanni and Hittite.
This theory assumes that Varuna was a pair of Mithra (a god of light) since ancient times and that he was Asura, but there is no other significant similarity.
Additionally, there is the theory that Dainichinyorai originates from Virocana, the king of the Asura family in Indian mythology.
Moreover, the other theory considers it to be a unit of Dainichinyorai that developed from Vairocana, since the name is similar to Virocana, the hierarchy of the Kegon-kyo sutra.
It seems that the theory is based on the story of Chandogya Upanishad.
However, in 'the Mahdbharata,' an epic poem of India, Virocana means the sun god but doesn't necessarily mean only King Asura.
Moreover, since Visnu as the sun god also has this synonym, it isn't considered to be the immediate origin.
This theory that Dainichinyorai originates from King Asura and the supreme god of Zoroastrianism remains inconclusive.
(In fact, the origins of the other gods are often invalid except for the similarities among names.)

"Nyonin Kinsei (No Women Admitted)" means forbiddance for women to enter shrines and temples, reijo (sacred ground), ceremonial sites and others, as well as the limitation to unobstructed cultivation and worship by men.
There is a temporary Nyonin Kinsei which considers particular period related with women's menses as a period of abstention, while there is a permanent Nyonin Kinsei which constantly prohibits women's entering in distinction from men.
Particularly, the barrier to regulate women's entry to sacred mountains is called the 'nyonin kekkai,' and the stones to show the borderline for women were placed at that border.
However, for religious female believers Nyonin-do was built as a place where women could devote Buddhist invocations outside of the kekkai (border).
Additionally, the place which permits women to worship and practice unobstructed cultivation is called a 'nyonin koya.'
After the cultural enlightenment of the Meiji period, the stipulation of nyonin kekkai was released with regard to many sacred mountains.
Other places have also been released in recent years, in accordance with women's social progress and the discussion of 'nyonin kaikin (release for women) that followed.
The places that keep the tradition of Nyonin Kinsei remain only in a small proportion.
Nyonin kinsei, such as in regard to sacred mountains, are considered to be based mainly on Shugen-do's tradition.
Because Shugen-do was established through the syncretization of Buddhism (mainly Mikkyo, or Esoteric Buddhism) with the ancient Japanese Shinto faith, Taoism from China and others, it is difficult to clearly discern why it prohibits women's entry to sacred mountains.
The reason originated in Buddhist commandments
In the original Buddhism, no commandments existed that prohibited entry by women with barriers at particular places.
In Shobogenzo, written by Dogen, there is a criticism of nyonin kekkai in Japanese Buddhism as 'a laughing matter in Japan,' and Honen, Shinran and others were critical in their views of nyonin kekkai.
However, Buddhism considers human desires as bonno (earthly desires) and sees an ideal to control bonno by wisdom, so that it recommends the control of sexual desire, which is the most difficult human desire to overcome.
Accordingly, in the commandments for priests there are strict restrictions for activities that could stimulate sexual desires such as the prohibition of sexual intercourse (fuin-kai), that of masturbation (koshutsusho-kai), that of contact with women (shoku-nyonin-kai), that of using evil-minded words (sogo-kai), that of urging sexual intercourse as a memorial service (tanshinsaku-kuyo-kai), that of staying alone with a woman (byosho-fujo-kai), and that of doing what which incurs a doubt about their relationship at the time of being alone with a woman (rosho-fujo-kai).
Moreover, the mountaineering ascetic, who is a practitioner of austerities as half priest and half layman, also needs to keep at least fuin-kai during unobstructed cultivation (one of the hassai-kai, or eight precepts).
Incidentally, lay people are also prohibited from indecent sexual acts (such as premarital intercourse, extramarital affair, adultery, indecent assault, bestiality and rape) as fujain-kai (no sexual misconduct) (one of the five commandments).
Additionally, it is recommended that lay people keep fuin-kai only during the period in which they devote unobstructed cultivation, such as in Zen seated meditation and Buddhist invocation.
It seems that in order to achieve those goals, women were removed from the places of unobstructed cultivation by men in Shugen-do.
On the contrary, nunneries (facilities for priestesses) were originally specified as facilities attached to temples with a resident priest (facilities for priests) (for the purpose of protecting the priestess from sexual violence) so that it was difficult to remove men on a strict basis.
Additionally, in Buddhism it was originally prohibited for priests or priestess (except Buddha) to make a member of the opposite sex enter the Buddhist priesthood as a disciple (in order to avoid the ruination of the priest who would have his mistress around him as a disciple).
(Only a priest can make a man enter the Buddhist priesthood, and only Ama (nun) can make a woman enter the Buddhist priesthood.)
The facility necessary for entering Buddhist priesthood is called the kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform).
The person who entered priesthood for the first time in Japan was an ama, but from the Nara period to the Kamakura period when the placement of a kaidan needed permission from the Imperial Court, all kaidans such as those at Todai-ji Temple and Enryaku-ji Temple were subject to male priests so that it is believed the difficulty of women's jikai (handing down the precepts) and tokudo (entry to the Buddhist priesthood) were related to nyonin kinsei.
However, Buddhist commandments are different among priests, practitioners of austerities and lay people as mentioned above, and there are differences among sects in the contents of commandments as well as their interpretations and severity.
Therefore, some nunneries adopt the policy of 'no men admitted' and some temples in mountain areas do not adopt nyonin kinsei.
The reason for the uncleanliness of blood in Shinto
In Shinto, the blood that is separated and flows from the body of a living thing is considered to be unclean.
(This is the concept of considering a part of the body, meaning what is separated from the body, as unclean, which is also perceived in regard to the hair, nails and released bodily fluids; and similar ideas exist in other religions and myths.)
For this reason there has, since ancient times, been a taboo that prohibits women in menstruation and puerperal period from entering sacred places (such as shrines) and touching sacred things (such as a mikoshi, or a sacred palanquin).
Originally, not only women but also men bloodied due to injuries were prohibited from entering sacred places, while hunting and other activities in sacred places were prohibited for the same reason; however, it seems that based on a characteristic of male chauvinist thinking in the feudal era, only the uncleanliness of blood during menstruation and puerperal period had been emphasized and used as the reason for the removal of women from sacred places.
The faith in divine power such as in Taoism and Mikkyo
There is a theory that this is due to the expectation of power in Buddhism and divine power by incantation and prayer against priests, mainly as influenced by Taoism and Mikkyo in ancient Japan.
It was thought that the thorough sila (morality) was necessary in order to keep the power of Buddhism, which was needed for priest's prayer.
Among the stories in which Sennin, a wizard, loses divine power due to his sexual desire, the story of Kume-no-sennin in "Konjaku Monogatari (Tales of Times Now Past)" is famous.
According to that story, he was attracted by young woman's white shins who was washing clothes on the shore of Kume-gawa River, lost divine power, fell down from heaven and married with that woman.
The syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism in medieval times
It is thought that different views on the taboos of Buddhism, Shinto and Taoism as above were syncretized in medieval times, and that the basic idea of present Nyonin Kinsei and Nyonin Kekkai was established led by mountain temples and Shugen-do around the Kamakura period.
Additionally, since the Kamakura period more and more of the literature distorted and cited a description in consciousness-only theory of ' 女人地獄使。能断仏種子。外面似菩薩。内心如夜叉 (Women are messengers from hell. They can cut Buddha's seeds. Their outside faces resemble Bosatsu. Their minds are like Yasha (devil))' (there is a superstition adapted from the Kegon-kyo Sutra) and another description in the Hoke-kyo Sutra of ' 又女人身。猶有女人五障説 (There exist women. There is a theory that women are five obstacles)' as 'Because women are unclean, they can neither become Buddha nor be relieved,' apart from the original meanings or contexts.
(No such meaning is found in the originals.)
For these reasons nyonin kinsei is sometimes interpreted as being based on the philosophy regarding women in Kamakura Buddhism.
However, it should be noted that there were founders of sects in the Kamakura period, such as Honen and Dogen, who were critical of nyonin kinsei.
Other factors contributing to the origin of nyonin kinsei
Additionally, there is an opinion that it is because the place of unobstructed cultivation in Shugen-do was in a severe, trackless mountain area.
Alpine climbing accidents are not rare, even today.
Moreover, in ancient times mountain areas were thought to be dangerous places where the evil spirits of the mountains and rivers lived.
Therefore, mountain areas were places that women, who could give birth, did not or must not approach in order to ensure their safety.
On the contrary, because mountain areas were such places, practitioners of austerity chose them as places of severe unobstructed cultivation where men could not be caught up in thoughts of women.
Once the mountain path had come to be maintained well in accordance with civilization, religious women began to climb the mountains, relying on the mountaineering ascetic; this confounded the mountaineering ascetics, who then determined the borderlines of taboo by putting barrier stones and built women's halls for prayer and preaching.
Kunio YANAGIDA, a scholar of folklore, paid attention to the barrier stone called Uba-ishi at the start of a trail up Mt. Iwaki-san (or Ubasute-yama), a mountain where old women would be abandoned, and in "Imo-no-chikara" and "Bikuni-ishi" introduced a legend that a woman who crossed over the barrier stone would change into a stone.
It was thought that the area beyond the barrier stone or border stone was the other world (the other world over the mountain) and that a religious person could gain a superpower by doing unobstructed cultivation in a kind of other, cloistered world.
Moreover, there is a theory that it was caused by avoiding the jealousy of female gods because the mountain god Iwanaga-hime had, since ancient times, been considered to be a female.
For example, in the legend of Tono three mountains, which are seen in "Tono Monogatari (Tale of Tono)," each of three female gods lived in Mt. Hayachine-san and Mt. Rokkoshi-san, and they had kept nyonin kinsei for a long time.
It could be thought that this was a taboo myth in order that women would not approach dangerous mountains.
However, Tagiri-bime, a god of Munakata-taisha Shrine Okitsunomiya on Oki-no-shima Island, which today keeps nyonin kinsei, is also a female god so that the myth that female gods were jealous and abhorred women might be established differently.
According to the other theory, there is an explanation that women have difficulty practicing severe unobstructed cultivation because 'women tend to be psychic,' like priestesses and Itako (people who can communicate with the dead).
As the reasons for Nyonin Kinsei, there exist various origins and theories as mentioned above.
In each place, each origin has been transmitted.
Additionally, there is a case that these were combined and changed over a period of history so that it is said to be difficult to reach general ideas from any one originating point.
Additionally, it could be thought that the time when nyonin kinsei was adopted in festivals was the Edo period or after Meiji period when male chauvinism became widespread, and in "Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)" there is a description that women would join in festivals.
Moreover, in ancient Japan women were believed to be sacred persons who were generally haunted spirits, so that women were thought to have many qualifications for being enshrined as god, as represented by Himiko.
For example, in Okinawa, where Shinto is said to remain in its original form, women were called 'kaminchu' (men were called uminchu) and no men were admitted in the place where Shinto priest (such as Noro) would perform religious services, as opposed to nyonin kinsei.
A trace of this custom remains today.
On November 3, 2005, the members of 'a project to climb Mt. Omine-san,' which was set up by dissenters against the nyonin kinsei of Mt. Omine-san, visited the spot in order to climb Mt. Omine-san, and requested the release to the temple's side by submitting a questionnaire, but it ended in failure.
As a result, both sides agreed to have a chance to talk another day and broke up, but immediately after that the three women of the project stubbornly climbed the mountain in order to assert their view of the problem.
Against this action, criticism came from the temple's side, local people in opposition and portions of the mass media.
While there is an opinion that "praises" the activity of the project side (it is a gesture of agreement with male chauvinism and an evil custom that is opposed to the principle of gender equality), there is another opinion that nyonin kinsei should be maintained firmly (it succeeds the religious and traditional culture that is rooted in Japan and does not promote discrimination such as male chauvinism so that the enforcement of mounting climbing is a hasty and foolish action that violates Japanese culture).
Additionally, there is an opinion that criticizes the project side from the standpoint of the freedom of religion (even if a certain faith or custom seems to be superstitious in the context of modern values, it is not good to carelessly and forcibly abandon it so high-handedly, but instead one should wait for the believers to reform voluntarily).
Moreover, some intellectuals criticize the project side because they do not act to require abolishment or amendment against the festivals and places in which traditionally no men are admitted, as a contrary practice in Japan (such as Utaki (Okinawa)).

The Lineage of Shinto
Oki-no-shima Island: Even men must purify themselves by abstaining from eating meat at the time of entry.
Tanabu Matsuri Festival (Mutsu City Aomori Prefecture): In recent years women have been permitted to pull floats, but basically it adopts nyonin kinsei so that women are not permitted to ride on floats.
Kanto poles (Akita City)
Yamahoko floats in the Gion Matsuri Festival (Kyoto City): There are women's Hayashi-kata in some Yamahoko floats, but nyonin kinsei is adopted in regard to Naginata-boko, the first float of the parade.

Juichimen Kannon (ekadaza mukha in Sanskrit) is one of the venerable entities of Bosatsu, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
The Sanskrit name means 'eleven faces.'
It is one of the transformed bodies of Kannon Bodhisattva (Kannon Bosatsu) and is one of the Roku Kannon (Six Kannons).
As the features were explained in 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra' translated by Genjo, it is a Bosatsu having 11 faces on the head except for a face on the main body.
The sanmayagyo (symbol) is a suihei, a small water bottle, and a glowing lotus.
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) (Shuji) is ka and hriiH.
It is also called Daikofusho Kannon, and it is said that the 10 faces on the front, back, left and right among the 11 faces on the head show Jicchi (ten stages) while the topmost Butsumen (the head of a Buddha) shows Buddhahood, or nirvana.
It is said that this shows the pious act of cutting away 11 kinds of ignorance and the earthly desires (無明煩悩) of living things, and to open Buddhahood.
It is also called Daihi Sendai because it has a vow as 'I do not stop without relieving people (救わで止まんじ).'
As a role of Roku Kannon, it civilizes (摂化) living things in Ashura-do (the Asura realm).
In Japanese it has various names such as 'Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu' and 'Juichimen Kanzeon Bosatsu,' but the name assigned as a national treasure or important cultural property is 'Juichimen Kannon.'
It seems to be a venerable status (尊格) that originated in India, but there is no distinguished work in India; however, its statues were produced eagerly in China and Japan through the dissemination of 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra' translated by Genjo in Tang.
In Japan, the statues of Juichimen Kannon were produced and worshipped eagerly since the Nara period, and the statue of Juichimen Kannon in the wall paintingof Horyu-ji Temple Kondo (法隆寺金堂) (which was damaged by a fire in 1949) seems to be the oldest work.
The other works from the Nara period are the statue of Shorin-ji Temple in Nara (a national treasure, coming from Daigorin-ji Temple (Omiwa-tera Temple), which is a jingu-ji temple (a temple associated with a shrine) in Omiwa-jinja Shrine) and the statue of Kannon-ji Temple in Kyoto (a national treasure), the statue of Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara (an important cultural property) and so on.
The principal image of Buddha of Nigatsu-do in Todai-ji Temple is also Juichimen Kannon, but its feature is not clear because it is a Buddhist image that has infrequently been shown to the public since ancient times.
Omizutori,' an annual event of that temple, is the event for the confession of sins to Juichimen Kannon (Juichimen Keka Hoyo).
Additionally, according to folklore, Taicho, a priest of Shugen-do (an ancient Japanese religion) in the Nara Period, had practiced asceticism while praying Juichimen Kannon since childhood, opened Hakusan, which is famous as Reijo (sacred ground) and succeeded in placing (感得) Myori Gongen, which had Juichimen Kannon as its honji (substance).
After the Heian period, Shuei, who learned the ways of both the Shingon and Tendai sects, moved this Myori Gongen to Hieizan Enryaku-ji Temple, which is one of the Sanno Shichisha (Seven Sanno Shrines) as Kyakujin Gongen (an enshrined diety to pray for the increase of customers in merchant families).
Juichimen Kannon is seen as a Bosatsu that performed the pious act of removing all hardships from living things due to its deep mercy, so that many statues had been produced in figures such as that of a goddess.
Many statues of Juichimen Kannon put Kebutsu (the artificial Buddha) on the front top of the head and put faces of emotions such as Butsumen, Bosatsumen (Bodhisattva heads), Shinnumen (three angry faces), Kugejoshutsumen (plain faces with fangs) and Daishomen (a laughing face) on the head while letting the right hand hang down, and having in the left hand a vase in which there is a lotus.
This is based on 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra,' translated by Genjo.
Shinnumen is an expression of anger with the arching of the eyebrows and a downturned mouth; Kugejoshutsumen is an expression in which a canine tooth is bared between pressed lips, and Daishomen is an expression of a smile, more specifically a big grin.
Usually, Butsumen is put atop the head, Bosatsumen (three faces) at the front side on the head, Shinnumen (three faces) on the left side (on the observers' right), Kugejoshutsumen (three faces) on the right side (on the observers' left) and Daishomen (one face) on the back which can not be seen from observers.
According to 'Juichimen Shinjushin-kyo Sutra,' the right hand which is hanging down has a beadroll and the left hand holds a vase with a red lotus in it.
However, in the case of statue, beadroll in the right hand is often omitted or lost.
On the other hand, the statue of Juichimen Kannon as a principle image of Buddha in Hase-dera Temple (真言宗豊山派総本山長谷寺), the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Buzan-ha, has as is customary a lotus in a vase in the left hand, but it is the greatest characteristic that it has a big shakujo (pewter staff) and stands upon a rock.
The statues of Juichimen Kannon that are placed in many Buzan-ha temples show these features, and consequently they are called 'Juichimen Kannon of the Hase-dera style.'
In the pure esoterica that was transmitted by Kukai, the statues with four arms were produced based on the sutra translated by Fuku, but the statues with two arms were predominant in Japan.

Jizo Bosatsu (d kSiti gharbha in Sanskrit) is one of the venerable entities of Bosatsu, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
d kSiti' means 'the earth' and 'gharbha' means 'in the womb' or 'womb,' but it is freely translated into 'Jizo.'
It is also translated into Jiji, Myodo and Muhenshin.
The sanmayagyo (symbols) are Nyoi-hoju (a sacred jewel that is said to remove suffering and be capable of granting every wish), Doban (a kind of sublime article, a rod with a streamer on the top) and Shakujo (a pewter staff).
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) (Shuji) is ha.
It is named after the belief that it enwraps troubled people with its immeasurably great mercy and saves them, such that the earth has the power to cultivate all lives.
It is generally believed to be 'a protective deity of children' so that the sweets that children love are often offered on the altar.
Generally, it is affectionately called 'Ojizo-san' or 'Ojizo-sama.'
It is considered that it follows Shaka-muni Buddha in the Touriten (Trayastrimsa heaven) and senses the capability of living things each morning in Dhyana (meditation), and that it is a Bosatsu that relieves living things who live in the wheel of life of Rikudo (the six realms of Jigoku-do (Naraka realm, or hell realm) (地獄道), Gaki-do (Preta realm, or hungry ghost realm), (餓鬼道), Chikusho-do (Animal realm) (畜生道), Shura-do (Ashura realm, or realm of demigods) (修羅道), Jin-do (Human realm) (人道) and Ten-do (Deva realm, or realm or blissful state) (天道), while there exists no Buddha in this world after Shaka entered nirvana and before Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva) appears, 5670 million years later.
Many statues are generally expressed in the figure of a shaven Shomon or Bikuni (figures of priests or priestesses) putting on robes with Nyoi-hoju in the left hand and Shakujo in the right hand or with Nyoi-hoju in the left hand and Yogan-in figurative gestures (wish-granting mudra, showing the palm and hanging down) in the right hand.
However, in Mikkyo it is expressed in the normal figure that piles its hair high and wears accessory as a principal image of Garbha-mandala Jizo-in; it has Nichirin (日輪) in front of the right-side breast in the right hand and has a lotus that bears Doban while placing the left hand on the left hip.
The benefits of Jizo Bosatsu Hongan Kudoku-kyo sutra are as follows:
Twenty-eight benefits

Among Enra-o-juki Shishu Gyakushu Shoshichiojo Jodo-kyo Sutra (閻羅王授記四衆逆修生七往生浄土経) (Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra, Yuxiu Shiwang Shengqijing Sutra) and Juo-kyo Sutra (Jizo Bosatsu Hossin Innen Juo-kyo Sutra), a belief that Jizo Bosatsu is the same entity as Enma, tied with Juo belief in Taoism.
According to that, the king Enma watches people closely as Jizo Bosatsu so that he can fairly bring the dead to justice.
In Japan since the Heian period, when the Pure Land Faith was widespread, people increasingly believed that the living things who could not be reborn in the Land of Bliss after death inevitably went to Hell, so that they had to hope from Jizo Bosatsu for relief from their suffering in Hell.
There is a folk belief that Jizo Bosatsu guards children who are bullied by ogres at Sai-no-kawara (the limbo of children) so that Jizo Bosatsu has been worshipped for the veneration of children and miscarried fetuses.
Moreover, in the Kansai district Jizo Bon is held as a children's festival.
Additionally, it has been syncretized with Doso-shin (Doso-jin), the traveler's guardian deity, so that many stone statues were enshrined by the roadsides throughout Japan.
In China, Jizo Bosatsu is called Jizo-o Bosatsu (tied with Juo thought) and is worshipped as a master of the underworld.
Because it brings the dead to justice as the king Emma, it is mainly worshipped in order to wish for relief (from Hell) after death.
In the Naka Ward of Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture (Japan) there exists Jizo-o-byo Temple (Chuka Giso) (Chinese cemetary), which was built by Chinese residents and enshrines the rest of the dead.
The sacred place of Jizo-o Bosatsu is Mt. Jiuhuashan, in Anhui Province.
This is based on the fact that a priest Jizo (696 to 794), who is also called Kin-osho or Kana Jizo in Shiragi, the Silla dynasty, lived in Huacheng Temple at this place.
Jizo, who entered nirvana in this place at the age of 99, remained the same figure as living when his casket was opened three years later in order to be enshrined in a tower, so that the faith to see him as the same as Jizo-o Bosatsu was created and the place of the tower became a sacred site of Jizo-o Bosatsu.
According to that historical event, it has been worshipped until now as a sacred place in Chinese Buddhism, as have Mt. Wutai Shan of Monju Bosatsu, Mt. Emeishan of Fugen Bosatsu and Mt. Putuo of Kannon Bosatsu.
In Japan the statues of Rokujizo, which consist of six statues of Jizo Bosatsu, are enshrined in various places.
This is originated from a theory that six kinds of Jizo Bosatsu relieve each of the six worlds, based on the Buddhist concept of Rokudo-rinne or Rebirth in the Six Worlds (whereby all lives repeat incarnation in the six worlds).
Each name of Rokujizo is unauthorized.
In many cases they are called Danda Jizo, Hoju Jizo, Hoin Jizo, Jiji Jizo, Jogaisho Jizo, Nikko Jizo or Kongogan Jizo, Kongoho Jizo, Kongohi Jizo, Kongodo Jizo, Hokoo Jizo, Yotenga Jizo in the order of Jigoku-do, Gaki-do, Chikusho-do, Shura-do, Jin-do and Ten-do, but some documents describe names other than the above.
At any rate, it is nearly impossible to determine each name of Jizo Bosatsu only by its features.
In Japan the statues of Rokujizo are often enshrined at the entrances to cemeteries and so on.
In the Golden Hall of Chuson-ji Temple, each of six statues of Jizo Bosatsu are placed on the three Buddhist altars in which the bodies of FUJIWARA no Kiyohira, FUJIWARA no Motohira and FUJIWARA no Hidehira are placed, and the figures of each statue are nearly identical to one another.
A long time ago there lived two kings who were abundantly merciful in India.
One of the kings thought he would relieve people by becoming Buddha by himself, and he became the Buddha called Issaichii-nyorai.
However, the other king dared to reject becoming Buddha in spite of being capable of doing so; instead he willingly went to Hell, keeping his human form, and continuously endeavored to relieve all the troubles and wandering of souls.
He is Jizo Bosatsu.
There are many stories that the miraculous efficacy of Jizo Bosatsu is enormous enough to diminish people's sins and make them Buddha, and that he relieves people as a scapegoat for their suffering.
Although Bosatsu is a Buddha ranked at high status next to Nyorai, Jizo Bosatsu stepped down from the status with the determination that ' I won't go back to the Bosatsu world unless my wish to relieve all living things comes true,' and he continued travel to relieve unrelieved living things and the souls of young children who died before their parents, walking on foot through Rokudo.
It is said that a young child who dies before his parents cannot cross the Sanzu River but must continue to build a stone stupa forever; that he must suffer from the bullying of ogres at Sai-no-kawara because he makes his parents grieve; and that he will not accrue pious acts of filial devotion to his parents.
There is a famous anecdote that Jizo Bosatsu is first to go to Sai-no-kawara and guards children from ogre, gives virtue by preaching Buddhism dharma and sutras, and leads them to the way to become Buddha.
As mentioned above, Jizo Bosatsu is the Bosatsu who relieves the weakest people above everything else, so that he has been worshipped enormously since ancient times.
Relationship to the Hungry Ghosts' Feeding Festival
In more recent times there has been a widespread story that the spot under Jizo Bosatsu's feet is the entrance of the world of Gaki (hungry ghosts).
When water is poured on the statue of Jizo Bosatsu, it pours into the mouth of Gaki, who suffers forever in the netherworld.
It is said that although Gaki in Buddhism has a burning tongue because of the sin of having told a lie in life so that he cannot drink or eat because everything in his mouth is burned away, the water through Jizo Bosatsu's mercy can reach Gaki's throat and he can interrupt suffering for a while (during which people pray for Gaki to become Buddha by reading mass and reciting sutras with great virtue as part of the Hungry Ghosts' Feeding Festival).
This is a story that shows the pious acts of Jizo Bosatsu, who is said to pour mercy upon all six worlds without prejudice; accordingly, the Hungry Ghosts' Feeding Festival was established as associated with Jizo Bosatsu.
In Buddhism a nefarious person who denies and criticizes Buddhism is called ichi-sendai (一闡提) (or simply sendai), which also means simply 'a person who has difficulty becoming Buddha,' so that Bosatsus such as Jizo Bosatsu and Kannon Bosatsu, who dared not to become Buddha through their great mercy in relieving all living things, are called 'Daihi Sendai' and are clearly distinguished from the normal sendai.
The above 'Rokujizo' is Jizo-son (statues of Jizo), who guards each of the six worlds, and therefore many statues were placed at funeral homes and graves.
Additionally, it was combined with the faith for Doso-shin (Japanese Shinto deity), so many statues were built as 'guardian deities of the barriers of town' outside of towns or on streets.
Jizo Bon is a festival that enshrines this as a principle image.
Moreover, because Doso-shin is called Shaguji, the Jizo Bosatsu that syncretized with Doso-shin came to be called Shogun (将軍) Jizo by combining the letters of "Shogun" with "Shaguji" (it is also written as 勝軍 (Shogun)).
In a folkloric tale "Journey to West," Jizo-o Bosatsu is described as he tells Gyokukotaitei (玉皇大帝) in Heaven about the violence of Sun Wu Kong (Seitentaisei, 斉天大聖), from Hell, as a master of the underworld.
On Kakaka Bisanmaei Sowaka (唵 訶訶訶 尾娑摩曳 娑婆訶)
The gods regarded as Honji Suijaku of Jizo Bosatsu in the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism are Atago-no-kami (a deity) and Amenokoyane.

Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja) is one of the Myoos (king of wisdom), being worshipped in Buddhism and having venerable status specific to Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism).
Having a Sanskrit name, Ragaraja, which is not seen in Buddhist sutras such as those of India, is a Funnu-son--a deity with a fierce expression (忿怒尊)--whose works are not found in India either.
One of the reasons living things do not believe in Buddhism is that 'they are fascinated by temporal pleasures such as bonno (earthly desires) and sexual desire,' but Aizen Myoo practices pious acts because 'bonno and sexual desire are human's instincts that are difficult to cease, so that I change these instincts into ambitions and make living things believe in Buddhism.'
Aizen Myoo has one face and six arms with Funnu-so (an angry expression found on Buddhist images just like other Myoos), and it has highly distinctive features such as a lion's crown, which symbolizes the strength to bear any problem, as well as a seated lotus position on a lotus flower blossoms in a hobyo (a flower vase), which is filled with wisdom.
Because it was originally a god to express love, the body color is red and it is often depicted with a luminous halo.
Additionally, there exists a figure of Aizen Myoo that draws a bow toward Heaven (such as 'the statue of Aizen Myoo with celestial bow' at Mt. Koya) and pictures on which different features are drawn, such as two heads.
It has a third eye on the forehead, and some people say this depicts female genitalia.
However, the reason for that view is not known and it is uncertain whether it is true.
Aizen Myoo has been worshipped since ancient times as a Buddha that controls 'love, marriage and household harmony,' as its name shows; moreover, it has been worshipped as a guardian deity of dye and textile manufacturers by interpreting 'Aizen(愛染) as Aizen (藍染), or indigo.'
Moreover, because it does not deny sexual desire, it was worshipped by prostitutes in ancient times and is worshipped by women of the present day who work in the nighttime entertainment industry.
Aizen Myoo is also depicted in pictures of the Mandala, a principal image of the Nichiren sects, facing Fudo Myoo; and it has been written in Sanskrit since Nichiren through the ages because it has a venerable status of Mikkyo transmitted by Kukai.
Moreover, it is said that Fudo Myoo in the Mandala of Nichiren sects shows the idea that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana while Aizen Myoo shows the idea that earthly desires are a pure aspiration to enlightenment.
The theoretical origin of Aizen Myoo is not known, but judging from one of the mantras of Aizen Myoo, 'Fun Takki Fun Jaha Fun,' it seems related to Takkiraja (Kama Raja （カーマ・ラージャ)), the tenth Funnu-son in the latter stage of Mikkyo.
It is said that the word "takki" means love or death, but the exact origin of the word is not known.
There is a theory that Takki originates from Dakini (ダーキニー) (Dakiniten).
Dakini is often considered to be a witch, and therefore Takkiraja could be translated as the king of witches in Japanese.
Alternatively, Takki might be a lost god or a slang term.
Kama is a goddess of love who was burned to death because she released an arrow against Shiva during ascetic practices.
The goddess Kama, which is also called Mara, seduced Buddha.
Mara has a daughter named Raga.
For details, see the article on Kama (Hinduism).
Mara is the supreme god who lives in the sixth heaven, which is also called Take-jizai-ten (the heaven where one can partake of the pleasures created in other heavens) or the sixth tenmao (devil).
For details, see the article on Tenma.
(Kama is the supreme god in Heaven, but please note that there are more worlds over heaven in Buddhism.)
Take-jizai-ten is expressed as a figure with a bow, and it is a god that controls everything in this world at will, makes others enjoy and enjoys by itself.
From the other perspective, it is a god and a seducer that makes a person feel happy.
It is said that Dainichinyorai preached at the palace of Take-jizai-ten.
Aizen Myoo could be said to be a god that changed the viewpoint against love and mastered it.
It seems that Kongoai Bosatsu is the nearest as a venerable status and was incorporated from a god who drew a bow of love or a god of love with a bow; it is interpreted as a Bosatsu in Mikkyo so that its Funnu-son corresponds to Aizen Myoo.
Although Aizen Myoo is often enshrined as an attendant, there are examples in which it is enshrined as the principal image, as follows:
Temples that enshrine Aizen Myoo as the principal image
Aizen-do (Shoman-in Temple) (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) - one of the four halls of Shitenno-ji Temple built by Prince Shotoku
The first Fudasho, a temple that issues amulets, of Saigoku Aizen Reijo (holy grounds related to Aizen Myoo in the western districts of Japan) (西国愛染霊場).
Kongosanmai-in Temple (Koya-cho, Wakayama Prefecture) - the temple related to Masako HOJO.
It enshrines Aizen Myoo, which was Nenjibutsu (a Buddhist image that is kept in close proximity for personal daily worship) of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.
The principal image is a national important cultural property.
Shana-in Temple (Nagahama City, Shiga Prefecture) - the principal image is made in the Kamakura period and a national important cultural property.
It is said that it was consecrated by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.
Aizen-in Temple (Nerima Ward, Tokyo) - the principal image is the statue of Aizen Myoo, which is a Buddhist image not usually shown to the public.
Komyosan Aizen-in Temple (光明山愛染院) (Itabashi Ward, Tokyo) - worshipped by local dye manufacturers
Other representative temples that enshrine Aizen Myoo
Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City, Nara Prefecture): This statue of Aizen Myoo (an important cultural property) was made by Zenen.
It is placed at Aizen Hall, which was formerly Konoe-ko Mandokoro Goten(近衛公政所御殿) in Kyoto Imperial Palace but was relocated there.
Jingo-ji Temple (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City) - the statue of Aizen Myoo (an important cultural property) was made by Koen, who was a busshi.
Jindo-ji Temple (Yamashiro-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto Prefecture) - the statue of Aizen Myoo with celestial bow
A statue in the Nara National Museum - the statue of Aizen Myoo (an important cultural property) was made byKaisei, a busshi in the Kamakura period.

Zazen (meditation) is a fundamental method of training in Zen Buddhism, in which one meditates sitting with correct posture.
It is sometimes written with the characters 座禅 however it is correct to use the character 坐.
Harmonize posture, breathing and mind. (choshin, chosoku, choshin respectively)
A special cushion for Zazen called a zafu is used when sitting down to meditate.
A zabuton (flat cushion) folded in two can sometimes serve as a substitute.
Sit down cross-legged on the cushion, with knees barely touching the floor.
Zazen is done in either full-lotus position or half-lotus position.
To sit in the full-lotus position, put the right foot on the left thigh and move the right heel close to the hip.
Next, put the left foot on the right thigh.
In half-lotus position only the left foot is put on the right thigh.
In either position, the three points including two legs and bottom make a balanced sitting posture.
The hands are placed together palms up with the thumbs touching in a natural arc in the hokkai-join or gesture of reality.
Face the right palm upwards and place the left palm on top.
Lightly touch the tips of the thumbs together.
With eyes half open, lower gaze to a point about one meter in front.
Pull chin in, and rest the tongue lightly on the roof of the mouth behind the front teeth, keeping mouth lightly closed.
Relax shoulders and straighten the spine.
Pull the back in and the stomach slightly forward.
Such that the nose and navel are in line.
Breathe naturally.
Breathe out and in gently from the nose.
It is said to exhale from the 'tanden' (a point in the lower abdomen).
Some temples hold zazen meetings.
Also, the correct way to do zazen is broadcast on A and available for viewing free.
Zazen is sometimes perceived as the same as visual meditation ('meiso'), however the direction of zazen is different to that of visual meditation in which the eyes are closed and an object is visualized in the mind.
The purpose of zazen is not to be bound by the images in your mind but to experience the world and yourself as it really is, and reach a spiritual place of nothingness.
The priest Dogen, founder of the Soto Sect of Buddhism, emphasized the concept of 'shikantaza' which is a Japanese term for zazen and means just sitting.
It means to just sit for the sake of sitting, and not for the purpose of gaining some merit or reward.
Medicine
Medical researchers are studying the slowing of breathing during zazen meditation.
Seiryu Gongen (清瀧権現), or Seiryo Gongen, is a guardian goddess of Daigo-ji Temple, the grand head temple of the Shingon sect Daigo-ha branch in the Fushimi Ward of Kyoto City.
Additionally, it is called Seiryu Daigongen (Seiryo Daigongen) and is also written as 清滝権現 (Seiryu Gongen, Seiryo Gongen).
Honjibutsu, the original Buddhist identity of a Shinto deity, is Jundei Kannon and Nyoirin Kannon.
Seiryu Gongen isn't described in Kyoki (sutra), but according to Kukai's Goyuigo (written will) it was Zennyo Ryuo, (Dragon King Zennyo) the third (also said to be fourth) daughter of Shakara (Sakara, Shagara), one of the Hachidai Ryuo (the eight dragon kings of Indian myth), and lived in Munetsuchi (無熱池) (a legendary pond that is said to be located in the Himalayas).
There are two kinds of dragons--good and evil--and Zennyo Ryuo was a good dragon who did not do harm; it is a golden snake of 2.5 cm long who appeared with the respect of the dharma of mantra, Shingon, and stands atop a snake of about 3 meters long.
It is said that it appeared at the time of a religious ceremony to pray for rainfall held by Kukai at Shinsen-en.
Zennyo Ryuo came flying to Shoryu-ji Temple (Qinglongsi Temple) in China, where Mikkyo was guarded, and became a guardian goddess of the temple, 'Seiryu.'
In later years, when Kobo-daishi Kukai visited Seiryu-ji Temple and learned Buddhism, he begged to be given Samaya-vrata but it was not permitted.
When Kukai came back to Japan, it appeared in a ship and Kukai swore to guard Mikkyo, so that it was transferred by praying at the foot of Mt. Takao-san in Rakusai, Kyoto.
At that time it crossed the sea so that it came to be called 'Seiryu Gongen (清瀧権現)' with respect in Japan, adding the left-hand radical of 'Sanzui (sense of water)' to the Chinese character, 龍 (dragon).
Accordingly, the name of the river at the foot of Mt. Takao-san was changed to Kiyotaki (清滝）.
Moreover, Eun was invited to pray when transferring it to Ansho-ji Temple.
After Seiryu Gongen came flying to Japan and visited various temples, it descended to the peak of Daigo-ji Temple, in the present place, in around 900 by the invocations of Shobo.
Subsequently it became the goddess that guarded Shingon Mikkyo, which has been transmitted in that temple.
In 1097, Shokaku separated Daigo-ji Temple into the upper and lower parts of the mountain, so that in 'Kami-Daigo (the upper part of Daigo),' where Seiryu Gongen is said to have descended; at the front of the Daigo-sui spring stands 'Seiryu-gu Haiden,' a national treasure, which was built during the Muromachi period, and in 'Shimo-Daigo (the lower part of Daigo),' which is at the foot of Mt. Daigo-san, stands 'Seiryu-gu Honden,' a national important cultural property.
According to Buddhism and Hinduism, Enma is the master of Hell.
He is also considered to be a deity.
It is believed that Enma, being the king of a permanent dreamland, has the authority to judge the crimes committed by the dead while in life.
Enma is a transliteration of Yama in Sanskrit and Pali.
He is also called Yama-rāja (rāja means "king").
The transliteration is Enmaraja, and the free translation is Enma Daio (great king Enma).
His name is abbreviated as Enra, Enra-o, En-o or En.
Yama (Emma) is translated into Japanese as baku (縛), sosei (雙世), soo (雙王), seisoku (静息), shasei (遮正) or byodo(平等), etc.
Such Japanese translations are derived from the respective meaning of Chinese character, namely "Baku (縛)," which means capturing criminals, "sosei (雙世)," which means always suffering the consequences of pain and joy; "soo (雙王)," which means a king consisting of a paired brother and sister, and "byodo (平等)," which means the fair judgment of criminals.
Faith in various regions
He was a deity that originated in the era when India and Persia were unified; he has the common origin with saintly king Yima of Avesta.
According to the "Rig-Veda," Yama is considered to be the human ancestor because the human race was born of Yama and his sister Yami; he became the king of the world of the dead because he was the first human being to die.
He is believed to live in the deepest recesses of emptiness.
In ancient India, those who performed benefactions in life were believed to go to Yama's country out in heaven.
Sometimes he was identified with "death," but generally he was perceived as the king of the paradise of the dead or the deity that dominates ancestors residing in the universe after death.
Later, it was believed that he wore yellow vesture and a wreath on his head, held a rope for arrest, bound the soul of the dead with this rope and brought them to the place where he resided.
Further, he became being perceived as a dreadful deity who dominated the lower world, judged the dead and threw them into Hell; eventually, he became a being depicted simply as Death.
He is accompanied by 'Turdak,' the devil of deadly disease, who has the form of a skeleton.
In contemporary India he is depicted as the one who has blue skin and is riding on a buffalo (although his skin is black-colored in nature, he is depicted as blue-colored due to the artistic style).
It is generally believed that he was incorporated into Buddhism later and was deemed to be the king of Hell.
However, one theory holds that the same deity, Yama of Rig-Veda, diverged into two genealogies.
These two genealogies are as follows;
One went to a black world in a lower realm and became the king of Hell.
This section describes Enma.
The other went to a bright world in an upper realm and became Yamaten, the third heaven of the six heavens in the realm of desire in Buddhist cosmology, or Enmaten.
However, some people believe these two were basically unrelated but might have been confused because 閻魔 (Enma) is Yama while 夜摩・焔摩 (Yama/Enma) is Yaama or Yaamaa.
China
After he was introduced in China, he became amalgamated with Taizanfukun (Taishanfuzhun), who were associated with the Taoist philosophy of a permanent dreamland.
Eventually, he was linked to the faith of Juo (Ten Kings) by the bogus sutra called "Enra-o-juki Shishu Gyakushu Shoshichiojo Jodo-kyo Sutra" (abbreviated as "Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra, Yuxiu Shiwang Shengdijing Sutra"), which was compiled in the era of the late Tang dynasty and became the object of faith as one of the judges of Hell, whose role was to judge persons after death.
His well-known figure, clothed in the familiar vestments of a Tang official, was established at that time.
Japan
Regarding Japanese Buddhism, Jizo Bosatsu, which was later deemed to be the honji (substance) of Enma, had been introduced in the Nara period through "Jizojurin-kyo Sutra."
However, it did not become widespread under the social situation in which worldly interest was prioritized.
In the early Heian period when Mappo-shiso (the "end of the world" belief) prevailed, it was expounded by the monk Genshin and others to the nobility in the early Heian period and then widely to ordinary people in the late Heian period, and early in the early Kamakura period, "Jizo Bosatsu Hosshin Innen Juo-kyo Sutra" ("Jizojuo-kyo" for short), which was also a bogus sutra, was created based on Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra (Yuxiu Shiwang Shengqijing).
Thanks to the above, the theory that Jizo Bosatsu was the honji of Enma (although it is conceivable that the theory claiming that 'Jizo is Enma Daimao (Great Satan)') was derived from this fact, although the details aren't known; however, not only did faith in Jizo spread but faith in Juo did as well.
Enma is believed to be able to travel back and forth between Hell and the Pure Land.
As previously mentioned, Enmaten, one of the Juniten (twelve deities), is said to have the same origins as Enma.
While Enmaten was amalgamated with Enma-daio in China, the two were separately introduced into Japan, which might be the reason that the same was split into two.
When scolding a child who has told a lie, there is a folk tradition in Japan to say, 'I will ask Enma to yank out your tongue.'
Saiho-ji Temple Enma-do (official name is 'Gappo-ga-tsuji Enma-do Saiho-ji Temple') located in Naniwa Ward, Osaka City enshrines Enma.
It is said that the temple was built by Prince Shotoku and is the scene of 'Sesshu Gappo-ga-tsuji' (in Joruri (Japanese-type puppet play)).
The Gochi Nyorai, also known as Godai Nyorai, are five nyorai (tathagatas) associated with the five wisdoms of esoteric Buddhism (wisdom of the essence of the Dharma-realm, great perfect mirror wisdom, wisdom of equality, wisdom of wondrous observation, wisdom of accomplishing that which is to be done).
They are the Kongokai Gobutsu (Five Buddhas of the Diamond Realm).
Renowned depictions include statues at the lecture hall of To-ji Temple (Kyoo Gokoku-ji Temple) and Kyoto's Ansho-ji Temple.

According to Buddhism, Kechimyaku Sojo means the handing down of law (dharma) from a mentor to a disciple.
Nichiren, who was the founder of the sect, declared himself to be the reincarnation of Jogyo Bosatsu, who was directly bestowed Kecchofuzoku based on No. 21 of Nyoraijinrikihon of "Myohorenge-kyo" (Annex of "Mannen Kugo-honzon of December, 1274").
There are many other authorities.
Additionally, he asserted that he received Shingon Mikkyo's 'twenty-third chakuchaku (legitimate) sojo, as extended from Dainichinyorai to Nichiren' (from "Fudo Aizen Kankenki," a posthumous writing by Nichiren).
According to the description of "Risho-in Kechimyaku" of Daigo-ji Temple (collection of Kanazawa-Bunko), the name "Nichiren" appears twenty-fifth, and this position coincides with the name at the twenty-third position from Dainichinyorai; however, it is not clear whether "Nichiren" in "Risho-in Kechimyaku" and the founder are one and the same.
Since then, the sole inheritor of Kechimyaku Sojo has asserted the legitimacy of Nichiren Shoshu sect, and this position has been passed from the incumbent Hossu (chief priest) to his successor; the position itself guarantees absolute authority in controlling propagation activities, as well as the exclusive power to adjudicate on disputes concerning doctrine, to give permission for depicting the principal icon of a temple, and to bestow various titles.
Kechimyaku Sojo is often mystified by saying, for example, 'various elements that cannot be captured as objects (such as the attitude for faith, spirituality and accumulation of pious acts, etc.) are inherited by golden paper or through oral transmission.'
On the other hand, there is a simple understanding of Kechimyaku Sojo that its most essential core element exists only in the transfer of 'Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon' (principal image of the Nichiren Shoshu sect).
Depending on the times and circumstances, Kechimyaku Sojo could be done in the form of confidential affairs whose dissemination to the public would not be expected for some time to come.
It is said that in the past, Sojo from the third (Nichimoku) to the 4th (Nichido) and from the sixty-sixth (Nichidatsu) to the sixty-seventh (Nikken) was done in the form of confidential affairs, but some deny that regarding the case of Sojo to Nikken.
The Nichiren Shoshu sect asserts that only the chief priests of Taiseki-ji Temple inherited after Nichiren-Nikko-Nichimoku.
However, the Nichiren sect rebuffs the assertion of the Nichiren Shoshu sect on the following grounds:
If the assertion of the Nichiren Shoshu sect is true, it means that out of six old monks who were the disciples of the founder, five old monks who became anti Nikko were persons who had defamed the law (dharma); the question remains as to why the founder could not have predicted their behavior and acknowledged them as disciples.
Nika (two) Sojo, which consisted of two notes, 'Ikegami Sojo-sho' and 'Minobu Sojo-sho,' on which the Nichiren Shoshu sect's assertion is based, is bogus because it does not appear in the early record of Komon-ryu school.
Minobu Sojo is bogus because its date and the activities of Nichiren don't coincide.
Nika Sojo cannot even be the subject of discussion because it was stored at Omosu-dansho (an institute established in Omosu for the purpose of educating disciples; currently Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple), where Nikko lived after retirement, not at Taiseki-ji Temple which Nikko had ceded to Nichimoku, and because its original document is now missing.
As for the whereabouts of Nika Sojo, there are various assessments.
One view holds that it was completely lost due to looting by the army of Katsuyori TAKEDA.
The other view holds that it was not lost because there is a record that Ieyasu TOKUGAWA read the original copy and Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple is in fact storing it in confidence.
Traditionally, Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple has given little consideration to Kechimyaku Sojo.
From the very beginning, Nichidai, who was ceded Omosu by Nikko, was expelled by the people adherent to Omosu.
Naturally, the temple did not approve the transfer of Kechimyaku Sojo from Nikko to Nichimoku.
Currently, it even denies Nika Sojo and strives solely to preserve the status of the 'head temple of the Nichiren-shu sect.'
Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple did not approve Kechimyaku Sojo from Nikko to Nichimoku but instead split away, claiming the legitimacy of Nichidai based on "Hattsu Yuzurijo (eight notes that document the will to transfer the property or possession to the offspring or disciples)."
Hota Myohon-ji Temple and Koizumi Kuon-ji Temple did not approve Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichimoku to Nichido but instead split off, claiming the legitimacy of Nichigo.
They once came under the jurisdiction of Taiseki-ji Temple in 1957 but became independent again in the Heisei period after seeing the conflict between Soka Gakkai and the sect.
During the era of Nichizon, its original chief priest (of Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple) acknowledged Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichimoku to Nichido, and during the Edo period it turned out nine consecutive hossu as being the most overriding branch temple of Taiseki-ji Temple.
However, over the years it gradually became independent and dissolved the affiliation with Taiseki-ji Temple by denying Kechimyaku Sojo.
Currently, it is independent as the head temple of the 'Nichiren Honshu sect.'
Soon after the expulsion of five monks in 1980, Shoshin-kai filed court litigation requesting a confirmation of the non-existence of the position of the chief abbot (superintendent priest) on the grounds that Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichidatsu to Nikken doesn't appear to have been done, and that consequently the chief abbot in question lacked qualification.
Since then, it has continued to deny Kechimyaku Sojo in various respects, doing so as ammunition for attacking the Nikken and Nichiren Shoshu sects.
The litigation itself was dismissed on the grounds that the subject matter cannot be the subject of litigation because, like the problem of temple occupation, it is a matter of faith.
(A well-known judicial precedent concerning the legal theory of a partial society)
Recently, some monks have remarked that Kechimyaku Sojo from Nichidatsu to Nikken was done.
According to them, Kechimyaku Sojo was in fact performed but they had pretended otherwise as it provided ammunition for attack.
Since the excommunication in 1991, Soka Gakkai has asserted that Kechimyaku Sojo ended long ago.
After the headquarters instruction meeting held on April 12, 1999, Fuji Taiseki-ji Kensho-kai asserts, in the form of echoing the assertion of Shoshin-kai, that Nichidatsu could not bestow Kechimyaku Sojo to anyone because he had died suddenly as a consequence of Buddha's penalty relating to the change of doctrine.
It further asserts that Nikken assumed the position of Hossu by pretending that he had been bestowed Kechimyaku Sojo, even though it had not occurred.
Koen OTANI (February 27, 1875 - February 6, 1943) was a Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) monk who was the 23rd Hossu (head priest) of the Otani School of the Jodo Shinshu.

Koen OTANI studied traditional Japanese painting under Bairei KONO and Seiho TAKEUCHI, was influenced by Shiki MASAOKA and commented on in the magazine "Hototogisu" by Hekigoto KAWAHIGASHI and Kyoshi TAKAHAMA who he admired and looked up to.
He later broke from the influence of "Hototogisu" and followed his own path.
During his lifetime, he wrote many haiku poems (approximately 20,000) and used his poetic talent to forge his own reputation within the haiku world.
He is affectionately known as Kubutsu Shonin (meaning 'one who uses haiku poetry to praise Buddha').

Originally, Gozu Tenno (gośīrşa) was an Indian deity and the guardian deity of Gion-shoja (the Jetavana monastery).
Later on, he amalgamated with the Japanese deity Susanoo.
When the term "Tenno" alone is used, it usually means Gozu Tenno.
Although he has the horns of ox on his head and looks like Yasha (a class of semi-divine being usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified with malignant spirits), his figure resembles that of a human being.
As mentioned above, he is perceived as the guardian deity of Gion-shoja but he also is perceived as the suijaku (trace manifestation) of Yakushi-nyorai of Joruri-sekai (the realm known as Joruri or Pure Lapis Lazuli in the eastern quarter, Sk: Vaiduryanirbhasa).
He is also said to be a deity stemming from Ox-head Mountain of Shiragi (the Silla dynasty).
According to the extant "Bingonokuni Fudoki (ancient records of culture and geography of Bingo Province)" included in "Shaku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japanese History)," he was a prince of Buto Tenjin, his name was written as Gozu Tenno, he married a daughter of Shakara Ryuo, one of the Hachidai Ryuo (Eight Dragons) and he had eight princes.
In Japan, he amalgamated with Susanoo as he was a deity of ferocious nature and was enshrined at Yasaka-jinja Shrine in Gion, Kyoto and was worshiped as Joeki-shin (a god that protects against plague).
He is said to be a deity who has concurrently the aspect of Yakubyo-gami (a deity of the transmission of epidemics).
It is said that although he spreads diseases, he bestows remedies for all diseases on farmers who welcome him kindly.
During the Heian period, people in urban areas started to worship him and he became the object of worship in Gion Goryo-e (the Gion Matsuri Festival).
The faith for Gozu Tenno and Susanoo, which is the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism, is called Gion veneration, which had spread nationwide by the Medieval period.
He was enshrined at Hiromine-jinja Shrine, Yasaka-jinja Shrine, Tsushima-jinja Shrine, Hikawa-jinja Shrine and their branch shrines, but subsequent to the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the Meiji period, these shrines have became shrines to Susanoo.
However, in Nara, Kyoto and Niigata prefectures and others nationwide, there still are several shrines, including Tenno-jinja Shrine, that enshrine Gozu Tenno.
Many of the place names that include the word 'Tenno,' such as 'Tennoz Isle,' are derived from Gozu Tenno.
Once upon a time, Gozu Tenno went on a journey in the disguise of an old man and asked for lodging at a certain village.
On this occasion Kotanshorai, the wealthy younger brother, treated Gozu Tenno coldly, but the elder brother, Sominshorai, despite being poor, welcomed and entertained Gozu Tenno kindly.
Then, Gozu Tenno disclosed his identity and declared, 'In the near future, mortal disease will run rampant in this village, but I will save your family members.'
As predicted by him, when mortal disease rampaged the village, all the family members of Kotanshorai died but those of Sominshorai survived.
Even today, Yasaka-jinja Shrine and other shrines distributes red paper cards with "Sominshorai shison-no-mon" written on them in gold-colored characters, and the origin of this practice is the historical event mentioned above.
The reason for having gold-colored characters on red paper is that, according to Onmyo-do (the way of yin and yang), it is believed that 'these colors are what Yakubyo-gami detests.'
Kujaku Myoo is an object of worship in Buddhism and one of the Myoo (king of wisdom) having venerable status specific to Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism).
She is believed to represent the dharma of benefit to living things.
Originally, she was Mahamayuri, an Indian goddess, and one of the Pancharakshya (five protector deities).
Sanskrit name Mahamayuri means 'great peacock.'
She is also called Makamayuri, Kujaku Butsumo, Kujaku Omo Bosatsu or Konjiki kujaku-o.
Although the characteristic of Myoo is a fierce facial expression, she has only a Bosatsu-style face expressing mercy.
Usually, she is depicted as the one that is riding a peacock and has one face and four arms.
The four hands are holding Guen-ka, Kichijo-ka (auspicious fruit), lotus and a peacock's tail, respectively.
There are some images, such as the painting image at Ninna-ji Temple in Kyoto (the Northern Song Dynasty period, a national treasure), that have three faces and six arms.
Because a peacock eats bugs and poisonous snakes like cobra, Kujaku Myoo was believed to do the 'pious act of removing plague or pain from people' and therefore became an object of faith.
Later on, the interpretation that Kujaku Myoo performs the pious act of accomplishing Buddhism by eating poisonous living matter, in other words by eating the three kleshas that poison the heart of man (desire, ill will and ignorance), which symbolize the bonno (earthly desires) of human beings that had become prevalent; there are many sects that chant Shingon (mantra) of Kujaku Myoo at the rite as a charm against evil spirits.
Further, it was believed to have the ability to predict rainfall and was therefore used on certain occasions as a ritual for rain.
The incantation of Mikkyo that uses Kujaku Myoo as the principal image is called Kujakukyoho.
In the world of Shingon Mikkyo, the prayer of Kujakukyoho was emphasized the most as it was deemed to be a prayer to guard the nation.
Sutra: Daikujaku-myoo-kyo Sutra (Butsubo-daikujaku-myoo-kyo Sutra) and Daikujaku-myoo Gazodanjojiki
In Japan there is a record stating that she was worshiped during the Nara period, and her image was placed at the newly constructed Saidai-ji Temple Kondo (Saidai-ji Temple Golden Hall).

Jocho (D.O.B. unknown - died September 2, 1057) was a sculptor active in the latter part of the Heian period and is said to be the sculptor who perfected the technique called yoseki-zukuri, in which the main part of a statue is made out of two or more pieces of wood.
Son of the sculptor Kosho.
The shallow sculpting of the drapery with folds arranged in parallel lines, and the serene expressions of Jocho's simple and graceful Buddhist statues suited the preferences of the Heian aristocracy and this style was called 'Buddhist Style.'
According to historical accounts there is much evidence of his work however the only statue in existence that can be identified with certainty as his work is the wooden seated Amida Nyorai Statue (a national treasure), the principal object of reverence at Byodoin (Kyoto).
While examples of work in the Jocho style of sculpture came to be formalized, this Amida statue is a superb work which is highly acclaimed as a representative work of Jocho.
Buddhist statues ascribed to Jocho remain in existence around the country.
There is also a sculpture of a Jizo Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) in a temple in Wakayama Prefecture which is ascribed to Jocho.
According to Buddhism, Komokuten (viruupaakSa in Sanskrit) is the Buddha of Tenbu (deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another).
It is one of the Shitenno (the Four Guardian Kings) together with Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra), Zochoten (Virudhaka) and Tamonten (Vaisravana).
Although original meaning of Virupaksa in Sanskrit was 'the one who has various eyes' or 'the one who has awkward eyes,' such meaning was stretched to 'extraordinary eyes that have particular abilities' and was eventually interpreted as second sight and translated as "komoku (wide eyes)."
His sanmayagyo (symbol) is a sankogeki (a long, three-pronged spear) and kenjaku (a rope made from five different colored strands--blue, yellow, red, black and white--with clasps at both ends).
Shushi (Esoteric Buddhism) is vi.
His figure is depicted in various ways, but in Japan he is generally depicted as a leather-armored warrior of the Tan Dynasty period.
In the old days he was depicted as a figure writing something on a scroll with a brush.
However, most of such figures were created in the Tenpyo period, and since Heian period figures holding items other than the above gradually became more prevalent.
For example, in the Garbha-mandala of Mikkyo he is depicted as having a red-colored body, with right hand holding Sankogeki (a three-pronged pike) and the left hand clenched and placed on the right side of the waist.
Sometimes he is depicted as a figure holding kenjaku.
In Chinese folk belief he is depicted as a figure with a red-colored face and holding a dragon.
Originally, he served under the thunder god Indra (Taishakuten), who appears in Indian mythology, but later he was introduced in Buddhism as a guardian deity.
As one of the Shitenno that guard the four sides of Mt. Shumisen、which support the world where Buddha resides, he resides in Hakuginta and was believed to guard its west side or Saigokeshu, one of four continents on the earth believed to exist in the ancient Indian view of the world.
He has fierce gods such as Naga and Pishaca as subordinates.
The term Sohei means samurai (warriors) with the appearance of priests who were active from the Medieval Period until the early modern ages.
Summary
Hoshi-musha or armed priests were called Soshu or Akuso in the era when they were active but since the Edo period, they have been called "Sohei."
Incidentally, the Chinese character of "悪(aku)" used for the term of 悪僧 (Akuso), like 悪 (aku) used for 悪党 (akuto) means "strong."
They basically belonged to temples as armed groups.
Their figures were depicted in picture scrolls and their characteristics were cloth covering heads, Takageta (tall wooden clogs) and Naginata (halberd).
It is highly possible that they didn't shave their heads.
In the meantime, armed groups belonging to shrines were called Jinin.
As there were Buddhist priests' groups outside of Japan that organized priests into armed groups, such as Suzan Shorin-ji Temple (Mountain Sung Shaolin Temple), the term Sohei sometimes refers to such armed religious groups in broad terms.
When used in this sense, the Military Order in Europe is also included in the category of Sohei.
During the era when Sohei or Jinin were active, temples and shrines were rich due to holding vast Jiryo (landownership of Buddhist Temples) or Shrine Estates amidst the unstable society and they faced risks of being assailed by various social groups, including groups of robbers.
For this reason, the need to have military power for defending temples and shrines from such attacks arose.
In this historic context, 'arming of temples and shrines,' although it seemingly sounds contradictory, was in fact promoted.
Historically, Daishu (Doshu), those who belonged to big temples in Kyoto and Nara City and were engaged in odd jobs, and armed themselves for self-defense and became Sohei.
During the late Heian period, Sohei became powerful armed groups with their stronghold including at Kofuku-ji Temple, Enryaku-ji Temple, Onjo-ji Temple and Todai-ji Temple and were repeatedly involved in power struggles among temples or in acts of menace to the imperial court and Sekke (line of regents and advisers).
In Mochihito-o War, Sohei also fought against the Taira family.
Such a fight against the Taira family is depicted in "Heike Monogatari" (The Tale of the Taira family).
Sohei belonging to Kofuku-ji Temple (Nanto, southern capital) and Enryaku-ji Temple (Hokurei) were specifically called Shuto (Nara-hoshi) and Yama-hoshi respectively.
Emperor Shirakawa cited 'water of the Kamo River (flow of Kamo-gawa River), cast of sugoroku and Yama-hoshi (Mt. Hiei)' as being beyond his control and from this anecdote, it can be guessed that the high-handedness of the Sohei was a worry for the imperial court.
Even in regions far from the center of Japan, some dominant temples and shrines exerted a big influence on the power balance in those days with holding military power or by joining forces with the local militia.
It is well- known that during Jisho-Juei War, both sides made political deals with Kumano Gongen Deity that presided over Kumano Suigun Navy.
In the Muromachi period, Yoshinori ASHIKAGA, who was formerly known by Gien and had once been a temple head priest of the Tendai sect, was familiar with the military power and high-handedness of Sohei to conduct massive military operations in order to crack down on Enryaku-ji Temple (Nobunaga conducted similar operations later).
After that, such trend of those dominant temples and shrines in various regions to hold military power continued.
The following are examples of powerful Sohei groups during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
Kofuku-ji Temple; Inei, the founder of the Hozoin school of Sojutsu (the art of the spearman ship), was well-known.
Negoro-ji Temple; it was well-known for its mighty harquebus corps including Kazunaga TSUDA, the founder of Tsuda school of gunnery.
It was subdued by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI by his expedition to Kishu and lost military power.
Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple; it boasted overwhelming influential power as well as military power through Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers) which was fought by, instead of its own Sohei group, believers called up from every region of the country (many of them were indigenous persons and ordinary people), but eventually it suffered devastating defeat in the Ishiyama War and lost its military power.
Suwa-taisha Shrine; it was subdued by Shingen TAKEDA and lost military power.
It was rebuilt as the line of the feudal lord but was split from that of the Shinto priest.
Usa-jingu Shrine; it was subdued by Yoshishige OTOMO and lost military power.
Since all temples and shrines mentioned above had either lost their military power or had been divided, their religious powers had been separated from the military powers by the Edo period.
Rinno-ji Temple on Mt. Nikko; it held many Sohei and was one of the leading armed groups in Shimotsuke Province.
Because it joined forces with the Gohojo clan, it was oppressed by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI to be forfeited its Jiryo, then declined.
Later, it recovered its clout under the protection of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA who had been transferred to Kanto.
Tanzan-jinja Shrine; it often clashed with Kofuku-ji Temple.
In 1585, it accepted the disarmament request made by Hidenaga TOYOTOMI when he came to Yamato Province and surrendered weapons.
Heisen-ji Temple Hakusan-jinja Shrine; as the branch temple of Enryaku-ji Temple, it held eight thousand Sohei and extended its power to Echizen Province.
In 1574, it was burnt down in the battle against Ikko Ikki.
It was declined thereafter.
However, by allying itself with Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI from early on, it recovered its Jiryo.
Rokudo is a Buddhist term and it means six posthumous worlds to which the souls of the dead transmigrate.
The six worlds that constitute Rokudo are as follows.
Jigoku-do (world of hells)
Gaki-do (world of hungry ghosts)
Chikusho-do (world of animals)
Shura-do (world of bellicose demons)
Ningen-do (world of humans)
Ten-do (world of heavenly beings) (also called Tenjo-do or Tenkai-do)
According to Buddhism, it is believed that stray lives that came in to the world will transmigrate after death to one of six posthumous world depending on the crimes they committed while alive and repeat life and death in each of the Rokudo where they transmigrated (Rokudo-rinne, Rebirth in the Six Worlds).
Even those transmigrated to Ten-do cannot escape from the rebirth of pain.
Based on the principle that all things are in flux and nothing is permanent, it is believed that lives are destined to die out eventually and transmigrate to another world (or the same world) regardless of the world to which they transmigrated.
Under the world view of Shumisen (Mt. Sumeru), the six worlds mentioned above are sometimes understood as space.
Those lives that deviated from the road of the wheel of life, such as Tengu (braggart), are commonly called Gedo (Maen).
In the picture depicting the wheel of life, such as the one shown in upper right,
monster and skeleton represent ignorance (Mumyo) and uncertainty regarding the root of the Twelve-fold Chain of Dependent Origination,
the outer circular ring represents human behavior (omen),
the second circular ring represents Rokudo (in this picture, heavenly beings, human beings and Ashura occupy the same place),
the inner circular ring represents human beings, and
the circle in the middle represents wrath (symbolized by snakes) that is the cause of pain, folly (pigs) that represents ignorance and greed (birds)
respectively.
In connection with Rokudo, the belief of afterlife that souls are saved from the world to which they transmigrated by the guidance of Kannon (Deity of Mercy), called Kannon belief, was generated and it was believed that six different Kannon bear respective roles.
These are called Roku Kannon (the six Kannon).
Tendai sect and Shingon sect adopt different interpretations concerning Ningen-do and Fukukensaku Kannon (Kannon of the Never Empty Lasso) and Jundei Kannon (Cundi) are adopted, respectively.
When called Shichi Kannon (the seven Kannon), these two Kannon are included.
Rokudo
Roku Kannon in Shingon sect
Roku Kannon in Tendai sect
Jigoku-do; Sho-Kannon (Sacred Kannon, or Aryavalokitesvara); Sho Kannon
Gaki-do; Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Kannon, or Thousand Armed Avalokiteshwara); Senju Kannon
Chikusho-do; Bato Kannon (horse-headed Kannon); Bato Kannon
Shura-do; Juichimen Kannon (Eleven-faced Kannon); Juichimen Kannon
Ningen-do; Jundei Kannon; Fukukensaku Kannon
Ten-do; Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion); Nyoirin Kannon
Nirvana, which means awakening to Buddha through Satori (enlightenment), can be achieved while in life, and is not necessarily triggered simply by death.
Nirvana is a fundamentally different notion from the phenomenon of posthumous transmigration and as represented by Shaka, human beings can live in the same world as before until their death even after awakening to Buddha since no special world is prepared for Buddha.
Compared with Rokudo, nirvana can be understood as a more psychological notion.
Historically, the pure land philosophy that is held by Jodo-kyo etc. was established long after the establishment of Rokudo-rinne philosophy.
The pure land is common with Rokudo in the sense of a place where the dead are destined to go, but it is a completely different notion from the world-view under the philosophy of Rokudo-rinne.
The pure land can be defined as the world where Buddha resides and is not limited to one of the Rokudo.
Ten-do
Ten-do is the world where Tenjin (heavenly beings) reside.
Tenjin are believed to have very long life-spans and be better and far less pain than human beings.
Tenjin are also believed to be able to fly in the sky and spend a life of pleasure.
But Tenjin are not relieved from Bonno (earthly desires).
When Tenjin are dying, it is believed that five changes occur.
These changes are called Gosui (Tenjin Gosui) and when such changes occur, they stink with their body being covered in grime, they sweat from the underarms, they become less fond of the place where they reside and flowers on their heads wither.
Ningen-do
Literally, Ningen-do is the world where Ningen (human beings) reside.
Although it is a world with so much pain, it is believed that pleasure may come after a succession of pain.
There is also relief that those can become a Buddha.
Shura-do
Shura-do is the world where Shura reside.
Shura are believed to fight and struggle all the time.
Although it is a world where pain and anger are constantly rampant, it is not a hellish place and pain can be largely attributed to oneself in this world.
Chikusho-do
Chikusho-do is the world where oxen and horses reside.
As oxen and horses live almost solely with instinct and are forced to work by human beings, they are unable to attain Buddha's teaching by themselves and in this sense, this world is believed to be of less relief.
Gaki-do
Gaki-do is the world where Gaki (preta) reside.
Gaki have the appearance of a demon with a bloated belly and they always suffer from hunger and thirst because food becomes ash when they are set to eat.
There is an example of a person who was thrown into this world because he didn't care for other people while in life..
Segaki-e (hungry ghosts' feeding rites) is held on July 15 of lunar calendar in order to save these Gaki.
Jigoku-do
Jigoku-do is the world for making human beings atone for crimes committed during their life.
Refer to Jigoku (Buddhism) for details.
Concerning the above six worlds, Jigoku, Gaki and Chikusho are sometimes collectively called San-akushu (literally, three bad realms, San-akudo, Sanaku or Sanzu) and Shura, Ningen and Ten are collectively called San-zenshu (literally, three good realms).
Jigoku, Gaki, Chikusho and Shura are sometimes collectively called Shi-akushu (literally, four good realms).
Further, Rokudo other than Shura are sometimes collectively called Goshu (literally, five realms).
Under early Buddhism, Jigoku, Gaki, Chikusho, Ningen and Ten were collectively called Goshu and Shura did not exist.
Therefore, Goshu is deemed as an older notion than Rokudo.
Originally, Shura (Ashura) was included in Tenbu (Deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another) but after Mahayana Buddhism was established, Shura derived from Tenbu and became Rokudo.
Therefore, these two notions are collectively called Five Realms Six Paths.
Rokudo originated from ancient Indian philosophy before the establishment of Buddhism and did not have a significant meaning in early Buddhism.
It is perceived that systematization proceeded at a later stage in history.
Although not originating from India or China, Roku Jizo (six Jizo Bodhisattva) which are allocated in each Rokudo, were enshrined throughout Japan in the 11th century and widely worshipped by ordinary people.
We will introduce two kinds of Shojin ryori here; one are Shojin ryori derived from Buddhism and the other are Shojin ryori that are categorized as one of Japanese cuisine.
Shojin ryori mean vegetarian diet which are prepared as the charity for monks using only vegetables, beans and grain since the five commandments of Buddhism prohibit monks from killing and under Mahayana Buddhism, even meat eating is prohibited.
Summary
Under early Buddhism in India, three kinds of pure meat, other than the ten kinds of meat that the commandments of Hinayana prohibited, were allowed to be eaten (called the 3 meats of Kenbungi).
In this case, monks were allowed to eat either the meat of animals if they had not seen the slaughter, meat of animals which they didn't know were slaughtered for them, or meat of animals with no suspicion of the above two case, and the production of dairy products was also allowed as Shaka attained enlightment while receiving the charity of chyle.
Currently, in countries with Theravada Buddhism, such as Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, Shojin ryori which vegetable is mainly served have not developed since monks are allowed to eat three kinds of pure meat (the notion of Shojin ryori itself exists).
On the other hand, Mahayana Buddhism prohibited meat eating itself later on and therefore, vegetarian dishes have developed in cultural areas of Buddhism including China and Japan.
In China and Tibet, however, use of eggs and dairy products are sometimes allowed and no clear standards exist.
(It seems to have been thought in Japan that drinking milk was equivalent to killing because milk is supposed to be drunk by calves)
Although there are some people among the believers of Hinduism and Jainism in India who eat only vegetables as a practice of ahimsa, the term of Shojin ryori is basically used in connection with Buddhism.
Characteristics
One of the characteristics of Shojin ryori is the necessity for time-consuming precooking such as removing harshness and boiling because precooking had been required for vegetables and beans until the practice of eating fresh vegetables as a la cart cuisine, namely salad, took root in Japanese food culture.
These complex cooking techniques and notion of foodstuffs exerted a large effect on many cooks, as well as cooking scholars, and contributed to the development of the overall field of cooking.
Further, as the cooking of Shojin ryori required use of simple foodstuffs under a lot of constraints, the necessity for various primary and secondary processing is also one of their characteristics.
Thanks to this background, together with the objective of long storage and not tiring people, fermented soybean paste, soy sauce, soybean curd, dried bean curd, soybean milk, natto (fermented soybean) and deep-fried bean curd were created.
These techniques were developed and accumulated by temples which required Shojin ryori, as well as by the nearby residents.
Another example is so-called 'Modoki' cuisine which is seen especially in China.
This is a cooking technique to make cuisine resemble animal-derived food with the use of vegetable origin materials.
For example, making ham-like food by processing dried bean curd (Chinese ham), shaping prawns or cuttlefish using konjac or making something like abalone soup or fried abalone using shiitake or other mushrooms.
Shojin ryori were indispensible food for monks, and taking meals was emphasized as part of ascetic training.
At the same time, Shojin ryori were also cooked by private citizens in homes or restaurants on ceremonial occasions or during the Bon festival.
Shojin ryori at restaurants are sometimes cooked with the aim of providing dainty food that is in contradiction to the Buddhist notion of a meal.
In China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, there are many restaurants and Japanese-style restaurants whose specialty is Shojin ryori.
Japanese Shojin ryori
It is believed that Shojin ryori already existed in Japan when Buddhism was introduced, but full-fledged development started in Kamakura period.
Especially, the introduction of the Zen sect during the Kamakura period contributed to the development of Shojin ryori.
Before the Heian period, Japanese cuisine, although using fish and birds as ingredients, did not have much taste and required after-cooking seasoning to eat and in this sense, it was undeveloped cuisine.
On the contrary, Shojin ryori of the Zen sect, although their ingredients were vegetable in origin, had strong taste and warriors and ordinary people who had to drive themselves and needed to take supplemental salt, were satisfied with such strong tastes.
Seasoning, cooking devices and cooking techniques used for Shojin ryori, like fermented soybean paste, earthenware mortar and Nishime (traditional Japanese stewed meal) with root vegetables, were introduced into Japanese cuisine.
Foodstuffs like been curd, freeze-dried bean curd, konjac and Hama-natto (Shiokara-natto) are thought to have been introduced as indispensible foodstuffs for Shojin ryori.
Under the Soto sect in Zen sect, cooking and the taking of meals is especially emphasized because of the anecdote that when Dogen, its founder, went to Sung (Dynasty) to study Buddhism and met with the temple chef of Mt. Aikuo, he learned of their daily activities, including cooking and taking of meals, which represent the substance of Bendo ascetic training.
After returning from Sung, Dogen wrote "Tenzo Kyokun" (Instructions for the Monastery Chief Cook) and "Fushukuhanpo" (The Dharma for Taking Food) which are said to be the origin of Shojin ryori of the Eihei-ji Temple school.
At Eihei-ji Temple, preparing meals is one important part of ascetic training and Tenza, a chef responsible for Kuin (Kitchen), is a member of the senior monks.
In the Edo period, the Obaku sect, one of the Zen sect, was introduced from China following the decline of the Ming Dynasty.
Chinese-style Shojin ryori were then introduced (so-called Sosai) and are called Fucha-ryori cuisine.
A unique style of eating, namely four persons sit around a table (rectangular table) and share food served on big plates, dish by dish, and was regarded as a curiosity.
Many Chinese-style dishes, such as sauted vegetables called 'Unpen,' Goma-dofu (crushed sesame seeds boiled in water and chilled like tofu) and 'Modoki' cuisine (Kabayaki of yamaimo (Japanese yam)), are found in the category of Fucha ryori cuisine.
As sesame oil was used in Chinese-style cooking techniques, such as sauteing and frying, the use of oil in cooking which had not been prevalent in Japan, was promoted.
As "Fucha" means " diffusing tea," Fucha ryori cuisine contributed to diffuse Sencha (natural leaf tea).
Fucha ryori cuisine was enjoyed not only by monks at temples of the Obaku sect, but also by civilians, especially intellectual people, and was served at restaurants as a means of savoring exoticism, rather than Shojin ryori.
With the reciprocal effects of Shippoku cuisine (a delectable melange of Western, Chinese and Japanese cuisine)from Nagasaki, Fucha ryori cuisine in civilian society often used tablecloths, vitreous wine glasses and decanters that were precious at the time, and also other western tableware.
In the Edo period, a book that specialized in the cooking of Fucha ryori cuisine, "Fucha-ryori-sho," was published.
Although it was gradually Japanized, Fucha ryori cuisine was brilliant and lively compared with traditional Shojin ryori and contemporary Fucha ryori cuisine has developed to be unique, and one that has brilliant appearance.
In the Edo period, there were many restaurants that supplied Fucha ryori cuisine to temples as outside contractors or which cooked for writers and artists, with no relationship to Buddhist activities.
Shojin ryori of Daitoku-ji Temple, Kyoto, are examples of the former, and those of Hida Takayama are examples of the latter and both have created artistic dishes which are different from those of temples by reintroducing the technique of Kaiseki ryori (tea-ceremony dishes) that had been split off.
As described above, Shojin ryori exerted effects on Japanese cuisine and contributed to its development.
Shojin ryori of Eihei-ji Temple school are considered to be the origin of Honzen-ryori cuisine, which prevailed from the Muromachi period to the early Edo period.
Kaiseki ryori are also derived from Shojin ryori.
Although contemporary Kaiseki ryori (sometimes confused with Kaiseki cuisine (dishes served on an individual tray for entertaining guests) because of the same pronunciation in Japanese) is luxurious, the original one was plain, and used seasonable materials and adopted the spirit of Shojin ryori.
Fucha ryori cuisine was imported from China, although the cooking techniques of Chinese cuisine was Japanized, and food such as Kenchin-jiru soup, Noppei-jiru soup and simmered, sauted or fried food using powdered arrowroot became prevalent.
Other than the above, there is a practice of Tenshin (Chinese dumpling).
This practice was introduced from China during the Muromachi period and under this practice, buns with bean-jam filling, Yokan (sweet bean jelly), Udon (Japanese wheat noodles) and/or Japanese vermicelli were served.
Although this practice was originally prevalent only among nobilities and warriors, it diffused among ordinary people in the course of time and became the origin of the current practice of lunch.
Shojin ryori in contemporary Japan
There are quite a few Buddhist temples that lodge worshippers in the Shukubo (priest's quarters) and provide Shojin ryori with the aim of having them experience a part of the ascetic training of Buddhism.
There are many such temples among those belonging to the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect since worshipping is deemed to constitute the important part of faith under the doctrine of these sects.
Some Shukubo provide meals and lodging only.
There are many Shukubo at Zenko-ji Temple in Nagano Prefecture which lodge worshippers and many of them provide Shojin ryori for dinner.
Shojin ryori provided by these Shukubo vary from authentic ones, such as Honzen type cuisine, to modern ones similar to Kaiseki ryori (tea-ceremony cuisine).
On the other hand, many temples in Kyoto relied on outside restaurants for preparing Shojin ryori for important guests and as a result, advanced Shojin ryori are available at such nearby restaurants rather than at the temples.
Around Daitoku-ji Temple, there are some well-established restaurants that specialize in Shojin ryori.
The above is also applicable to Fucha ryori cuisine and there are many restaurants which serve Fucha ryori cuisine around Manpuku-ji Temple, the head temple of the Obaku sect.
Varieties of Fucha ryori cuisine range from the ones which are prepared at restaurants in the style of Kaiseki ryori (tea-ceremony cuisine), and are quite similar to Japanese cuisine, to the ones which are close to the original ones prepared at Zen temples in Nagasaki or the ones which are quite similar to Chinese cuisine that adopt contemporary Sosai (the fact that there are many ethnic Chinese among supporters of Zen temples in Nagasaki and they receive many visitors from China and Taiwan during the Obon festival, could be the background).
Kangiten (or Nandikesvara) (Ganapati in Sanskrit) is one of the tenbu, guardian deities that reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another, in Buddhism.
It is also called Daisho Kangi-jizaiten or Shoten.
Incidentally, 'Shoten' is often pronounced 'Shoden.'
It is depicted as a figure in which a man and a woman who have elephant heads and human bodies embrace one another.
It corresponds to Ganesa, Vinayaka or Nandikesvara in Sanskrit.
It was a child of Shiva in ancient India, and was originally a violent and evil god.
Regarding Ganesa in Hinduism, see the article, 'Ganesa.'
After it came to believe Buddhism, it became Goho Zenshin, a good deity protecting dharma (護法善神) and guarded Sanzen Sekai (the universe) and the three treasures of Buddha, Buddhism and priests at the head of 9,800 fierce gods.
From the perspective of Buddhism, a man of Kangiten was the first son of Daijizaiten (Mahesvara) and a fierce god who violated world, and was called 'Jozui-ma (常隋魔).' who always peered into people's emptiness.
A woman of Kangiten, who was an avatar of Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Bodhisattva), embraced a man and quelled his violation by invoking his feeling of enjoyment.
Many statues of Kangiten, which have elephant heads and human bodies with long elephant trunks, are expressed in Japan as a figure in which a man and a woman embrace each other face to face.
There are works that have only one body or those that have many arms (four or six), but they are rare.
The origin of the statue of a man and woman embracing is that Juichimen Kannon (Kannon with eleven faces) changed its figure to a heavenly maiden in order to quell the desire of Kangiten, who was originally a fierce god, and embraced him.
Because of this character of the statue, Kangiten is a Buddhist statue not usually shown to the public.
In Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) it is regarded as the principal image of Kangiten-ho (歓喜天法) （Shoten-ho (聖天法）), who prays for pious acts, but it is generally worshipped as a god of marital harmony and the blessing of a child.
Many statues of Kangiten are small statues placed in zushi, miniature shrines in which Buddhist images or rolls of sutras (kyo), are kept; they are made of metal because a mass is held by Yokuyu-ho (浴油法), placing it in oil.
The statue of Kangiten at Hokai-ji Temple in Kamakura City is a wooden statue over 150 cm tall and was beautifully made, so that it can be said to be a representative work among the Kangiten statues in Japan.
The mantra (shingon) is On Kiri (Ku) Gyaku Un Sowaka.
Although it is said that the first 'ku' (meaning "trouble" in Japanese) is often omitted in the sense of preventing trouble at the time of invocation, in Japan the part that is read as 'kiriku' is a corrupted form of the original sound, 'Furi-hi,' which is simply read as 'kiriku' in the Shingon sect and 'Kiri' in the Tendai sect.
Therefore, in the other Shingon litany there is a case in which the sound of 'Furi-hi' in Japan is pronounced like that, according to the particular sect.
Altarage
As the altar configuration for Kangiten, there is a candy called Kangi-dan or Kangi-gan.
It was a candy in India, but in Japan it means the altar configuration only for Kangiten and Bishamonten (Vaisravana).
There are various opinions on the ingredients and preparation, and it is said that there are 11 types such as honeydew, rum blossom and strawberry; there is also an opinion that there are different types according to the aims of prayers such as the defeat of evil (調伏) and for good health.
Currently, the method is to mix rice flour with water, roll into a flat rice cake, place red beans, dried persimmon and a medicinal material in it, and cook in oil.
Twist the edge so that it resembles the shape of a rum blossom.
It is placed with sake and Japanese radish as altar configuration in the Shoten-gu mass (Kangiten-gu mass).
The three main shotens in Japan
The three main shotens in Japan generally consist of the shotens of three temples, two of which are Honryu-inTemple (commonly called Matsuchiyama-Shoden) in the Taito Ward of Tokyo and Hozan-ji Temple (commonly called Ikoma-Shoten) in Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture; the third could be any one of Kangi-in Temple (commonly called Menuma-Shoden) in Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture; Ashigarasan Shoden-do Temple (commonly called Ashigara-Shoden) in Oyama-cho, Shizuoka Prefecture; Daifukuden-ji Temple (commonly called Kuwana-Seiten) in Kuwana City, Mie Prefecture; or Toraku-ji Temple (commonly called Toyooka-Shoten) in Toyooka City, Hyogo Prefecture.

Kuya or Koya (903 - September 11, 972) was a priest in the mid-Heian period.
He is called Amida-hijiri, Ichi-no-hijiri and Ichi-no-shonin, and is recognized as the founder of pure-land teachings (Jodo-kyo) among the people.
He became a priest at a provincial monastery in Owari Province.
Since his youth he had visited various provinces as a lay disciplinant, implemented social projects such as construction of roads, bridges and temples with reciting Myogo (Amida's name) of Namu Amidabutsu, and gathered followers widely without regard to their affluence or poverty.
In 938 he recommended Buddhist invocation in Kyoto.
In 948 he was given vows to follow the precepts by Ensho, the temple's head priest in Mt. Hiei-zan, but there is an opinion that he had a stronger relationship with Nara Buddhist society, particularly with the Sanron sect, as opposed to the Tendai sect.
In 951 he made some statues including Juichimen Kannon (Kannon with eleven faces) (which exists in Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple).
Additionally, he started to copy Kinji Dai-hannya-kyo Sutra in 950, and in 963 he held a mass for a large gathering of people on the shore of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system).
Through these activities he also deepened the relationship with aristocrats such as FUJIWARA no Saneyori.
He died at the age of 70 in Higashiyama Saiko-ji Temple (later Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple).
His disciples became pioneers of 'Nenbutsu-hijiri,' such as Koya-hijiri, who as practitioners of Jodo-kyo caused it to become widespread among the people after the medieval times, and this had a great influence on Ippen during the Kamakura period.
He is also admired as the founder of Odori Nenbutsu and Rokusai Nenbutsu (both of which mean "to recite Namu Amidabutsu while dancing"), but there is no evidence that Kuya himself practiced the so-called Odori-Nenbutsu.
According to "Kuya-rui," written by MINAMOTO no Tamenori, and "Nihon Ojo Gokuraku-ki," by YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane, there was a view that Kuya had descended from the Imperial Family (as an illegitimate child of the Emperor Daigo) during his life, but he did not voluntarily speak about his parents.
Rairyu SHIMOTSUMA (1552 - June 15, 1609) was a priest of the Otani family in the age of the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan).
He was a son of Shinrai SHIMOTSUMA and the father of Yorihiro SHIMOTSUMA (later Shigetoshi IKEDA, a lord of the Shingu-han domain (Harima Province).
It is said that he was familiar with politics and cultural affairs rather than military affairs among the priests of Hongwan-ji Temple's, and that he communicated with the merchants of Sakai through tea parties and so on.
In the Ishiyama War he gained fame on the battlefield against Akimoto HOSOKAWA, who was on Nobunaga ODA's side.
It is said that when Hongwan-ji Temple surrendered Nobunaga, he signed the peace treaty jointly.
However, when Kyonyo attempted to remain in Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple again the following year, Rairyu, who was an aide of Kyonyo, was scolded by Kennyo.
Later, he married a daughter of Tsuneoki IKEDA.
Ekei, of Ankoku-ji Temple, was a Zen priest and a Japanese feudal lord from the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan) to the Azuchi Momoyama period.
Ankoku-ji' is the name of the temple (Aki Province Ankoku-ji Temple Rishoto (Fudo-in)) of which he was the chief priest.
He was a diplomat priest of the Mori clan (a Zen priest who was in charge of negotiations for the warrior caste) and finally became a Japanese feudal lord while retaining his status as a priest.
There are various views on the year of his birth, so that some believe it was 1539 and others believe it was 1537.
There are also various views on his father, such as Nobushige TAKEDA of the Aki Takeda clan and Shigekiyo BAN, the husband of Motoshige TAKEDA's daughter of the same clan.
In 1541, when the Aki Takeda clan was subverted by the attack of Motonari MORI, he was led to safety by his followers and became a priest at the Ankoku-ji Temple (Fudo-in) in Aki Province.
Subsequently, he entered Tofuku-ji Temple in Kyoto and became a disciple of Jikuun Eshin.
As a priest he became the chief priest of Ankoku-ji Temple in Aki Province in 1574, and he also became the chief priest of Tofuku-ji Temple and Nanzen-ji Zen Temple, assuming the highest status among the central Zen temples.
In 1599 he made efforts to rebuild Kennin-ji Temple.
On the other hand, he became a diplomat priest of the Mori clan relatively early in life because the Mori clan had embraced Eshin, and succeeded in making peace with the Otomo clan in Bungo Province in 1570.
In 1582, while the Mori clan was encamped opposite Hideyoshi HASHIBA (Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI) at Takamatsu-jo Castle in Bichu Province (the Battle of Bichu Takamatsu-jo Castle), the Honno-ji Incident occurred and Nobunaga ODA was killed at Honno-ji Temple (the Honno-ji Incident).
At this time, Hideyoshi HASHIBA brought up the peace plan with respect to the Mori clan, but hid the fact, and Ekei, a diplomat priest, made up the peace plan.
He was regarded as having forecast Hideyoshi's future success and having willingly devised the peace plan, so that he gained the confidence of Hideyoshi.
He was praised by Hideyoshi because he was in charge of negotiations when the Mori clan formally entered service as a vassal of the Hideyoshi in January 1585.
For this reason he was given land of 23,000 goku in Iyo Province after the conquest of Shikoku, and was given land of 60,000 goku in Iyo Province after the conquest of Kyushu in 1586, so that he became an unusual Japanese feudal lord of the Toyotomi clan, retaining his status as a priest.
Moreover, he served Hideyoshi as an aide at the same time so that he was in charge as the bugyo (administrator) of land surveys and so on, as implemented at the order of Hideyoshi.
At the time of the Bunroku-Keicho War, he crossed the sea as a kenshi (inspector).
Among the Mori clan, Ekei was familiar to Takakage KOBAYAKAWA, who was the key figure in the pro-Hideyoshi group; however, after Takakage's death he was opposed to Hiroie KIKKAWA, a central figure in the Mori clan, just as the Kobayakawa clan was.
At the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he sided with the Western army through Mitsunari ISHIDA, who was familiar to him, and succeeded in making Terumoto MORI the commander in chief of the Western army.
At the Battle of Sekigahara on September 15 (old lunar calendar), he took up a line at the rear of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's force with Hidemoto MORI and Hiroie KIKKAWA, but he could not join the fight because Hiroie at the front line communicated with Ieyasu secretly and prevented Mori force's from participating in the battle.
After the defeat of the Western army, Ekei escaped but was captured by Nobumasa OKUDAIRA's military unit in Kyoto, and went to the guillotine as one of the leaders of the Western army at Rokujokawara (there is a view that the reason for his execution was that he brought the Mori clan into the Western army, though the Mori clan had not initially made clear its position as anti-Tokugawa).
He died at the age of 62.
He might also have been 64.
His kubizuka (a grave of his head) (首塚) lies in the garden of Kennin-ji Temple, and there is also a grave at Fudo-in Temple, in Hiroshima.
In the letter to Yamagata Echizen-no-kami (Lord of Echizen province) Harutada INOUE as of December 12, 1573, he wrote that 'Nobunaga's government will not continue for five or three years. He seems to become a court noble around next year. I think he will be subverted after that. Tokichiro (Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI) is really something.'
This letter has often been quoted as an anecdote to show Ekei's insight because he forecasted the downfall of Nobunaga ODA and the strong showing of his follower, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and as a result his expectations were proved to be correct.
The honzon (the principal object of worship) in Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism is the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon (usually called the Lotus Mandala).
Also known as the Honzon of Ichienbudaisoyo, it was drawn by Nichiren, the founding father of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, on a Japanese cinnamon tree and engraved by Izumi-ko Nipposhi.
It is characterized by the Nichiren mantra Namu Myohorenge-kyo at its center, with the Kao (a written seal) of Nichiren below it, prayers summoning various Buddhas surrounding it, images of the Four Guardians in its corners, and bonji (Sanskrit characters) for Fudo Myoo (god of wisdom and righteousness) and Aizen Myoo (god of love) on either side of it.
Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon has writings such as 'Honmonokaidan,' 'Ganshu Yashiro Kunishige' and 'Hokkekoshura Keihaku.'
Branch temples of Nichiren Shoshu enshrine a copy of the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon copied by the Hoshu as mandala Honzon, and followers receive a mandala, which is a copy of the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon copied by Taiseki-ji Temple priests (Hossu).
Nichiren Shoshu has decreed that the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon is said to be drawn by the founding father on October 12, 1279 as the Honzon of Kimyoeji, (enshrined in the Grand Head Temple, Taiseki-ji Temple Hoan-do) and considers it to be the true reason for the founding father's appearance.
The Great mandala Honzon based on the founding father's idea is sometimes called Monji mandala or Jikkai mandala by art lovers, but they are all branches and leaves of the tree trunk that is the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon.
The structure of the Honzon is with the opening phrase consisting of the Nichiren chant, 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' and the name of the shuso 'Nichiren' with hangyo (a seal) is written in unique, characteristic handwriting in the center as a column, with many names representing living things that are included in the Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind, starting from Shakamuni-butsu/Taho-nyorai on both sides, and Bodhisattva and gods, even to Devadatta in hell, surround it.
This image expresses, as Honzon Shichika no Sojo says, 'the opening in the center, Jikkai on either side, and all represent Nichiren,' and borrowing the image of a ceremony on the Ryozenejo, Jikkaigogu, Hyakkaisennyo, Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind are all expressed by Nichiren Dai-Shonin.
In other words, together with the central Namu Myohorenge-kyo and the Holy Entities of the Jikkai on both sides, it expresses the entire life of Nichiren Dai-Shonin
Therefore, the Dai-Shonin said 'Please believe in me because I poured my soul into the ink to write this.'
Each temple, facility and house of followers of Nichiren Shoshu have a Great mandala drawn by the founding father gifted by the Hoshu at that time or a mandala Honzon copied by historical Hoshu is enshrined, and it is without question thought that service to the Honzon should be done 'with the same feeling as waiting upon Nichiren Dai-Shonin himself in the flesh.'
The Honzon is the Enlightenment of a living Buddha, in other words, 'Honbutsu Nichiren Dai-Shonin' himself and at the same time, it connects the senses and boundaries of the founding father as a Ninhonzon into one, expressing the relationship of Ninho-iko (humans and law are melted into one).
This Honzon is known to express soul-searching training, in other words, the actual practical method for attaining enlightenment with one life rather than just the theory of the Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind that is the core of the Hoke-kyo Sutra being "Anyone can certainly become a Buddha" by working and chanting every morning and evening to this Honzon.
The second founding monk, Nikkyo, was strict in following the rules of Buddhism and declared all shrines of other sects as non-followers of Buddhism, but also left writings stating that worshipping should be allowed because upon fulfillment of wide distribution, all shrines and temples in Japan will have enshrined a Honzon.
This may be the reason why some shrines in the vicinity of Taiseki-ji Temple in Fujinomiya City Shizuoka Prefecture enshrine the Honson of Nichiren Shoshu as their sacred body.
There are two forms of the Honzon, 'Paper drawing Honzon' and 'Ita Honzon.'
Paper-drawn Honzon have a mounting and are in the form of a hanging scroll, with two types, 'Joju Honzon (Calligraphy-copied Honzon,' written by the Hoshu, and 'Katachigi Honzon,' which is a printed version of the mandala written by the Hoshu.
The paper-drawn Honzon owned by temples are all 'Joju Honzon,' the same as the 'Doshi Honzon' displayed during funerals.
The Honzon given to followers' homes are 'Katachigi Honzon' (there are also Special Katachigi Honzon), and devout followers can apply for a 'Joju Honzon' to the Grand Head Temple through their affiliated temple.
Ita Honzon' are all 'Joju Honzon.'
They are enshrined in each building of the Grand Head Temple and Main building (Hondo) of each temple, emulating the ' Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon,' with gold-plated characters on a board with a layer of black lacquer.
The cord of the Honzon is placed into the lotus pedestal before enshrinement.
Honzon generally have a gold-colored frame, such as the 'Oza-kawari Honzon' (copied by Nikkyo) enshrined in Taiseki-ji Temple Kyakuden (Taiseki-ji Temple), but some facilities have wooden Honzon while others have paper-drawn Honzon.
It should be added that the Jojuban Honzon and Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon do not have the same form.
Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon are shaped like a log sliced in half, which is not similar to the concept of a 'board.'
Additionally, the date of copying, the owning temple name, the enshrinement place, ganshu, name, etc. may sometimes be written on the side of the Honzon, and the Hoshu name of its copying and his hangyo (Kao) are also written at the bottom.
Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon is considered to be the true reason for the appearance of Nichiren and was drawn by Nichiren himself on October 12, 1279.
Next to Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon enshrined in Taiseki-ji Temple, Hoan-do, there is a kyuden (miniature shrine) enshrining a 3-sun statue of Nichiren called the First Buddha, which is made from a Japanese cinnamon and sculptured by Izumi-ko Nipposhi, when Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon was established and there is a story (legend) that Nichiren saw this and commented that 'it looks similar.'
Regarding the Honmonkaidan-no-Daigohonzon, there has been constant discussion by other sects on whether it is real or not.
The photograph in the title page of the book, 'Nichiren Shonin' published in 1911, was given to the author by Ichijo YUI.
It is difficult to see the details, but the opening phrase, Four Guardians and the Kao can be clearly determined.
From this appraisal, it has been pointed out to be similar to the mandala given by Zen in May 8, 1280.
Normally, Shishinden-gohonzon is the name of the Honzon in Fuji Taiseki-ji Temple and Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple.
However, the Honzon in Taiseki-ji Temple and Yobo-ji Temple are completely different.
The one in Taiseki-ji Temple is a paper-drawn Manadara with authentic writing by Nichiren on March 1280, and is described in the fifth volume of the Fujishu Gakuyoshu as 'named Shishinden-gohonzon,' and is a special Honzon that was given to the Emperor when he became a believer in Nichiren's Buddhism and to be kept in the Shishinden, Kyoto Imperial Palace.
Another legend has it that in the age of Nichiu, the ninth head of Taiseki-ji Temple, the Shishinden-gohonzon was engraved in a board to become a 'Substitute Gohonzon' while the honzon (Nichiren Shoshu) was hidden in a cave owned by the Ide family in Numazu for protection from burglars.
The name Shishinden-gohonzon has been a traditional name used for a long time, but at the Insect warding Buddhist ceremony in 2002, the sermon by Nikken, the sixty-seventh Taiseki-ji Temple head said, 'The name should be reconsidered and should be correctly called Shishisosho-no-gohonzon, or Shishidenju-no-gohonzon.'
The one in Yobo-ji Temple is a paper-drawn Manadara given to the Emperor at the Shishinden in 1756, but is considered not to be Nichiren's actual writing.
The Shishinden is part of the Kyoto Imperial Palace and was formerly the Emperor's living quarters.
Since the Emperor's Imperial Palace was moved to Tokyo, it has been under the management of the nation as a cultural asset and it is possible to visit it as a tourist attraction.
The Honzon kept at each temple and displayed at Makura-kyo, wakes, and funerals are 'Doshi Honzon' and is a Honzon for guiding the deceased to Ryozen Jodo for sokushin-joubutsu, and is also called the 'Sokushin-Jobutsu no gohonzon.'
In some cases, the Nokotsu-do in temples such as the Grand Head Temple Taiseki-ji Temple enshrine a Honzon.
The Honzon enshrined in a Nokotsu-do is a Doshi-Honzon for the same reason.
The enshrinement of a Honzon is normally in the form of only the Honzon itself, but some temples employ 'Goei-do style,' where a statue of Nichiren is enshrined in front of the Honzon as it is at the Goei-do (Taiseki-ji Temple) or the 'Separate Three Treasures style,' where the Honzon is in the center and on the left when facing the Honzon is a statue of Nichiren and on the right is a statue of Nikko as it is at the Kyakuden of Taiseki-ji Temple.
Nichiren Shoshu enshrines the Honzon in a Zushi.
It does not place ihai (ancestral tablets) in the Buddhist altar.
A white wooden ihai is used for the funeral but when Nokotsu is performed during the Day 57 or Day 77 ceremony, it is put into the Kako-cho (death register) and the white wooden ihai is given to the temple.
Therefore, the morning and evening Buddhist religious services are performed while looking at the Kako-cho to offer prayers for the deceased.
The Buddhist altar for Nichiren Shoshu is quite different in structure from altars for other sects because it has a Zushi in its inner side.
Some household altars have copied the Zushi in temples.
Followers never place ihai in their altars but the Daikodo at Taiseki-ji Temple have ihai of Nikko and Nichimoku.
This is considered to express Nichiren observing the preaching disciples, Nikko and Nichimoku, who heard Nichiren preach and are directly descended from him.
Sandaihiho (the Three Great Secret Dharmas) comprises the fundamental dharmas in Buddhism by Nichiren and consists of Honmon no Honzon (the Object of Veneration of the Essential Teachings of the Lotus Sutra), Honmon no Kaidan (the Platform for the Receipt of the Precepts and Place of Practice of the Essential Teachings of the Lotus Sutra) and Honmon no Daimoku (the Sacred Title of the Essential Teachings of the Lotus Sutra).
It has been described in "Hoon-sho," "Hokke-shuyo-sho," "Sandaihiho-sho" and so on.
Formally, it is called 'Hokke Honmon-no-Sandaihiho (法華本門の三大秘法).'
It means the Homon (dharma gate), which is secretly embedded within key sentences in the Hoke-kyo Sutra.
As opposed to Goko-han (五綱判) (Shukyo-no-Goka (宗教の五箇)), which focuses on the relative advantage of the sect as compared to other sects, Sandaihiho is called Shushi-no-Sanka (宗旨の三箇) and is generally understood as a principle of transcending and resolving all conflicts from the viewpoint of absolute mercy.
Each Hokke sect interprets it differently, but the following interpretations of the Nichiren sect and Nichiren Shohu sect are representative examples for both ends of the spectrum.
Honmon no Honzon': Honmon no Honzon is a Buddha, specifically Sakyamuni in Gaya Jodo (伽耶成道), who has recognized himself as Nyorai throughout the eternal past, which is written in "Juryo-bon" (a part of the sutra).
Honmon no Kaidan': The place where Daimoku (Namu Myohorenge-kyo) is recited in front of the Honzon (principal image) is known as the "dojo," a place for training (Sokuzedojo (即是道場)).
Honmon no Daimoku': Namu Myohorenge-kyo, which is The Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind of enlightenment by Sakyamuni.
According to the mainstream thinking (such as that of the Icchi-ha sect), these are regarded as general ideas in one's mind, and if one recites the Nichiren chant in front of the principal image--as determined by the Nichiren sect--the place will become 'Honmon no Kaidan.'
Honmon no Honzon (Nichiren Shoshu sect)': Hito-no-Honzon (human principal image) is Nichiren Daishonin (大聖人) and Ho-no-Honzon (principal image of dharma) is Namu Myohorenge-kyo of koto-no-ichinensanzen (事の一念三千), (the Three Thousand Realms Contained in One Mind).
(The Great Mandala includes both dharmas.)
Honmon no Kaidan': Koto-no-kaidan is a place where Honmon Kaidan Dai-Gohonzon (principal image) is enshrined, and Gi-no-kaidan is a place where Gohonzon stays.
Honmon no Daimoku': The Nichiren chant of belief (信の題目) is to believe Honmon Kaidan Dai-Gohonzon, and the Nichiren chant of practice (行の題目) is to recite Namu Myohorenge-kyo by oneself and recommend it to other people.
Among the Sandaihiho, the principal image is considered to be the supreme entity.
Sandaihiho was created as the root of Dai-Gohonzon of Honmon no Kaidan, which was said to have appeared before the founder of the sect on October 12, 1279, and if one opens this it will become Rokudaihiho (the Six Great Secret Dharmas) of the principal images of human and dharma (Koto-no-kaidan and Gi-no-kaidan) and the Nichiren chants of belief and practice; but if one opens it more, it becomes all 84,000 Homon in Buddhism.
Ichidaihiho (the One Great Secret Dharma) means Honmon no Honzon.
In other words it means Dai-Gohonzon, which includes all Sandaihiho.
If it is opened, it becomes Sandaihiho and Rokudaihiho.
When combined, they become Ichidaihiho.
(See Egihanmon-sho in Rokkan-sho (Six-volume Writings).)
Kokuchu-kai (before the defeat in World War II), Nichiren Shohu and Soka Gakkai (during the post-war period from 1955 to 1965), Fuji Taiseki-ji Kensho-kai and others endeavored to finalize a proposition for a national kaidan (although Nichiren Shohu and Soka Gakkai eventually withdrew the proposition for a national kaidan a few years before the construction of Shohon-do).
They are said to be rare examples in that they tried to interpret Sandaihiho around Kaidan.
Moreover, particularly after the great march of the Shakubuku (an evangelistic technique, in Japanese meaning "break and subdue") of Soka Gakkai, which was started in 1951, the three of the freedom of religion, nonintervention against civil affairs and the Juvenile Act have been given the slang expression Sandaihiho in order to show the shilly-shallying of public administrations such as the government, police and courts of law from both sides, specifically the victims of Shakubuku and the assailants (the devout believers).
Especially, there is information that some experienced members in radical associations advise young members that 'even if your aggressive Shakubuku is in fact accused of the crimes such as threatening, arson, abduction and confinement for the first time, you will be exempted from prosecution as long as you are underage (this includes "suspension of prosecution" as a result of admitting crimes).
This term is used in the same sense on both sides--victims and assailants--which is rarely seen among Buddhist sects of Nichiren lineage, because they usually use different terms and interpretations.
Jien (May 17, 1155 - October 28, 1225) was a priest of the Tendai sect in the Kamakura period and was famous for the history book, "Gukansho."
Shigo, posthumous name (based the deeds one has performed in their lifetime) was Jichin Osho and generally called Yoshimizu Sojo, and in Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets) he was called Saki-no-Daisojo Jien (Former High Priest JIEN).
Jien was the child of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi and Kaga-no-tsubone (a daughter of FUJIWARA no Nakamitsu) and a younger brother of Kanezane KUJO, the sixth child of Tadamichi.
He entered Shorenin Temple in his childhood, and in 1167 he was given vows to follow the precepts by Myoun, the temple's head priest of the Tendai sect.
In 1192, at age 38, he became the head priest of the Tendai sect.
Subsequently, he assumed the position of head priest of Tendai sect four times.
He held Buddhist mass and built temples as the head priest of the Tendai sect; politically, he acted as a guardian for Michiie KUJO (a grandson of Kanezane) and expected that FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (a son of Michiie) would go to Kamakura as the shogun, having the ideal of cooperation between the Imperial Court and the military government.
Additionally, he protected Honen who advocated Senshu Nenbutsu (single-mindedly chanting Namu-amida-butsu, which means devoting oneself to Amida Buddha) and his disciple Shinran, who were regarded as heretics at that time.
Moreover, Shinran entered the priesthood by Jien in 1181, at the age of 9.
He is also famous as a kajin (poet) who left the collection "Shugyoku-shu," and his name is seen in "Senzai Waka-shu (Collection of a Thousand Years)" and so on.
Moreover, he was the lyricist of Entenraku Imayo (a piece of Gagaku, traditional form of music in Japan), which is seen in textbooks.
As to its lyric, see the article on Utaimono (謡物).
"Gukansho" is a history book written by Jien, a priest of the Tendai sect, in the early Kamakura period.
It comprises seven volumes.
It was written around 1220 amid the rising tension between the Imperial Court and the shogunate, just before Jokyu no Ran (the Jokyu Rebellion), but subsequently it was revised.
Summary
It regarded history from the Emperor Jinmu to the Emperor Juntoku as the transition from the age of aristocracy to the age of warriors, and described it in Kana-bun (publication in kana alone) based on Mappo-shiso (the "end of the world" belief) and the idea of 'Dori (Order).'
Jien was a member of the Imperial Court, but he appreciated the government of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.
Additionally, there are descriptions that show the complicated situation around Jien as a member of the Sekkan-ke regent family (摂関家), such as that he implicitly criticized his father FUJIWARA no Tadamichi for being at odds with his own father, FUJIWARA no Tadazane (the grandfather of Jien), and blamed the Konoe clan, his half-brother's clan, as opposed to praising the Kujo clan, his brother's clan.
Composition
"Gukansho" consists of three parts, each of which has a different character: volumes 1 and 2 chronicle the emperors since Jinmu, volumes 3 to 6 center on the transition of Dori together with the descriptions of history, and volume 7 is a general overview on Dori.
According to Masamichi SUZUKI, a professor at Hirosaki University, the writing began with volume 3 and the Emperors' chronicle was added at the end.
In volume 7 he described that everything was based on Dori and that the way to reform society should be implemented by Dori.

Henjo (born 816, died February 12, 890) was an early Heian period poet and one of the Six Poets and also one of the Thirty-six Immortal Poets.
His original name was YOSHIMINE no Munesada.
He was the eighth son of Dainagon YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo, son of the Emperor Kanmu.
There are theories suggesting that his mother was the Emperor Koko's wet nurse.
He had a son called Sosei Hoshi.
Henjo was Kurodo (keeper of imperial archives) for the Emperor Ninmyo, who favored him, and reached the position of Jugoinojo Kurodo no to (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade, head of Kurodo) in 849, but upon the death of the Emperor Ninmyo, he became a priest and was a disciple of Ennin and Enchin.
He established Gankei-ji Temple in Kazan and became Betto (head priest) of Urin-in Temple in Murasakino in 869.
He became Sojo (high Buddhist priest) in 885 and was called Kazan-sojo.
According to the 'Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku' (literally, "the authentic records of three Japanese reigns"), Henjo's seventieth birthday celebration hosted by the Emperor Koko was held in court at the Jinjuden on December 18 (old Lunar calendar), suggesting a teacher-student relationship with the Emperor Koko regarding waka.
The kana introduction in 'Kokin Waka-shu' (the first anthology of poems commissioned by the Emperor) says 'his poems have good taste and style but lack real emotion.
It is like feeling attracted to a picture of a woman.'
About 35 poems have been selected to be included in Imperial-commissioned poem anthologies, beginning with the 'Kokin Waka-shu.'
There is a collection of his poetical works, called 'Henjo-shu,' but it does not have any uniqueness because it is only a collection of poems by Henjo taken from Imperial-commissioned poem anthologies.
The dew drop on the tip of a leaf and the dew that has dropped on the roots, must be an example of life's transience where some people die later and some die earlier.
Heavenly wind, stop the clouds from climbing, so I can keep the beautiful maidens in sight for a little longer.
Henjo was well-suited to be the character of many stories because in spite of being noble-born as a grandchild of the Emperor Kanmu, he climbed to the position of Sojo after becoming a priest of the Tendai sect and was also one of the first priest-poets.
Stories of his amorous exploits before becoming a priest and stories about him not telling his wife when he became a priest are found in 'Yamato Monogatari,' 'Konjaku Monogatari-shu,' 'Hobutsu-shu,' 'Jukkin-sho' and stories about his miracle-working after he became a priest are found in 'Konjaku Monogatari-shu' and 'Zokuhoncho-ojoden.'
He appears under the name of YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo in the Kabuki Dance 'Tsumoru Koi Yuki no Sekinoto' (Love and Deep Snow at the Mountain Barrier), which was produced in the Edo period.
The Shingi Shingon sect is a school of the Shingon sect (whose founding father was Kobo-daishi Kukai), and this school is connected to Raiyu, a high-ranking Buddhist priest of the Kakuban school, which followed the teachings of Kogyo Daishi Kakuban, who brought about the revival of the Shingon sect.
This sect was given the name 'Shingi' because its followers proposed new teachings at Mt Koya.
The original Shingon sect was then given the name 'Kogi Shingon,' but this is not really appropriate as the name was given not because the sect had old teachings but because it was old relative to the Shingi Shingon sect.
The broad definition of 'Shingi Shingon sect' includes Shingi Shingon sect which considers its Grand Head Temple as Grand Head Temple Negoro-ji Temple, Shingon sect Chisan school with its Head Temple at Chishakuin Temple, Shingon sect Buzan school with its Head Temple at Hasedera Temple, Shingon sect Muro-ji school with its Head Temple at Muro-ji Temple, but the narrow definition indicates the group, 'Shingi Shingon sect' which considers its Head Temple as Negoro-ji Temple.
The major difference is that the original Shingon sect (the so-called Kogi Shingon sect) teaches Varirocana teachings (teaching that Dainichinyorai, the highest buddha in the Shingon sect, himself preaches), whereas the Shingi Shingon sect teaches Adhisthana-kaya teachings (teaching that Dainichinyorai becomes Adhisthana-kaya in order to preach).
A heated discussion on religious issues that are irrelevant to normal followers has continued.
History
In the Heian Period, corruption by priests led to a crisis within the Shingon sect and emergency measures to rebuild the sect were taken by Kakuban, who was a high priest of Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple.
However, there was a critical conflict between the conservatives (main temple/Konsobu-ji Temple side) who wanted to keep existing measures and Kakuban school (Daidenpo-in side).
As a result, the Kakuban school left Mt. Koya and transferred their headquarters to Bufuku-ji Temple in Iwate-sho, a manor owned by Daidenpo-in.
Kakuba's activity at Negoro started here.
After the nirvana of Kakuban in 1143, Kakuban school led by one of their priests, Raiyu, re-transferred Daidenpo-in to Mt. Koya, but the argument was not settled and 145 years later in 1288, the acting leader of the Kakuban school, Raiyu, took his followers and returned to Mt. Negoro to further develop Kakuban's teaching and established the Shingi Shingon sect that taught 'Shingi' different to that of conventional teachings.
Later, Negoro-ji Temple's size grew and was significantly militarized with priest soldiers, which Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI determined as disrupting the peace, and in the spring of 1585, a large army attacked Mt. Negoro, totally destroying Negoro-ji Temple and executing many of the priests.
Not only the temple treasures but also most of the Shingi literature, which led to the temple having the reputation, 'Negoro, place of learning,' was burnt to ashes and the Shingi Shingon sect was virtually demolished.
However, in the confusion, some priests reached Hasedera Temple and Chishakuin Temple and survived.
Hideyoshi's policy regarding religion was to divide the Grand Head Temple Negoro-ji Temple into two, Chisan school and Buzan school, and decrease the power of the religious city, Negoro.
Although reconstruction was permitted in the Edo Period, few of the priests that left Negoro did return.
In the Edo period, as part of their program to settle the wrongs of the Toyotomi government, the Tokugawa clan pardoned the Shingi Shingon sect and together with the reconstruction of Negoro-ji Temple, Kakuban was afforded the honorary title of 'Kokyo-Daishi' from the Emperor Higashiyama.
During the late Edo Period, Hoju-Hojo-Koga-Eisho-Shinkai-Shinyu-Joyu KODAMA became the head, and after the Meiji Restoration, Negoro-ji Temple restored the temple head priest title.
The first head priest in the prosperous Chuko period was Buzan school Noke, Shuzen MORINO, and the head priests until that time were mostly heads from Daigo-ji Temple or Ninna-ji Temple, it was a tradition in Negoro-ji Temple to install a Gakuto other than the head priest from external temples.
In 1886, Negoro-ji Temple was selected as the main Dojo of the Shingi school.
Since 1900, the Noke of the Shingi Shingon sect Buzan school and Shingi Shingon sect Chisan school have acted in turn as the Head Priest of Daidenpo-in Temple with three-year rotations, but this tradition of alternating Buzan and Chisan has also been seen since the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) from Genyo-Nisshu-Raigen-Genyu-Senyo.
After World War II, with the revision of the Religious Corporation Act in 1953, the Shingi Shingon sect was established with Negoro-ji Temple as the Grand Head Temple and still exists up to the present day.

Honzon has the following meanings.
Sculptures, paintings, mandalas, named inscriptions of Buddha or Bosatsu, are considered to be the most important objects of religious belief installed in Buddhist temples or altars, or carried around on the body as an amulet.
In religions other than Buddhism, an object of religious attention that is held to be important.
In daily life outside of Buddhism, the central person or person who should not be sidelined or a precious object.
Here we describe the use of Honzon as a Buddhist term.
(Other meanings are derivatives of Honzon as a Buddhist term)
The name and concept of Honzon comes from the teachings of Daibirushanabutsu-Jinpenkaji-kyo Sutra.
There are two conditions to Honzon.
They are clean and unclean.
If the Honzon is clean, it will depart from all and if it is unclean, with thoughts, it will be kei/gyo.
The two conditions to Honzon make two things possible.
Because with thoughts, it can reach the Siddhi (the ultimate destination) of thoughts, and because it is without thoughts, it can create the Siddhi of no thoughts.
Setsu-honzon-sanmai-bon, no. 28
In Japan, during the Kamakura Buddhism period, Nichiren taught that the following three conditions should be observed.
Konpon-sonsu
He should be revered and worshiped as 'the foundation of everything in the world.'
Honrai-soncho
He should be esteemed for being 'what we ourselves should ideally be in the flesh.'
Honnu-songyo
He should reveal his 'appearance and shape of blessed existence' that has always been in existence since the infinite past but was hidden until the present.
This is considered to have been the result of feelings of rivalry towards the Shingon sect founded by Kukai, who Nichiren is thought to have considered as his foremost rival.
The character styles of the Great Mandala for Honzon designated by various schools of the Nichiren sect all show similarity to Bonji (Siddham characters), which is a major characteristic of the Shingon sect.
Honzon of Various sects
The Honzon of major sects in Japanese Buddhism are shown below.
Nanto Six sects - the Honzon differs depending on the temple.
Todai-ji Temple (Kegon sect) Kon-do Honzon is a Vairocana (famous as the Big Buddha), Yakushi-ji Temple (Hosso-shu sect) Kon-do Honzon is Yakushi-nyorai, Kofuku-ji Temple (Hosso-shu) Chukon-do Honzon is Shakanyorai.
Tendai sect - this sect was introduced to Japan by Saicho and inherits teachings from four sects, En (Tendai), Mitsu (Mikkyo), Zen (Zen-shu and Kai (Kairitsu) and the Honzon of each temple varies.
The Honzon of Enryaku-ji Temple is Yakushinyorai for Konpon Chu-do, the east tower of Enryaku-ji Temple, Shakanyorai for Tenhorin-do (Shaka-do) for the west tower and Kannon Bosatsu for the Yokokawa Chu-do in Enryaku-ji Temple Yokokawa.
Some temples like Shinsho Gokuraku-ji Temple have Amidanyorai as a Honzon.
Shingon sect – Dainichinyorai is the most revered, but the Honzon of each temple varies, such as Shakanyorai, Amidanyorai, Yakushinyorai, Kannon Bosatsu and Fudo Myoo.
This is thought to be based on the thinking that all Buddhas are a sign of universal truth and a manifestation of Dainichinyorai, who has attained Buddhism's highest form of existence, in a different appearance.
The Honzon of To-ji Temple, Jingo-ji Temple and Daigo-ji Temple are Yakushinyorai, and Kongobu-ji Temple has Ashuku-nyorai (considered the same as Yakushinyorai) as the Honzon.
Jodo sect - Amidanyorai (seated image)
Jodo Shinshu sect - Honson is one Buddha, Amidanyorai (standing image)
The form is a wooden statue or painted image.
Or a named Honzon of 'Namu Amidabutsu.'
Rinzai sect – Shakanyorai is often the Butsuden Honzon (depending upon past connections, may also be Kannon Bosatsu, Amidanyorai, Jizo Bosatsu, etc.), however, the Zen sect temples tend to revere Soshi images as much as, or sometimes even more than Buddha images.
Soto sect – Shakanyorai is often the Butsuden Honzon (however, it is considered conceptually as existing in the soul)
Depending upon past connections, may also be Kanzeon Bosatsu, Amidanyorai, Jizo Bosatsu, etc.). However, the Zen sect temples tend to revere Soshi (founder) images as much as, or sometimes even more than Buddha images.
Nichiren sect, Hokke sect - 'Sanbo-son' consisting of a pagoda with Shakamunibutsu of Kuonjitsujo, Great Madara drawn just before Nichiren's nirvana in 1282 and the Nichiren chant written in the center, and Shakanyorai and Taho-nyorai on the sides, with a statue of Nichiren below it.
Nichiren Shoshu – Honzon of October 12, 1279 (Nichiren-Shoshu) (usually called, Ita-Mandala)
The Ichimai Kishomon is a will left by Honen on February 27, 1212 just prior to his death.
It is ordinarily entitled Honen Shonin Goikun Ichimai Kishomon.
The original can be seen at Konkaikomyo-ji Temple.
It is displayed to the public during the anniversary of Honen's death on April 23 and 24.

Shaka Sanzon is a style in Buddhism for installing Buddha images.
In Japan, this style normally installs Shakanyorai with a robe worn with the right shoulder exposed with Semu-in, Yogan-in or Seppo-in as the Chuson (center) with Monju Bosatsu riding on a lion to the left and Fugen Bosatsu riding an elephant to the left (as attendant figures).
(The 'left' and 'right' here refers to the 'left' and 'right' seen from the Chuson.)
Rarely, Shakanyorai's attendants are Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu instead of Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu.
Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu are thought to be brother Bosatsu, and they cured people of diseases of the mind and body by giving them good medicine.
The attendant figures of the Shakanyorai Sanzon figures (National Treasure) in Horyu-ji Temple Kon-do are said to be Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu according to temple legend.
The attendant figures of the Honzon Shakanyorai of Kofukuji-ji Temple Chukon-do in Nara (Kamakura Period, Important Cultural Property), are also called Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu.
The Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu of Kofuku-ji Temple were originally attendant figures for the Honzon Shakanyorai in the Saikon-do (removed) Kofuku-ji Temple, and the current figures were reconstructed in the Kamakura Period, but Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu figures have been installed in the Saikon-do since it was established during the Nara Period.
These Yakuo Bosatsu and Yakujo Bosatsu figures are ordinary Bosatsu figures without any outstanding characteristics regarding appearance, clothing, accessories, etc.
There are also examples of attendant figures being Kannon Bosatsu and Kokuzo Bosatsu or Bonten and Taishakuten.
The various schools of Zen sects such as Rinzai sect, Soto sect and Obaku sect place importance on 'Shaka as a human' and in some cases have Daikasho-sonja and Anan-sonja as attendant figures to Shakanyorai, together with Judai deshi or Juroku Zenshin.
Nichiren sect and Hokke sect place importance on 'Shaka as Honbutsu' and install a Taho Pagoda (pagoda) in the center with Shakamuni-butsu and Taho-nyorai on either side.
The attendants are the four major Bosatsu, Benhuadiyong, Jogyo Bosatsu, Muhengyo Bosatsu, Jogyo Bosatsu and Anryugyo Bosatsu.
In this case, it differs from other Sanzon figures in the configuration of one Seson-two Bosatsu, but is a two Seson-four Bosatsu.
Bonsho are hanging bells as a Buddhist equipment used in East Asian temples.
It is rung with a wooden bell hammer and has a heavy resonant sound.
It is more normally known as the bells rung on New Year's Eve.
Other names include Ogane, Kosho, Horo, Geisho, Kyogei, Kagei, etc.
"Bon" is a phonetic translation of "Brahma" (holy and clean) of Sanskrit.
Depending upon the country of production, it is called a Chinese bell, Korean bell (Goryeo bell, Silla bell), and Washo (Japanese bell).
Although Buddhism is a religion that originated in India and has expanded throughout Asia, the origins of Bonsho are hardly found in India but in ancient Chinese bronze ware.
The bronze ware "Sho," produced during the Yin and Zhou periods, are thought to be the origins of Bonsho, but generally the size of "Sho" is small and the cross-section is not a circle as found in Bonsho of later times but it is almond-shaped.
As an old example of Chinese Bonsho, there is a bell in Nara National Museum that has the inscription of Chen (South Dynasty) in 575.
This bell with the inscription of 575 is similar to Japanese bells in later times and is considered to be their predecessor because it has a circular cross-section, horizontal and vertical bands dividing the bell body, hook section for hanging the bell that is shaped like a dragon and a Tsukiza (pedestal of the bell) decorated with a lotus pattern.
However, the small round projections called "Chi" do not have any decorations and this is different from Japanese Bonsho.
Regarding the introduction of Bonsho to Japan, there is a record in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) stating that OTOMO no Sadehiko brought one back from Goguryeo in 562, but an actual artifact from this time has not been found.
The Bonsho in Myoshin-ji Temple in Kyoto (National Treasure) has an inscription of the year of 698 on the inner side and this is the oldest Japanese Bonsho with a confirmed production date.
Korean Bonsho before the Goryeo period are found not only in the Korean Peninsula but also many in Japan and the oldest one with an established date, the year of 833, is the bell in Jogu-jinja Shrine in Fukui Prefecture.
Most Japanese Bonsho are modeled on the Chinese bell style and ones on the Korean style are considered to be rare.
Originally, Bonsho has the important role of Buddhism to be rung as a first bell signaling Buddhist rites including Buddhist memorial services.
It is also used to keep time in the morning and evening (Gyosho (the morning ringing) and Konsho (the evening ringing)).
However, the Bonsho was not rung simply to indicate time, but listening to the resonance allows the listener to escape all suffering and attain enlightenment.
Such merits of the Bonsho are commonly found in the inscriptions on the bell.
Many are made from bronze, but some small-sized bells are rarely made from iron.
Small-sized bells (in one theory, ones under approximately 51.5 cm in diameter), called Hansho (Kansho, Densho), have a high-pitched sound used for not only Buddhist rites but also as an alarm bell for fires, etc.
To improve the resonance, it is said that sometimes rings (gold) were included when the bell was cast, and there are examples in the Edo period where oval gold coins were cast together.
There are also some documents suggesting the relationship between Gagaku (Japanese traditional music and dance) and bells.
Many Bonsho in Japan were donated and melted down during World War II in response to the Metal Collection Act.
Bells that were designated cultural property and other old or important bells still exist, but many bells produced in modern times were melted down and it is said that over 90% of Japanese bells were lost during World War II.
The main body of Japanese bells is divided horizontally by three horizontal bands called Jotai (the upper band), Chutai (the middle band) and Katai (the lower band), and also divided in the vertical direction by bands referred to as Jutai (vertical bands).
There are normally 4 Jutai and they divide the bell body into 4 parts (some modern bells have 5).
The upper region between Jotai and Chutai is called "Chi-no-ma", and the bottom region is called "Ike-no-ma."
"Chi-no-ma" has small decorative projections called "Chi."
"Ike-no-ma" may be without any decorations, but in some cases, this is where an inscription is cast (or engraved) or images such as tennin or Buddha are placed.
The region between Chutai and Katai is called "Kusa-no-ma."
2 Tsukiza are usually set symmetrically in the bell body where the hammer hits (in some rare cases, there are 4 Tsukiza).
The principal decoration of the Tsukiza is a lotus pattern.
The basic shape of Japanese bells did not change substantially from the Nara period to the Edo period, but there are small characteristic differences for each period.
One major point for determining the age of Bonsho is the positional relationship between Tsukiza and Ryuzu (dragon-shaped hanger).
In bells from the Nara period to the early Heian period, the line connecting the two Tsukiza and the long axis of Ryuzu are usually perpendicular.
In other words, the direction that the bell swings and the long axis of Ryuzu bisect each other at right angles.
On the other hand, bells made after the late Heian period have a different Ryuzu position and the line connecting the two Tsukiza and the long axis of Ryuzu are usually in the same direction.
In other words, the direction that the bell swings and the long axis of Ryuzu is the same (there are some exceptions).
Additionally, the position of Tsukiza of bells in the Nara period and early Heian period were high and placed close to the center of the bell body, whereas bells after the late Heian period tend to have a lower Tsukiza position.
The Bonsho researcher, Ryohei TSUBOI regards the following 16 bells as Bells of the Nara period.

Seishi Bosatsu, Bon name: mahaasthaamapraapta, is a Bosatsu in Buddhism.
It is sometimes written as Daiseishi Bosatsu or Tokudaiseishi Bosatsu.
The Sanmayagyo symbol is mibu renge (lotus bud).
Shushi (Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism)) (Shuji) is Saku (saH).
The Kyoji (statues that accompany a central Buddha figure) to the right of Amida Sanzon govern the Chimon of Buddha and inspires Bodaishin (a desire to attain enlightenment and save others) in people.
This Bosatsu saves people from falling into hell and the world of hungry spirits by holding the light of wisdom to lighten all things.
Currently, it is known in Japan as the guardian Honzon of the year of the horse.
The reason why it is thought to be called Daiseishi is that it can successfully 'reach' the point where many things can be 'Daisei' or saved.
In Japan, it is very rare for Seishi Bosatsu to be the sole target of religious attention, and is usually found as an attendant figure of Amida Sanzon.
Whereas Kannon Bosatsu have an artificial Buddha on the front of the diadem, Seishi Bosatsu customarily have a water jug.
In the Raigo (literally, "welcoming") style of Amida Sanzon, in which the Buddha is believed to descend to Earth to welcome a believer facing death, the Kannon Bosatsu holds a lotus-shaped pedestal, whereas Seishi Bosatsu is expressed as having his palms held together in prayer.
From the Medieval Period, there has been a theory that Honen was an incarnation of Seishi Bosatsu.
Honen was called Seishi-maru when he was a child, and was full of knowledge and will during his lifetime, being called 'Honen-bo, no. 1 for knowledge and will.'
After Honen's death, his disciple Shinran wrote 'Daiseishi Bosatsu Wasan' and said 'Daiseishi Bosatsu is Genku Shonin (Honen)'s Honji (substance)' in the end.
Eshin-ni Shosoku' has a story where Shinran's wife, Eshin-ni has a mystical dream where she sees 'a bright Buddha full of light' and hears a voice saying 'that is Seishi Bosatsu, in other words, Honen.'
In Chion-in Temple Kyoto, Seishi-do was established to install Seishi Bosatsu as the Honzon.
This is considered Honen's Honji.
This figure is joining his palms in the same style as Seishi Bosatsu as attendant in Raigo style Amida Sanzon
In the Medieval Period, many copies of the Zenko-ji-nyorai (Zenko-ji-shiki Amida Sanzon) in Nagano were made and the two Bosatsu, Kannon and Seishi, are shown with hands on top of each other and placed in front of their chest.
Yakushi sanzon, or Yakushi triad, is one of the styles to place Buddhist images in Buddhism.
It is a triad style and consists of Yakushi-Nyorai (Bhaisajyaguru) at the center (Chuson) and two Kyoji (attendant figures), Nikko Bosatsu (Sunlight Bodhisattva) on the left and Gakko Bosatsu (Moonlight Bodhisattva) on the right.
(The 'left' or 'right' in this case is the direction as seen from Yakushi-Nyorai).
The name of Gakko Bosatsu means to be free from the burning earthly desires of life and death of living things with the coolness of the moon.
The statue of the principal image of Buddha at Kondo (Golden Hall) in Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara City is an old example of Yakushi sanzon statues and is one of the masterpieces in Japan.
Generally, Chuson was made as a sedentary statue and Kyoji were made as standing statues like the statues of Yakushi-ji Temple, but in some cases both Chuson and Kyoji were made as sedentary statues such as in the Daikodo Lecture Hall of Horyu-ji Temple.
Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu
Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu are described as the main Buddha in the Buddhist paradise of Yakushi-Nyorai, the realm known as Joruri or Pure Lapis Lazuli in the eastern quarter, Vaiduryanirbhasa in Sanskrit in "Yakushi Hongan-kyo Sutra," and it can be said that there is neither faith nor statues of Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu individually, other than the statues of the Kyoji of Yakushi-Nyorai.
From the viewpoint of iconography, each Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu often has the sun disc and the moon disc, but there are old cases where they have no belongings, like the statue at the Kondo hall in Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara.
In addition, in some cases Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu are Kyoji in place of other statues except at Yakushi-Nyorai.
For example, the Kyoji of Senju Kannon (Sahasrabhuja-arya-avalokites 'vara, "Thousand-armed Kannon" or Kannon with a thousand arms) Statue, the principal image of Buddha at Dojo-ji Temple in Wakayama Prefecture, are Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu.
The Nikko Bosatsu and Gakko Bosatsu statues which are placed on both sides of Fukukensaku Kannon, (or Fukukenjaku Kannon, Never Empty Lasso Kannon (deity of Mercy)), the principal image at Hokke-do (Sangatsudo) of Todai-ji Temple in Nara are famous as masterpieces of Tenpyo sculpture (style of sculpture created in Tenpyo period) but the original names of the statues are not known and they seem to have not been shaped as Nikko and Gakko Bosatsu from the beginning.
Yuzu Nenbutsu sect is one of the sects of pure land teachings, Jodo-kyo.
When Sho Taishi Ryonin, priests of the Tendai sect, were performing the ascetic practices at Ohara Raigo-in Temple (Sakyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City) on June 16, 1117 during the end of Heian period, he was given Gemon of 速疾往生 (the way for one to reach Buddhism quickly from Amida Nyorai(Amitabha Tathagata)), '一人一切人 一切人一人 一行一切行 一切行一行 十界一念 融通念仏 億百万編 功徳円満' from Amida Nyorai and founded the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect.
It is also called Dainenbutsu sect.
Grand Head Temple
Dainenbutsu-ji Temple (Hirano Ward, Osaka City)
It was built by Ryonin, the founder of the sect, according to the imperial prayers of the Emperor Toba in 1127.
It is said that it was the former Shuraku-ji Temple, which was built in the personal residence of SAKANOUE no Hirono, who was the second son of SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro and was commonly called 'Hirano-dono,' who developed this area in the Heian period.
It was the first Buddhist invocation dojo, or place of Buddhist practice or meditation.
Dharma
Its main sutras (正依) are "Kegon-kyo Sutra"(Avatamska Sutra) and "Hoke-kyo Sutra" (Lotus Sutra) and minor sutras (傍依) are "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra"(Sutra of Infinite Life) and "Kanmuryoju-kyo Sutra" ('The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life,' meaning Amida) and "Amida-kyo Sutra" (Amida Sutra), and it preaches that reciting Buddhist invocation makes people reincarnated in Jodo, pure land, from the viewpoint that 'Buddhist invocation by one person equals Buddhist invocation to all people.'
History
Yuzu Nenbutsu, which Ryonin began, was mainly temple solicitation and pilgrimage at first and developed from a collective motion having no organization as a Buddhism sect.
Yuzu Nenbutsu became popular, such as in Dainenbutsu-ji Temple at Hirano (Osaka City) in Osaka and Seiryo-ji Temple and Mibu-dera Temple in Kyoto, and Dainenbutsu-kyogen Dainenbutsu Kyogen (Kyogen (farce played during a No play cycle) to teach Buddhism to the public) by Engaku Shonin, the restorer of Yuzu Nenbutsu, and has been transmitted at Mibu-dera Temple, Seiryo-ji Temple, Injo-ji Temple (Kyoto City) and Shinsen-en.
The 7th Homyo in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) was regarded as the restorer and established the system of Roku Betsuji (六別時制度) which selected the chief priest of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple.
It began to have color as a sect around the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States), but the tradition of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple was stopped several times and the temples of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect became other sect's temples and lost traction.
From 1688 to 1703, the Yukan of the 46th head priest of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple, who was regarded as a founder of the reemergence of Yuzu Nenbutsu, tried to revive Yuzu Nenbutsu by putting dharma in the statutory form by 'Yuzu enmonsho' (Outlines of the Yuzu-Nembutsu Theology), determining rules as a sect and providing dormitory, which led to the establishment of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect.
Since 'Yuzu enmonsho' was written in kanbun, classical Chinese, 'Yuzu nenbutsu shingesho' (document for understanding and mastering Yuzu nenbutsu), which was written in Japanese, were widespread in order to cover the negative effects of the former.
Character
The greatest characteristic of Yuzu Nenbutsu is that it put higher value on Invocation of the Buddha's Name than Kanso Nenbustu (Buddha ideation through chanting and visualization), so that the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect makes reciting Buddhism invocation (Yuzu Nenbutsu), which was preached by Ryonin and expects Jikkai (ten spiritual realms) Ichinen (a single repetition of a prayer) and rebirth in Jodo of Jita Yuzu (自他融通, literally, Yuzu Nenbutsu for oneself and others), ten times toward the west every morning as a daily duty.
It was the pioneering work of Senshu Nenbutsu (the Single-Minded Recitation of the Nenbutsu) and transmitted the purer Jodo-kyo Buddhism of the Tendai sect, so that it can be said to have the advanced form and content of the later Jodo and Jodo Shinshu sects.
Fugen Bosatsu, samanta bhadra in Sanskrit, is a venerable Bosatsu entity and is Bodhisattva, which is worshipped in Mahayana Buddhism.
Sanma yagyo (characteristic things of the Buddha) is a sword and Gokosho (A short club with five prongs at each end, usually made of gilt bronze).
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) is aM and huuM.
The Sanskrit name samanta bhadra means 'far and widewise man' and that he is a wise man who appears in the far and wide world and relieves people with Buddha's mercy and intelligence.
In addition, since it is seen in Hoke-kyo Sutra which preaches Nyonin Jobutsu (Attainment of Buddhahood by women), it has been especially worshipped by women.
In Mikkyo it is regarded as a symbol of aspiration for Buddhahood (a mind to seek enlightenment through mastering the truth) and seen as the same entity as Kongosatta which has the same character.
For this reason, Fugen Bosatsu is often called Kongoshu Bosatsu, another name for Kongosatta, as well.
Mt. Gabi (Emeishan) in Sichuan Province, China are regarded as Reijo, sacred ground, of the Fugen Bosatsu and statues are placed as Kyoji, attendant figures, of Shakanyorai with Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri).
(See Shaka sanzon, Shaka triad.)
As an individual Buddha, the most common figure is expressed as a figure which joins its hands in prayer in the lotus position on a white elephant that has six ivory tusks and has Rengeza (padmasana, Lotus base) on the back.
In Mikkyo it is expressed as a figure which has a lotus stem on which a treasure sword is placed in the left hand and a figure which has gokorei (a five-pronged bell) in the left hand and Gokosho in the right hand in the same way as Kongosatta, and figures which have nyoi (an implement carried by Buddhist priests at a ceremony or during formal preaching), lotus flower and scriptures as well.
In Japan from the middle of the Heian period, it was worshipped mainly by noble women in accordance with the prevalence of Hoke-kyo Sutra, which preaches women's relief.
In Japan there are many pictures and statues, such as the wooden statue (national treasure) of Fine Arts in the latter part of Heian period at The Okura Shukokan Museum.
Fugen Enmei Bosatsu,' has venerable status and was more strongly influenced by Mikkyo, and is regarded as a strong venerable entity with 22 hands and many examples of this work have been made in Japan.
Concerning pictures, the picture of Fugen Bosatsu on an elephant in Tokyo National Museum (national treasure, the latter part of the Heian period) is a representative work.
The book of Bujo-ji Temple in Tottori Prefecture (national treasure) and the book of Nara National Museum (important cultural property) and others are known as representative works.
It is said that the kenzoku of Fugen Bosatsu is ju-rasetsunyo, or ten demonesses, and that sometimes Kishimo-jin, a mother of the Ju-rasetsunyos, is placed as kenzoku.
At an early date, Ju-rasetsunyo put employed Tang dynasty Chinese costumes, but there are also many works of Ju-rasetsunyo using Japanese costumes influenced by Japanese culture.
This is because Fugen Bosatsu and Ju-rasetsunyo swear 'to guard people who defend Hoke-kyo Sutra' together in Hoke-kyo Sutra, and it became the reason for women's belief that these goddess's stay close to Fugen Bosatsu.
In addition, in the novel "Feng-Shen-Yen-I" (Popular Account of the Promotion to Divinity), the Sennin (wizards) named Fugen Shinjin and Monju Koho Tenson appeared and later came to believe in Buddhism, and subsequently became Fugen Bosatsu and Monji Bosatsu, respectively.
On Sanmaya Sabaton.
Kyoto Gozan Temples refers the status of a Buddhist temple, and to the system of state-sponsored temples of the Zen sect (Rinzai sect) in Kyoto among the Five Mountain System.
Since around the end of the Kamakura Period, the Hojo clan introduced the Five Mountain System and selected Kamakura Five Mountain after the example of the Southern Sungs.
In the latter part of the Kamakura Period, the Emperor Godaigo started an anti-Shogunate movement and when the Kenmu Restoration by the Emperor Godaigo began after the fall of the Shogunate, the Five Mountain System was reformed to meet with Kyoto.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), after Takauji ASHIKAGA left the Kenmu Government, Five Mountain was newly selected from temples in Kyoto mainly by Soseki MUSO, whom the Ashikaga Shogunate family trusted, because Takauji and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA trusted the Zen sect.
Although there were several changes of selection, in 1386 the third Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA determined it as follows after construction of Shokoku-ji Temple, and took over the power of appointing chief priests by the system of Sorokushi (僧録司) and therefore controlled temples, which added a religious aspect to the prestige of the Shogunate.
The priests of Five Mountain, such as Myoha SHUNOKU and Shushin GIDO, were familiar with Chinese culture and played roles as diplomatic counselors when Yoshimitsu carried out trade between the Ming Dynasty and Japan (licensed trade).
Nanzen-ji Temple - Bekkaku (exceptional)
Tenryu-ji Temple - the first grade*
Shokoku-ji Temple - the second grade*
Kennin-ji Temple - the third grade
Tofuku-ji Temple - the fourth grade
Manju-ji Temple - the fifth grade
*Moreover, in accordance with Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA's wish, Shokoku-ji Temple was changed to the first grade and Tenryu-ji Temple was changed to the second grade on April 27, 1401, but after Yoshimitsu's death they were reverted back to the former grades on April 11, 1410.
Sessai TAIGEN or Sufu TAIGEN (1496 - November 23,1555) was a vassal of the Imagawa clan.
The posthumous name was Sufu.
He was a son of Masamori IHARA (Saemon-no-jo (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards)) and his mother was a daughter of Masanobu OKITSU.
The Ihara clan on the paternal side ruled around Ihara of Suruga Province (present Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture).
The Okitsu clan on the maternal side grasped marine transport, based on Yokoyama-jo Castle, and also headed the pirates (navy).
Both clans were senior vassals of the Imagawa clan.
Biography
At first, he identified himself as Shogiku KYUEI and practiced ascetic training at Zentoku-ji Temple in Suruga, and later at Kennin-ji Temple of the Kyoto Gozan (Five Great zen Temples of Kyoto).
He was said to be a promising brilliant person at around this time.
He was asked to serve the Imagawa clan by his master, Ujichika IMAGAWA, who heard this reputation, and was appointed to educate his fifth son, Hogiku-maru (later Yoshimoto IMAGAWA).
According to one estimate, he refused this request twice.
In 1530 Hogiku-maru had a Tokudo ceremony (entering Buddhist priesthood) by Ryusu JOAN, his master at the Kennin-ji Temple and changed his name to Shoho.
The two moved to Kennin-ji Temple for more ascetic training from Zentoku-ji Temple, and later moved to Myoshin-ji Temple.
Around this time Shoho was given Dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) 'Baigaku' and identified himself as Shogiku BAIGAKU and later changed his name to Sufu TAIGEN (Sessai).
In 1535 he went back to Suruga in order to participate in the sixth anniversary of the death of Shoshun KINKEI who was a chief priest of Zentoku-ji Temple, and entered Zentoku-ji Temple again.
In the following year, 1536, Ujiteru IMAGAWA, who succeeded Ujichika, died.
A succession race between Shoho BAIGAKU and his half brother Etan GENKO, among the Imagawa clan, occurred (Hanakura War).
Sessai supported Shoho BAIGAKU with Jukei-ni, and achieved his succession to the clan and exclaustration.
By that achievement, Yoshimoto IMAGAWA put strong faith in Sessai and gave him the supreme post of politics and military affairs.
While Sessai had religious influence as a chief priest of Sunpu Rinzai-ji Temple (Shizuoka City), he was also called 'administrative ruler' or 'general' of the Imagawa clan and supported Yoshimoto with impressive ability in politics, military affairs and foreign policy.
In 1537 he struck an alliance of marriage with the Takeda clan.
He held talks with the Gohojo clan in Sunto.
In 1547 he captured Tahara-jo Castle in Mikawa Province.
At the Battle of Azuki-zaka slope with the Oda clan in 1548, he had an advantage as a commander in chief.
In 1549 he attacked Ansho-jo Castle and captured Nobuhiro ODA (half brother of Nobunaga ODA) and returned Takechiyo MATSUDAIRA, a hostage of the Oda clan, back to the Imagawa clan side.
In 1553 he established 21 articles of Imagawa Kana Mokuroku Tsuika (expanding on the Imagawa family rules), which is bunkokuho (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain) of the Imagawa territory.
In 1554 he made efforts for Suruga Province to form a tripartite alliance with the Takeda clan of Kai Province and the Gohojo clan of Sagami Province.
In addition to these, Sessai contributed greatly to the height of prosperity of the Imagawa clan by controlling temples and religions, mainly those of the Rinzai sect, and implementing commercial policy to protect local merchants in the Imagawa territory.
Moreover, he was also a well-educated person and wrote "Rekidaijoryaku" (a book about chinese history).
In 1555 he died at Chokei-ji Temple in Suruga Province.
He was at the age of 60 years.
Others
It is said that he also acted as guardian of Ujizane IMAGAWA, the legitimate son of Yoshimoto IMAGAWA, and Motoyasu MATSUDAIRA (Ieyasu TOKUGAWA), a hostage of the Imagawa clan at that time, but it was during the same period as Sessai left Suruga (during negotiations with the Takeda and Gohojo clans and expedition to Mikawa Province) so it is unknown whether he in fact influenced both persons or not.
Since he displayed great ability as Yoshimoto IMAGAWA's right-hand man and contributed much to the expansion of the Imagawa clan, much literature recognizes him by such as, 'If Sessai had lived until the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, Yoshimoto would not have been subverted by Nobunaga ODA,' and 'the Imagawa clan started to decline soon after Sessai's death.'
Sho Kannon, aarya avalokitezvara in Sanskrit is a venerable entity of Bosatsu, Bodhisattva, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
It is also called 'Sei Kannon' and is one of the Roku Kannon (six Kannon).
There are various figures of the statue of Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu (Kanzeon Bosatsu, Kanjizai Bosatsu), among which the statues with one face and two arms are called Sho Kannon, not the statues with superhuman appearance and many faces and arms.
聖観音 (Sho Kannon, literally Sacred Kannon) is also written as 正観音 (Sho Kannon, literally Real Kannon).
It is said that it benefits Jigoku-do (world of hell) as Kannon with great mercy in the role of Roku Kannon.
Sanma yagyo (characteristic things of the Buddha) Symbol is shokatsu renge (a slightly-opened lotus bud).
Shushi (or Shuji (the characteristic one syllable word to depict the Bodhisattva)) (Esoteric Buddhism) are sa, hriiH and so on.
Features of statue and belongings
There are Henge Kannon (The transformations in which Kannon (Deity of Mercy) appears in order to save sentient beings) which has many faces and many arms such as Juichimen Kannon (Eleven-faced Kannon), Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Kannon) and Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion), and Kannon which has one face and two arms and do not have a superhuman figure; the latter is called 'Sho Kannon (聖観音 or 正観音).'
In Esoteric Buddhism, Sho Kannon, Juichimen Kannon, Senju Kannon, Nyoirin Kannon, Bato Kannon (horse-headed Kannon) and Jundei Kannon (Cundi) (or Fukukensaku Kannon (Fukukenjaku Kannon) (Kannon of the Never Empty Lasso) in place of Jundei Kannon) are called 'Roku Kannon.'
The features of Sho Kannon are generally Bosatsu, with one face and two arms as mentioned above, and its Jimotsu (the hand-held attributes of a Buddhist image) is lotus in the left hand, but it is not always uniform.
What is most distinguishable for a Kannon statue is to place a small statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), called Kebutsu (the Artificial Buddha), on the front top part of its head, which is a common characteristic with other Kannon statues such as Senju Kannon.
Kannon' or 'Sho Kannon'
All Kannon statues with one face and two arms are not necessarily called 'Sho Kannon.'
The Kannon statue, which is placed as the left Kyoji (attendant figure) of Amida sanzon (Amida triad), is generally called only 'Kannon Bosatsu statue' and it is limited to being called 'Sho Kannon' when it is enshrined individually.
In addition, there are many cases where even the individual Kannon statue with one face and two arms is not called 'Sho Kannon.'
For example, at Horyu-ji Temple in Nara, there are three National Treasure Kannon statues which are commonly called 'Kudara Kannon' (Kannon of Kudara), 'Yumechigai Kannon' (dream changing Kannon) and 'Kuse Kannon' (Kannon of salvation), and the official names of these three statues at the time of recognition as national treasures were 'the standing statues of Kannon Bosatsu' so that they are not called 'Sho Kannon' as either official names nor as popular names.
Among the so-called Small Gilt Bronze Buddhist Statues, which were widely made mainly during the Nara period, many statues are clearly recognized as Kannon statues because of placing a Kebutsu of Amida Nyorai on the head, but these are usually just called 'Kannon (Bosatsu) statues' instead of 'Sho Kannon' as well.
Among the statues called 'Sho Kannon' in general and by the temple, the statue of the principal image of Buddha at Toin-do of Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture (Nara period, National Treasure), the statue of the principal image of Buddha at Futai-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture (Important Cultural Property) and the statue at Kurama-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture (Important Cultural Property) are famous.
Nyoirin Kannon, cintaamaNicakra in Sanskrit, is a venerable entity of Bosatsu, Bodhisattva, and is worshipped in Buddhism.
It is a transformed figure of Kannon Bosatsu and one of the Roku Kannon (six Kannon).
Sanma yagyo (characteristic things of the Buddha) is Nyoi hoju (a sacred jewel, said to remove suffering, and capable of granting every wish) and a red lotus flower.
Shushi (or Shuji (the characteristic one syllable word to depict the Bodhisattva)) (Esoteric Buddhism) is hriiH.
In Japan it has various names such as 'Nyoirin Kannon Bosatsu,' 'Nyoirin Kanzeon Bosatsu' and 'Daibonjinon Kannon,' and the designated name, such as for an important cultural property, was 'Nyoirin Kannon.'
It is also called 'Kuse (or Guse) Bosatsu.'
Nyoi is an abbreviation of Nyoi hoju, a wish-fulfilling jewel (Cintamani), and Rin is an abbreviation of Horin, Dharma-wheel (cakra) and its true wish is to preach at will, living in zanmai (samadhi) of Nyoi hoju, removing the troubles of living things in Rokudo (six posthumous worlds) and provides benefits to these worlds.
Nyoi hoju fulfills all hopes and Horin is a Buddhist symbol to destroy Bonno (earthly desires), and which was transformed from Chakuram, a weapon in ancient India originally.
As the role of Roku Kannon, it is said to be Sekke (edification) Tenbu (deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another).
All Nyoin Kannon statues are basically seated statues or Hanka (half-lotus posture) statues so that standing statues are not seen.
Many statues have six arms, and are sitting with one knee up, but there are also Hanka statues with two arms, which have totally different figures from the former.
The statues with six arms have Nyoi hoju and Horin, which are origins of its name, in two of the six hands.
Among the works of Nyoirin Kannon in Japan, the principal image of Buddha at Kanshin-ji Temple in Osaka Prefecture is a representative statue with six arms.
Among six hands, its first right hand shows Shiyui-so, meditative posture, with its chin resting upon its hand, and it has Nyoi Hoju in the second right hand in front of its breast and beadroll in the third right hand hanging to the outside.
On the other hand, the first left hand touches the earth, spreading the palm, the second left hand supports Mikaifu renge, unopened lotus and the third left hand supports Horin at its finger tips.
The statue at Kanno-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture, the principal image of Buddha at Kannon-do in Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple), the statue in the main hall of Muro-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture and the statue at Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture are statues with six arms and are the same as the statue at Kanshin-ji Temple.
The statue at Ishiyama-dera Temple in Shiga, which is a Buddhist image not usually shown to the public, has been famous as the Nyoirin Kannon statue with two arms since ancient times.
The principal image of Buddha of Oka-dera Temple in Asuka is also a statue with two arms.
The principal image of Chugu-ji Temple, next to Horyu-ji Temple, is a typical hanka shiyui-zo, a position with the left leg pendent (hanka), the right leg crossed over the left knee, and the fingers of the right hand lightly touching the cheek (shiyui).
This statue has been called a Nyoirin Kannon statue since ancient times, but the name at the time of being shaped is not clear so that it is highly possible that it was made as a statue of Miroku Bosatsu, Maitreya Bodhisattva.
In addition, it was worshipped at Jukuya-ko (the women gather on the 19th of the month to pray for easy delivery and family health and safety on nineteenth night of the lunar calendar) in recent times.

Kokuzo Bosatsu is Ākāśagarbh or Gaganagajja in Sanskrit, and is a Bosatsu that is revered in Buddhism.
The Sanmayogyo Symbol is Hoken (treasured sword) and Nyoi hoju (wish-fulfilling jewel).
Shushi (Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism)) (Shuji) is Trāh.
Known mantras are 'OM vajraratna, OM trāh svāhā' and 'Namah Ākāśagarbhāya, OM arika mari muri svāhā,' known to be used in 'Kokuzo Gumonji-ho,' an incantation method to pray for enhanced memory skills.
Kokuzo' literally means 'to have Koku,' and the Kokuzo Bosatsu is a Bosatsu that has limitless wisdom and compassion like the wide universe.
Therefore, this Bosatsu is worshiped for virtues such as wisdom, knowledge and memory.
The incantation method 'Kokuzo Gumonji-ho' involves chanting mantras 1 million times over 100 days following certain rules, and those who complete this method become able to memorize, understand and never forget all Buddhist texts.
The legend that Kukai secluded himself in the Mikurodo caves at Muroto-misaki Cape to complete Kokuzo Gumonji-ho is well known, and Nichiren also worshiped Kokuzo Bosatsu for 21 days when he started to follow the teachings of Buddha at the age of twelve.
Horin-ji Temple in Arashiyama, Kyoto (Nishikyo Ward Kyoto City) has an event called "thirteen visit," where boys and girls who have turned thirteen visit to receive wisdom from Kokuzo Bosatsu.
It is the central figure of the Garbha-mandala in Kokuzo-in, and is esteemed in Mikkyo as well.
The images hold a Hoken in the right hand and Nyoi-hoju in the left, and some images show their right palm facing downwards in a wish-granting mudra and hold Nyoi-hoju in the left.
The latter image form is found in Honzon for Gumonji-ho and the National Treasure image owned by the Tokyo National Museum has this form.
Major examples of sculptures are the figures in Kakuan-ji Temple, Yamatokoriyama City Nara Prefecture and in Koryu-ji Temple Kodo, Kyoto City.
The wooden Kokuzo Bosatsu standing figure in Horin-ji Temple (Ikaruga-cho) in Ikaruga-cho Nara Prefecture is an old figure from about the seventh century, but it is not clear whether it was called a Kokuzo Bosatsu from the beginning.
The Kudara Kannon in Horyu-ji Temple was called a 'Kokuzo Bosatsu figure' within the temple until the early Meiji Period.
Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu
The Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu is a group of figures consisting solely of Kokuzo Bosatsu.
It expresses the five wisdoms of Koku Bosatsu with 5 Bosatsu figures, and is also said to be a different incarnation of Gochi-nyorai.
The Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu is the Honzon of prayers for good health and prosperity.
The name, direction and body color of the Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu are as follows.
Hokkai Kokuzo (center, white)
Kongo Kokuzo (east, yellow)
Hoko Kokuzo (south, blue)
Renge Kokuzo (west, red)
Goyo Kokuzo (north, black-purple)
An example of sculptures of the Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu are the figures in Jingo-ji Temple Tahoto in Kyoto (early Heian Period, National Treasure).
The Five Major Kokuzo Bosatsu figures in To-ji Kanchi-in Temple, Kyoto (Important Cultural Property) were brought back from Tang by Eun, who was the disciple of one of Kukai's disciples.
The figures of Hokkai, Kongo, Hoko, Renge and Goyo sit on a lotus pedestal on top of a horse, lion, elephant, golden bird and peacock, respectively.
The figures in Kanchi-in Temple were originally in Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) and (Yamashina Ward Kyoto City).
Zao Gongen is a venerable entity worshipped in Buddhism in Japan.
It is an original Buddha of Japan without origins in India, and is known as the principal image of the main hall (Zao-do) of Kinpusen-ji Temple, in Yoshino, Nara Prefecture.
Gongen means 'god or Buddha which appears in a temporary figure.'
There is a tradition that EN no Ozunu (practitioners of Shugen-do (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) around the seventh centuries) transformed to Zao Gongen during ascetic training at Mt. Kinpu in Yoshino.
It is considered to be combined with Shaka, Kannon (Deity of Mercy) and Miroku (Maitreya), and the three statues of Zao Gongen, which have almost the same figures, are enshrined as the principal image at Zao-do in Yoshino.
EN no Ozunu himself was a legendary figure and it is not clear when the statue of Zao Gongen began to be shaped actually.
At Ishiyama-dera Temple in Shiga Prefecture, 'the statue of Kongo Zao' (a deity of fierce aspect) and 'the statue of Shitu-kongo-shin (Shu-kongo-shin)' (Buddhist guardian deity) were enshrined as Kyoji, Attendant figures, of the principal image, Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion).
According to Shoso-in Monjo (documents of Shoso-in (Treasure Repository)), these statues were made in 762 and the names of both Kyoji were 'Shinno' (God-King), so that the name of 'Kongo Zao' was seen in a record from the Heian period for the first time.
The original of these statues does not exist now but Shingi (a wooden core) of the 'Kongo Zao statue' still exists, and its figure with the right hand and right leg high up is similar to later Zao Gongen statues.
Bronze Plaque with Line-engraved Zao Gongen' (in Soji-ji Temple of Nishiarai-taishi Shrine, Tokyo Prefecture) (National Treasure) which was excavated at Yoshino, is a bronze plaque with line-engraved Buddhas including Zao Gongen and has an inscription of 1001, so that it is suggested that the iconography of Zao Gongen had been established before around this time.
According to the theory of syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism, it was considered to be the same god as the Emperor Ankan, so that at the time of separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the Meiji period, many shrines which had enshrined Zao Gongen other than Head Temple Kinpusen-ji Temple determined the Emperor Ankan as Saishin, an enshrined deity.
In addition, the Zao Mountain Range, a member of the one hundred biggest mountains of Japan, which lie on the border between Yamagata Prefecture and Miyagi Prefecture, has been the subject of mountain worship from ancient times so that mountaineering ascetics who believed in Shinto-Buddhist amalgamation of Kukai, came to practice ascetic training around the middle of the Heian period.
The name originated from the fact that Zao Gongen was transferred from Zao-do in Yoshino and enshrined in both Kattadake-jinja Shrine on the top of Mt. Zao and Kattamine-jinja Shrine at the foot.
It is said that Kattamine-jinja Shrine was a temple literally named Kinpusen-ji Temple of Shugen-do which was a mixture of Shinto and Buddhism before the Exclusion of Buddhism in the Meiji period.
In addition, it is said that Zao Gongen of Kattadake-jinja Shrine and Kattamine-jinja Shrine face to Kinpusen-ji Temple of Mt. Omine and Mt. Yoshino.
Going further into the past, the following theory has become influential recently.
The origin of 'Zao Gongen' is appeared that the Emperor Jinmu, considered as the first emperor, subverted Yamato (Wakoku) and Nagasune-hiko, the king of Yamato, was killed then Abi-hiko, his brother, escaped to Tohoku to establish the Tohoku Dynasty and enshrine Nagasune-hiko.
It supports the theory that the flower of bamboo hat for Hanagasa-odori in Yamagata Prefecture is 'cherry' and it is originally a festival to celebrate 'Zao Gongen' and that the sacred tree for Zao faith is 'cherry.'
If we search around Mt. Zao or its northern area carefully, a lot of 'Zao Gongen' can still be seen even now, such as a wooden historical Zao Gongen statue with a height of 4 meters enshrined and hidden in a warehouse.
Kimpusen-ji Temple (Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture) - the standing wooden statues of Zao Gongen (important cultural properties)
Features of Zao Gongen statues are similar to those of Myo (warlike and wrathful deities) statues of Esoteric Buddhism, and they usually show Funnu-so (an angry expression, boiling with anger), lifting the right hand and right leg high up and putting the left hand on the hip.
The most obvious characteristic from the point of view of iconography is to lift the right leg high up so that the whole statue is supported only by the left leg.
(There is also a statue with both feet on the ground such as the statue at Koryu-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture).
The principal image at Oku-no-in of Sanbutsu-ji Temple (Nageire-do) in Tottori Prefecture (Heian period, important cultural property) is one of the representative works.
Hachibushu or Tenryu Hachibushu refers to eight deities who guard Buddhism.
The ancient Indian gods such as the fierce god, the war god, the music god and the animal god, before the dissemination of Buddhism, came to believe in Buddhism and transformed to Goho zenjin (good deities protecting dharma).
Summary
Hachibushu means eight species.
For this, there are various theories.
Usually it means the following eight deities based on mainly 'Sharihotsumon-kyo Sutra,' and 'Hoke-kyo Sutra' and 'Konkomyo Saisho-kyo Sutra' as well; Tenbushu (Deities who reside in a heavenly realm, one of the six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another), Ryushu (Pre-Buddhist snake or dragon deities), Yashashu (a class of semi divine usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classed with malignant spirits), Kendatsubashu (Gandharva), Karurashu (Garuda), Kinnarashu (Kinnara) and Makoragashu (Mahoraga).
However, the names of the famous Hachibushu statues of Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture are different from those above, and according to the temple legend, they are called Gobujo, Sakara (Shagara), Kuhanda, Kendatsuba, Ashura, Karura, Kinnara and Hibakara.
In addition, Hachibukishu (eight fierce gods) who serve Shitenno (the Four Guardian Kings), are often confused with these Hachibushu because they have similar names to Hachibushu and some of them have the same names but they are different deities basically.
Incidentally, Hachibukishu include Kendatsuba, Bishaja, Kuhanda, Heireita, Naga, Futanna, Yasha and Rasetsu (Rakshasa).
In Jobon (chapter 1, Introductory) of Hoke-kyo Sutra, the names of these Hachibushu are seen as 'nonhuman entities' in addition to 'humans' such as Biku (Buddhist priest), Bikuni (female Buddhist disciple), Ubasoku (upasaka) and Ubai (upasika) (devout men and women lay follower of Buddhism) as the audience.
Ten, Deva

It is said that it eats fragrance and is a guardian god of soma, the alcohol of the gods, as well.
In Buddhism, it is seen a music god of kenzoku (disciples or followers of Taishakuten).

The statues of Hachibushu in Kofuku-ji Temple
As works of the Hachibushu statues in Japan, the statues at former Saikon-do (an image hall situated to the west of a pagoda in the temple grounds) of Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture (Nara period, national treasures) are well known.
Besides them, sometimes Hachibushu are drawn on pictures with other disciples of Shakyamuni, such as Nehan-zu (Nirvana painting), and their statues including Ashura are seen in statues on the north side of the first story of Goju-no-to (five-storey pagoda) of Horyu-ji Temple, which show nirvana of Shaka, but other statues are rarely seen.
Nijuhachibushu, the twenty-eight attendants which are Kenzoku of Senju Kannon (Sahasrabhuja-arya-avalokites 'vara, "Thousand-armed Kannon") (representative works in Japan are statues at Sanjusangendo Temple and those at Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto Prefecture) include statues of Hachibushu.
The Hachibushu statues of Kofuku-ji Temple are made by kanshitsu-zukuri, which is a technique of pasting hemp clothes in layers with lacquer were and had been placed at Saikon-do hall which was abolished later.
Saikon-do was build by Empress Komyo in 734 for the memorial service of her late mother TACHIBANA no Michiyo, and is known that the Shaka triad as the principal image, as well as statues of Bonten and Taishakuten, Hachibushu statues, the statue of Judai deshi (the Ten Chief Disciples of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni) were placed.
Kofuku-ji Temple Mandala picture' in the Kyoto National Museum (from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the Kamakura period, important cultural property) shows that each two statues of Hachibushu were placed at the right and left in the front and rear of the principal image respectively.
The statues at Saikon-do of Kofuku-ji Temple including Hachibushu are interpreted to have been produced based on Konkomyo saisho-kyo (Golden Light Sutra of the Most Victorious Kings) instead of Jobon of Hoke-kyo Sutra.
A summary account of the Hachibushu statues in Kofuku-ji Temple is as follows.
The statue of Gobujo - Shikikukyoten (heaven of the most rarefied form) in the highest grade of Shikikai and Gobujo Goten, a Tenbu of the lower grade.
It is shaped to put on a crown with an elephant's head and an expression like a boy.
The statue of Kofuku-ji Temple is badly damaged and only the head and a part of the upper body are remained (besides this, the right hand of this statue is in the possession of Tokyo National Museum, which was donated by an individual owner in 1904 to the then Imperial Museum).
It seems to be the statue which corresponds to 'Ten' in scriptures.
Among Nijuhachibushu of Senju Kannon's Kenzoku, there is the statue of 'Gobujo Goten,' and some of them are of war gods with a sword in each hand, including in Sanjusangendo Temple and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera Temple.
The statue of Sakatsura - it is shaped as a figure where a snake is wound around from the top of the head to the upper body and it has a sad look on its face like a boy.
This statue is considered to be the statue which corresponds to 'dragon' in scriptures.
However, there is a theory that the state of Sakatsura in Kofuku-ji Temple corresponds to 'Makoraga' instead of 'dragon.'
It appears in the name of 'Sakatsura Ryuo' among Nijuhachibushu.
The statue of Kuhanda - it is shaped in the expression of anger with its hair stood on end and its eyes narrow.
It is considered to be the statue which corresponds to 'Yasha' in scriptures.
It is also said to be Kenzoku of Zochoten, Virudhaka, among Shitenno.
There is no statue which corresponds to Kuhanda among Nijuhachibushu.
The statue of Kendatsuba - it puts on armor and a lion crown.
Both eyes are almost closed.
The statue of Ashura - it is shaped as a figure with three faces and six arms.
The Ashura statue of Kofuku-ji Temple is famous, and often appears in posters and brochures for sightseeing in Nara.
The statue of Karura - the statue of Kofuku-ji Temple wears armor with a bird's head and a human body.
Different from this, the statues of Karura among Nijuhachibushu at Sanjusangendo Temple and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera Temple have wings and blow a whistle.
As the temple legend, the statue of Kinnara - it has a horn on the head and seems to have been made as the statue of Kinnara from the very beginning.
The statue of Hibakara - it is shaped as a somewhat older face with a beard, different from other statues.
It is said to correspond to 'Makoraga' in scripture, but not sure.
There are both Hibakara and Makoraga among Nijuhachibushu, and the former is expressed as the statue of a war god in a common style while the latter is expressed as the statue who plays the Japanese lute with five eyes.
Juniten is a mixture of the twelve deities of 'Ten,' which are Goho Zenshin (good deities protecting dharma) in Buddhism and is given high value in Esoteric Buddhism, as well as Shitenno (Four Guardian Kings).
Origin
Ten' or the image of Tenbu in Buddhism was established by the historical process where the gods in Indian myths and Brahmanism were incorporated into Buddhism and became Goho Zenshin.
Juniten was determined to be the eight Ten which guard the eight directions of north, south, east, west, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest, adding four gods related to heaven, earth, the sun and the moon, and consists of twelve deities of Ishanaten (Isana), Taishakuten (Indra), Katen (Agni), Emmaten (Yama), Rasetsuten (Rakshasa), Suiten (Varuna), Futen (Vayu), Bishamonten (Vaisravana), Bonten (Brahma, Brahman), Jiten (Prithivi), Nitten (Surya, Aditya) and Gatten (Candra).
In Japan it has been shaped since the 9th century during the Heian period.
The direction that each deity guards and each Sanskrit name are as follows.
Directions
Ishanaten (Northeast) (Isana)
Taishakuten (East) (wIndra)

Works in Japan
The major characteristic of Juniten is as 'Gohoshin', a guardian deity of directions.
Most of the works are pictures rather than sculptures and pictures drawn on Kakejiku (hanging scroll) or Byobu (a folding screen consisting of multiple, joined panels) were used as guardian deities of dojo, where important prayers and austerities, and Buddhist ceremonies were held.
The picture of Juniten in the Kyoto National Museum (which was in the possession of To-ji Temple) (later part of the Heian period, in 1127, national treasure) is Kakejiku on which each Juniten is drawn, and is a representative Buddhist picture which has the sensitive and graceful style of dynasty.
This was used at Goshichinichi-no-mishiho (a ritual held at Shingon-in in Imperial Palace to pray for the Emperor's health).
The picture of Juniten at Saidai-ji Temple in Nara (beginning of the Heian period, national treasure) is the oldest Juniten image in Japan, and was drawn in the 9th century and each deity sits on birds and animals such as buffalo and turtle, while each deity in the picture in the Kyoto National Museum sits on carpet.
Many works, in which each Juniten deity was drawn as a standing figure on a pair of folding screens with six panels, remain, and these were used in order to guard dojo such as Denpo Kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma), an important ritual in Esoteric Buddhism.
As a Byobu of Juniten, the example in To-ji Temple, which was drawn during the Kamakura period, is particularly well known.
In addition, Juniten also appears as a member of the Buddhas which make up the Mandala.
Among Ryokai-mandala (mandala of the two realms), Juniten is included in the Buddhas of Saige-in (outer court) on Garbha-mandala (Gekongobu-in).
Moreover, Juniten Mandala, on which Juniten is placed around a Fudo Myo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) image with four arms, is used in anchin-ho, an esoteric rite for achieving peace and security of the state.
The wooden statue at Muryo-ji Temple in Gamagori City, Aichi Prefecture, which is a rare Juniten statue, seems to have been shaped as a part of a cubic diagram of Mandala.
Besides these, there are Juniten masks (latter part of the Heian period, important cultural properties) in the Kyoto National Museum, which were in the possession of To-ji Temple.
At the time of ritual of Denpo Kanjo in the Heian period, people who put on Juniten's masks and costumes appeared in the 'March of Juniten' but it was changed to Byobu of Juniten after medieval times.
Shonyo (December 23, 1516 - September 19, 1554) was a priest of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
He was the 10th head priest of Hongan-ji Temple.
His posthumous name was Kokyo.
He was a grandson of Rennyo and a son of Ennyo (who was not included among successive head priests because he had died before succession from his father Jitsunyo).
His mother was a daughter of Renjun, the sixth son of Rennyo.
In 1525 he became the 10th chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple at the age of 10 due to the death of his grandfather, Jitsunyo, and was placed under the guardianship of Renjun, who was a brother of Jitsunyo and his maternal grandfather.
In 1527, in order to promote friendship between the Hongan-ji religious group and the central government and to achieve peace and security, he approached the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) and became an adopted child of Hisatsune KUJO, a chief adviser to the Emperor.
In 1531, a conflict within the Hongan-ji religious group occurred (it is called the Kyoroku-Tenbun War (Kyoroku-Tenbun Rebellion) including the later incidents until when Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple was burned down), but Syonyo resolved this conflict and made efforts to strengthen the leadership of Hoshu (high priest).
The following year (1532), he mobilized his followers to subvert Motonaga Miyoshi at the request of Harumoto HOSOKAWA, who held the post of Kanrei (shogunal deputy); however, in fear of the power held by Hongan-ji Temple, Harumoto attacked and burned down Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple, which was home to the Hongan-ji Temple school at that time, in cooperation with the Nichiren sect groups and Sadayori ROKKAKU (this incident is known as the Tenbun-hokke Riot).
Shyono, who escaped from Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple, moved to Ishiyama Gobo (branch temple) in Osaka and made Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple the new home of the group.
After that, he made peace with Harumoto by making his first son Kennyo marry Nyoenni, an adopted daughter of Harumoto (the youngest daughter of Sadaijin (minister of the left) Kinyori SANJO. Her eldest sister married Harumoto and her second eldest sister married Shingen TAKEDA), and built rapport with the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to mend the relationship with the central government and promote strengthening of the system of Hongan-ji Temple.
Having learnt his lesson with the Tenbun-hokke riot, he also ordered followers of the Ikko Ikki (League of the Single-Minded, established by members of Jodo-shinshu) school of Buddhism in various places not to riot without good reason.
In 1549 he was given "Sanjurokunin-shu" (Collected Poems of Thirty-six Poets) by Emperor Gonara.
Later, in the days of Shonyo's son Kennyo, the book was to have been given to Sakihisa KONOE, the former chief adviser to the emperor who had worked to bring about peace during the Ishiyama War, but he refused to accept it on the grounds that 'a national treasure should not be given away without good reason,' and the book has been in the possession of Hongan-ji Temple as a national treasure ever since.
In addition, during the days of Shonyo, Hongan-ji Temple began to intervene even more actively on behalf of their followers in the Hokuriku region by acting as a mediator in the Kaga Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Kaga), and to strengthen the control of their followers in the region, they built a Gobo in Kanazawa City in 1546, but they did not fully succeed in their aim during Shonyo's lifetime as a result of a conflict with the Asakura clan.
In 1554 he died at the young age of 39, and his eldest son Kennyo succeeded him at the age of 12.
Junnyo (August 3, 1577 - January 21, 1632) was an individual from the Azuchi-Momoyama period and Edo period.
He was the 12th Monshu (a head priest) of Hongan-ji Temple.
He was the third son of Kennyo, the 11th Monshu, and a brother of Kyonyo.
His imina (a personal name) was Kosho.
Triggered by Junnyo's succession to Monshu, instead of his brother, who was at odds with their father, Hongwan-ji Temple split into east and west.
In the Ishiyama War, his father Kennyo made peace with Nobunaga ODA and departed from Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple to Saginomori of Kii Province in 1580.
After that, Kennyo moved to Osaka Tenma, upon being given the land of a temple by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and moved to Shichijo Horikawa in Kyoto (the present location of Hongan-ji Temple) after being given land again by Hideyoshi again in 1591.
As a result, Junnyo also came to Kyoto and, when Kennyo died the following year (1592), he succeeded to Kennyo's position, becoming the 12th Monshu of Hongan-ji Temple in 1593.
Nishi Hongan-ji Temple claimed that Junnyo's brother Kyonyo was basically at odds with their father, as was evident when he withdrew to Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in 1580 despite his father having given up his resistance to the Oda clan, and he was closely watched by Hideyoshi as well when he succeeded Oda Nobunaga, so it was natural that Rennyo became the next Monshu.
Kenson, the second son of Kennyo (half brother of Kyonyo) supported Junnyo as his guardian, forcing his daughter to marry him.
It is said that succession to the position of Monshu by Junnyo, the third son, was eventually realized when his mother turned to Hideyoshi, who was then a vassal of Nobunaga, for help.
It is said that Junnyo was at odds with his half-brother Kyonyo as well (there is, however, another theory that suggests his mother may have shared the same mother as Junnyo, Nyoshun-ni).
However, after Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, who defeated the Toyotomi family, supported Kyonyo and gave land for a temple in Karasuma Shichijo to Kyonyo in 1602, which led to the establishment of Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple.
For this reason, the Hongwan-ji Temple in Shichijo Horikawa, which Junnyo succeeded, became to be called Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, which led to the east-west split of the Honganji Buddhist Sect.
After that, Junnyo assumed daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order) by Imperial order in 1608 and made efforts to broaden the influence of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, building Tsumura Betsuin branch temple in Osaka and Tsukiji Betsuin branch temple in Edo.
Senju Kannon, sahasrabhuja aaryaavalokitezvara in Sanskrit, is a venerable entity of Bosatsu, Bodhisattva, which is worshipped in Buddhism.
Sahasrabhuja' means 'a thousand arms' literally.
This name is a synonym of Durga, a goddess in Hinduism as well, and Senju Kannon is considered to be a transformed body of Kannon Bodhisattva, Kannon Bosatsu, which was established in India under influence of Hinduism.
It is one of Roku Kannon (6 Kannon).
Sanmayagyo Symbol is an opened lotus (lotus flower in full bloom. A pair of shokatsu renge (slightly-opened lotus buds) of Sho kannon (Holy Deity of Mercy)) and renge-jo (on lotus) nyoi hoju (a sacred jewel, said to remove suffering, and capable of granting every wish).
Shushi (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism) (Shuji) is hriiH.
Commentary
In Japanese there are various names such as 'Juichimen Senju Kannon' (Eleven-faced and thousand-armed kannon), 'Senju Sengen Kannon' (Thousand-armed and thousand-eyed kannon), 'Juichimen Senju Sengen Kannon' (Eleven-faced, thousand-armed and thousand-eyed kannon) and 'Senju Senpi Kannon' (Thousand-armed and thousand-elbowed kannon).
The name of 'Senju-sengen' originates from the fact that it has one eye in each palm of a thousand arms.
A thousand arms indicate the vastness of Kannon's mercy and power as endeavors to relieve every living things.
The reason why Kannon Bosatsu have a thousand arms is written in "Senju-sengen Kanzeon Bosatsu Kodaienman Muge Daihishin Darani-kyo Sutra" (Nilakanta (ka) -sutra) translated by Gabon-Datsuma (Bhagavaddharma).
Daihishin Dharani (Great Compassionate Heart Dharani) in this sutra has been recited at Zen sect temples in China and Japan up until the current time.
As one of the Roku Kannon, it is said to provide salvation for the dead in Gaki-do (the Realm of the Hungry Dead), which is one the Rokudo (the six realms of existence).
In addition, it is also said to relieve suffering in hell and control the achievement of various wishes and peaceful birth by showing that there is a benefit of no obstacle (無礙の大用) for relief of all living things.
Names
There are various honorific names of Senju Kannon as above.
Among Senju Kannon statues, there is a statue with 27 faces instead of 11 faces, so that 'Juichimen Senju-sengen Kannon' is not always true.
In addition, the designated name for national treasure and important cultural property based on the Act on Protection of Cultural Properties is unified to 'Senju Kannon.'
In Mandala (Mandala, or a diagram that depicts Buddhist deities according to certain geometric formats and illustrates the Buddhist world view) in Mikkyo, Kannon statues are classified to 'Renge-bu' (Lotus Family).
It means that Senju Kannon is also called 'Rengeo' (lotus king) because it is a king of Kannon, so that the name of Rengeoin (the formal name of Sanjusangendo Temple in Kyoto) originates from this.
Features of Statue
Although there exist both seated statues and standing statues, and statues with a thousand arms actually, generally it has 11 faces and 42 arms (the statue of principal image of Buddha, at Dojo-ji Temple in Wakayama is an exception with 44 arms).
The 42 arms is explained as follows; the 40 hands except two clasped hands in prayer at the front of the breast relieve each of the 25 worlds, that is, '25X40=1,000.'
The '25 worlds' here means 'three realms and twenty-five forms of existence' in Buddhism which is a thought that there are 25 worlds from heaven to hell (it is considered that there are 14 forms in Yokkai (the realm of desire), 7 forms in Shikikai (the realm of form) and 4 forms in Mushikikai (the realm of non-form).
Incidentally, 'Uchoten' means the heaven on the top of Twenty-five forms of existence.
The statue of principal image at Sanjusangendo Temple in Kyoto (seated statue) is a representative work of Tankei, a Busshi (a sculptor of Buddhist statues) in the Kamakura period and is a typical statue with 11 faces and 42 arms.
The two hands among 42 hands are joined in prayer in front of the breast and in the other two hands brought together in front of stomach there is Hohatsu (a bowl used by Buddhist monks for meals, and as a begging bowl) (this is called Hohatsu-shu (hands for Hohatsu)).
In the other 38 hands there are various Jimotsu (the hand-held attributes of a Buddhist image) such as Horin (Dharma-wheel (cakra)), Shakujo (pewter staff) and Suibyo (water jug).
Jimotsu with 38 hands is different from statues and is not necessarily uniform.
In addition, some Jimotsu were often lost through the years or changed to supply materials in later age.
The statue at the main hall of the Toshodai-ji Temple in Nara (standing statue), the statue of principal image in Fujii-dera Temple in Osaka and the statue of principal image in Juho-ji Temple in Kyoto are works which actually expressed a thousand arms.
The statue at Toshodai-ji Temple, which is over 5 m high, has 42 big arms and many small arms (it is said that 953 arms remain) in the spaces between the big arms.
The statue at Fujii-dera Temple has 40 big arms (with no Hohatsu-shu) and 1,001 small arms.
When viewed from the front, the small arms of the statue in Fujii-dera Temple appear to be coming directly out of the body, but they are actually attached to two column supports that stand just behind the statue.
The remaining traces of eyes painted on the palms of the large and small arms of the statue at Fujii-dera Temple demonstrate that the statue once had literally 'a thousand arms and a thousand eyes'.
Faith and Examples of Statues in Japan
While Senju Kannon statues are hardly found in India, there are remains in China such as Longmen Caves from the Tang Dynasty.
In Japan, Senju Kannon began to be worshipped in an early age and it had been shaped into a statue since the Nara period before Kukai transmitted pure esotericism.
It was known that Senju-do hall was built in Todai-ji Temple from 729 to 749 and Senju Kannon statue was placed in its Kodo (Lecture Hall) which does not exist now.
Among existing works in Japan, the statue at Fujii-dera Temple, which is considered to have been made in the middle of the 8th century, is recognized as the oldest work, and the statue at Toshodai-ji Temple is a work from the end of the 8th century to the beginning of the 9th century.
A badly damaged statue of Senju Kannon was discovered in the body of Kitamuki (north-faced) principal image, a hidden Buddhist statue, at Dojo-ji Temple in Wakayama, which seems to be the principal image from the early age of Dojo-ji Temple during the Nara period.
Besides these, Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Sanjusangendo Temple and Kokawa-dera Temple, a pilgrim stamp office of the Saigoku (western part of Japan), are famous for enshrining Senju Kannon.

Risshu sect is one the sects of Buddhism which research and practice commandments.
Risshu Sect in China
Unlike in Japan, learning commandments was necessary for becoming an official priest in China, so that commandments had been researched from ancient times.
It is said that in the period of the Tang Dynasty, Dosen, who founded the Nanzan-risshu sect, completed the study of the commandments and that Ganjin, who learned from Dosen's disciple, transmitted the commandments to Japan, as requested by Japanese priests who had studied in China.
Risshu Sect in Japan
In Japan, commandments were introduced at a comparatively early stage in an incomplete way, so that their significance was not understood fully and they were researched in only a portion of the temples without any Jukai (rituals handing down the precepts).
In 753, Ganjin came to Japan from Tang after six voyages and established Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) at Todai-ji Temple and conferred commandments to the people such as the retired Emperor Shomu and Emperor Shotoku for the first time in Japan.
He later devoted himself to research on the commandments at the base of Toshodai-ji Temple, and this sect still exists today as one of Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara).
Although Ganjin transmitted 'Shibun-ritsu' (Four-Part Vinayapitaka, which explains about regulations and prohibited matters of the priests), Saicho and Kukai in the Heian period did not support it and Kukai put high value on 'Juju-ritsu' (Ten-Reciting Vinayapitaka).
Therefore, the concept on commandments was decentralized so that Risshu sect declined.
In addition, although vowing to follow the precepts was often implemented around Todai-ji Temple and Enryaku-ji Temple, it became only a way to obtain a certificate as an official priest and lost substance.
From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, Shippan and Myoe discussed the renaissance of the commandments, and subsequently Kakujo, Ugon (Yugon), Ensei and Eison implemented vowing to follow the precepts without depending on Kaidan which related to the state in 1236.
While Kakujo emphasized 'Shibun-ritsu' and revived Toshodai-ji Temple as the base of restoration of the Risshu sect later, Enson founded the Shingon Risshu sect around 'Juju-ritsu' of the Shingon sect at the base of Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).
Moreover, Shunjo at Senyu-ji Temple in Kyoto brought back a new Risshu sect from the Southern Sungs.
Therefore, there were three kinds of Risshu sect for 'Hokkyo-ritsu' by Shunjo, Toshodaiji school and Saidaiji school (Shingon Risshu sect) which were called 'Nankyo-ritsu.'
In some cases, these three reformist groups are called 'Shingi-ritsu' (new Risshu sect) and are distinguished from the former 'Kogi-ritsu' (old Risshu sect)
However, as a result, discussions and intercommunion among the three groups of this Shingi-ritsu promoted deepening and restored the Risshu sect, so that it was put to high value during medieval times, and called 'Zen-ritsu' combining the Zen sect and the Risshu sect.
In the Muromachi period it declined again pressed by the Zen sect, but in the Edo period, Myonin, Yuson and Eun appeared and insisted on the renaissance of the commandments.
Besides, in the early Meiji period all Risshu temples except Toshodai-ji Temple belonged to the Shingon sect, but they became independent as the Risshu sect in 1900.
The main dharma is the research and practice of commandments.
Toshodai-ji Temple
A pagoda is a Buddhist building derived from the ancient Indian stupa.
The Sanskrit word 'stupa' was transliterated into Japanese as 'sotoba' and this became abbreviated to 'toba' and simply 'to.'
A stupa is a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics which was transmitted to China during the Han Dynasty and became influenced by the architecture of the wooden buildings of the time.
It was during this period that the word 'to' became used to describe stupa.
The stupa later made its way to Japan.
Many pagodas in Japan including the five-storey, three-storey and two-storey forms are made of wood (such as Japanese cypress).
Despite the wide variation of shapes, all retain the significance of the original stupa.
A large number were constructed using funds donated by Buddhist followers.
To
To' is an abbreviation of 'sotoba' or 'toba' and originally referred to five-storey and three-storey pagodas but came to refer to any tall, narrow structure which tapers to a point at the top such as Tokyo Tower.
The words 'soto' and 'tasoto' often refer to pagodas with two or more storeys such as two-storey, three-storey or five-storey pagodas/
Relatively short pagodas such as three-storey and five-storey varieties are often made of wood but many of the taller ones such as the thirteen-story pagoda at Tanzan-jinja Shrine are made of stone.
There are also small three-storey and five-storey pagodas that are placed in gardens.
The word 'tacchu' originally referred to the 'to no hotori' (grave of a temple founder or high priest) erected by the disciples of a founding priest or Zen temple high priest following his death, or a small temple constructed in the grounds of a larger Zen temple.
Tacchu' as well as the word 'toin' later came to refer to a sub-temple built within the grounds of another temple to serve as the residence of a high priest in his retirement.
The word 'tacchu' is also written using alternative characters.
In Chinese Zen temples, it was originally the practice that the head priest would reside with the monks at the eastern or western so-do hall after he retired.
As time passed and small temples were built within the grounds of larger temples, these became inhabited but these were limited to a single Zen monk per building.
This Chinese custom reached Japan and these buildings came to be seen as permanent sub-temples that served as the graves of individuals, such as the founding priest, who were particularly important to a Zen temple to create the uniquely Japanese concept of the 'tacchu.'
There were also tacchu that acquired their own patron and estate, and were kept running by the disciples.
Kyoso Hanjaku means evaluation of Buddhist scriptures, and was practiced in regions where Buddhist scriptures using Chinese characters were used, including China, for the purpose of evaluating and interpreting Buddhist scriptures based on the height and depth of their contents.
It is also called Kyohan for short.
Shaka preached many teachings during around 45 year period after he attained enlightenment and until he entered nirvana.
These teachings were compiled into scriptures in later years.
After many scriptures had been introduced into China and compiled into Buddhist scriptures using Chinese characters, they were distinguished, according to Chinese-style interpretation of Shaka's teaching, based on their contents and the era of original teachings and monks sought perfect Satori (enlightenment) in unobstructed cultivation of Buddhism from such scriptures.
This is the origin of Kyoso Hanjaku and it was introduced into Japan, Korea and Vietnam as northern-route Buddhism.
Currently, however, it is widely criticized and cited as proof of the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha's teachings because the era of creation of each scripture is specified to a certain extent and the fact that the Mahayana Sutra is not Shaka's direct teaching but one created in later years is well known.
Therefore, classification of the Buddhist Doctrines known as "Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings" (to be mentioned later) is generally rejected as being imperfect or incorrect.
However, even the oldest portion of Theravada Buddhism's tripitaka is assumed to have been compiled only 100 years after Shaka's demise and there exist no scriptures that have been confirmed as those handed down from Shaka's direct teachings.
At that time, however, there were no methods other than Kyoso Hanjaku to distinguish the many scriptures because all Buddhist scriptures, regardless of south route or north route, were believed to be the direct teachings of Shaka.
In this connection, some monks still try to conduct Kyoso Hanjaku under the pretext of the history of creation of scriptures, independent of the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha, from the standpoint that even though many of scriptures do not directly derive from Shaka's teachings, they cannot be completely bogus since each scripture should have been created and developed based on the original Shaka's teachings.
Block of Tibetan Buddhist Scriptures (Tibet, Mongolia, Ching)
In Tibet, the introduction of Buddhism was carried out as a national project during the period from the end of the 8th century to the 9th century and various Buddhist traditions that then existed in India were introduced in one swoop in a short period.
In translating Buddhist scriptures, preparation of the proper Tibetan vocabulary and grammar required for correct translation from Sanskrit was conducted beforehand and as a result, Daizo-kyo Sutra (the Tripitaka) of Tibetan Buddhism are much more streamlined, such as the existence of a single translation of a particular scripture and unified word selection of the same notion used in various scriptures, compared with Buddhist scriptures using Chinese characters.
Under such circumstances, a study of Buddhist scriptures in Tibetan Buddhism was conducted from the viewpoint of how to rationally systematize a group of scriptures which also includes partially contradictory wordings.
In China, the problem concerning which are the real teachings of Shaka arose because Buddhist teachings were highly diversified due to too many scriptures being introduced.
Under such circumstances, it was widely thought that the root of such differences in the contents of scriptures was the difference of the era and contents of Shaka's original teachings and a variety of Kyoso Hanjaku, a method for distinguishing the era of Shaka's preachings as well as judging the supreme teachings among them, were practiced by various sects.
The oldest Kyohan is believed to be the one practiced by Dosho and it is categorized into four kinds as shown below.
Zenjo-horin - Shaka preached to lay believers.
Hoben-horin - Shaka preached to Zraavaka, Pratyekabuddha and Bodhisattva.
Shinjitsu-horin - Shaka preached Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra).
Muyo-horin - Shaka preached Daihatusnaion-kyo Sutra (only first half of Nehan-gyo Sutra (the Nirvana Sutra) translated by Hokken).
Next, Ekan exhorted Kyohan, called the Fivefold Periods.
Shaka preached Shitai Tenporin (literally, spinning the dharma wheel and metaphorically to 'expounding the truth' of Four Noble Truths) at Sarnath.
Shaka preached Mahaprajnaparamita-sutra at various places.
Shaka preached Yuima-gyo (Vimalakirti Sutra) and Bontenyakushi-kyo (Brahmapariprccha Sutra) at various places.
Shaka preached Hoke-kyo sutra at Ryojusen Mountain (Griddhakuta).
Shaka preached Daihatsu Nehan-gyo (the Nirvana Sutra) at a grove of sal trees.
Ekan was believed to have established Fivefold Periods and founded the origin of the Fivefold Periods Kyohan.
Both Dosho and Ekan were the principal disciples of Kumaraju, who translated Hoke-kyo Sutra.
Although there is a difference between them in their interpretation of Nehan-gyo, and Ekan once criticized Dosho, both judged the Nirvana Sutra to be the supreme scripture in their Kyohan.
As far as the Fivefold Periods Kyohan is concerned, that of the Tendai sect is famous today but its origin is the Fivefold Periods as exhorted by Ekan.
Based on this, a variety of Kyoso-hanjaku were practiced.
Therefore, the origin of 'Fivefold Periods Kyohan and Eight Teachings' of the Tendai sect can be traced back to Dosho and Ekan.
Thesis of Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings (Tendai)
Kyohan based on Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings, or the thesis of Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings, is what Chigi (538 - 597) of Mt. Tendai divided Issai-kyo Sutra (complete Buddhist scriptures) into Fivefold Periods and Eight Teachings.
Saicho introduced it into Japan.
Nichiren adopted it as the basis of his advocacy that Hoke-kyo Sutra is the supreme scripture.
Fivefold Periods
According to this thesis, Shaka preached Kegon-kyo Sutra (Avatamska Sutra) first but as it was too difficult for people to understand, he preached Agon-kyo Sutra (Agama Sutra) next which was easier.
Shaka, then preached Hodo-kyo Sutra (Vaipulya Sutra) and Hannya-kyo Sutra (Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra) depending on peoples' level of understanding and during the final 8 years, he preached Hoke-kyo Sutra and Nehan-gyo.
As a conclusion, this thesis asserted that Hoke-kyo Sutra, which Shaka finally preached, was the most important teaching.
Based on duration, Eza (place where Shaka preached) and scripture, D are sorted out as follows.

Contents - Shoso (Curds), Zen-kyo (including Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo) that advocates the comparison of 4 teachings of Daizo-kyo, Tsu-kyo (Shared Teaching), Betsu-kyo and En-kyo and the teaching of danka (to scold).
The Period of Hannya-kyo (Prajna)
Duration - 14 years (some assert it was 22 years)
Eza - 16 meetings at 4 places including Ryojusen Mountain nearby Rajagrha in Magadh.
Scripture - Daihannya-kyo (Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra), Kongohannya-kyo Sutra (Diamond Sutra) and Hannya Shin-gyo (Heart Sutra), and so on.
Contents - Jukuso (Butter), Zen-kyo that advocates En-kyo with Tsu-kyo and Betsu-kyo mixing (including Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo) and the teaching of tota (to select).
The Period of Hokke Nehan-gyo (Lotus Nirvana)
Duration - 8 years (1 day 1 night as for Nehan-gyo Sutra)
Eza - 3 meetings at 2 places including Ryojusen Mountain nearby Rajagrha in Magadh (Hoke-kyo Sutra) and under a sal tree along the Ajitavati River in Kushinagar (Nehan -gyo Sutra).
Scripture - Hokke Sanbu-kyo Sutra (The Threefold Lotus Sutra) centered on Hoke-kyo Sutra 28 chapters and Nehan-gyo Sutra.
Contents - Daigo (Ghee), Ton-kyo that advocates En-kyo (no Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo) and the teaching of kaie (to reveal).
However, the above time-series classification was made simply based on the time, descriptions relevant to time and places that are described in scriptures together with their contents, it does not necessarily mean that Shaka actually preached in this order.
In this connection, Nichiren said in his Shugo Kokka-ron (Treatise on protection of the nation); 'The above is a summary of voluminous sutra.
Concerning various sutras of Mahayana and Hinayana other than this, their histories are definitely confirmed and there is a possibility that Shaka preached Kegon-kyo Sutra after Agon-kyo Sutra or he preached Hodo-kyo Sutra and Hannya-kyo Sutra after Hoke-kyo Sutra.
As the meanings of them are analogous, they should be treated together.'
Therefore, attention should be paid to the fact that Shaka preached his teachings taking into account people's patience (ability to listen to or understand his teachings) and as the term taiki-seppo (the best suitable expression of the teaching for the target audience) and Rinki Ohen (the best suitable action according to circumstances) indicate, he preached not necessarily in sequence.
From the viewpoint of the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha as well as the history of scriptures, attention also should be paid to the fact that even Nichiren admitted the history of sutras was not confirmed while he adopted the Fivefold Periods thesis which Chigi had determined.
Therefore, although some members of the current Buddhist community reject the Fivefold Periods thesis as wrong, it cannot be denied completely.
In this connection, Chigi asserted that the content of Nehan-gyo Sutra was almost the same as that of Hoke-kyo Sutra, and its truth had already been clarified in Hoke-kyo Sutra and therefore, it was preached only for the purpose of rescuing people who had been left out from Hoke's rescue.
Based on this standpoint, Chigi further asserted that, rather than separating Nehan (nirvana) and Hoke, he classified them together in the 'Hoke-Nehan period' because Nehan was preached only for one day and one night, while Hoke was preached for 8 years; judging from the content and the place of preaching while the period of preaching from the Kegon-kyo and Hoke-kyo sutras were unknown, however, the Nehan-gyo Sutra are the only teachings that Shaka preached when he was dying.
Gomisosho-no-tatoe (The five flavors, or stages of making ghee, which is said to be a cure for all ailments; it is a Tiantai illustration of the five periods of the Buddha's teaching)
Chigi also linked Fivefold Periods, Kegon, Agon, Hodo, Hannya and Hoke-Nehan, to Five Flavors, fresh milk, cream, curds, butter and ghee, that are advocated by Nehan-gyo Sutra as Gomisosho-no-tatoe.
Nyuso = Kegon
Rakuso = Agon
Shoso = Hodo
Jukuso = Hannya
Daigo = Hoke-Nehan
This is well-known as Daigo-no-tatoe (analogy of Daigo).
However, the above description of Nehan-gyo Sutra solely advocates that Nehan-gyo Sutra is the ultimate and supreme sutra among all sutras and strictly speaking, Hoke-kyo Sutra does not appear in this description.
Precisely, the description of Nehan-gyo Sutra says 'a cow creates nyu (fresh milk), nyu creates rakuso, rakuso creates jukuso (salpis, which is the word origin of Calpis (Japanese milk-based soft drink) and jukuso creates ghee and similarly in the teaching of Buddhism, Buddha creates Junibu-kyo Sutra (the Twelve Divisions of Scriptures), Junibu-kyo Sutra creates Shutara (sutra), Shutara creates Hodo-kyo Sutra, Hodo-kyo sutra creates Hannya Haramitsu (prajnaparamita) and Hannya Haramitsu creates Dainehan-kyo Sutra' (the Nirvana Sutra).
Strictly speaking, therefore, linkage is (presumed to be) as follows.
Nyu = Junibu-kyo Sutra
Rakuso = Shutara
Shoso = Hodo-kyo Sutra
Jukuso = Hannya Haramitsu
Daigo = Dainehan-kyo Sutra
Chigi linked Fivefold Periods and Five Flavors by his intelligent inspiration.
By people belonging to the Buddhist academy, however, much criticism has been raised against his interpretation which judges that Nehan-gyo Sutra is inferior to Hoke-kyo Sutra, asserting that he twisted the argument too much in favor of Hoke-kyo Sutra from his standpoint regarding Hoke-kyo Sutra's superiority.
Eight Teachings
Eight teachings are divided into Kegi-no-shikyo (Shakamuni's four modes of instruction) and Keho-no-shikyo (Shakamuni's four kinds of teaching the content of the Truth, accommodated to the capacity of his disciples).
Kegi-no-shikyo
Kegi-no-shikyo is the categorization of Shaka's teachings based on the form of teaching to guide people (such as rites) with the calling of such form as Gi.
Ton-kyo (ton means immediately and Ton-kyo are the teachings which Buddha preached immediately after he attained Satori regardless of people's patience)
Zen-kyo (zen means gradually and Zen-kyo is the teaching which Buddha preached stepwise from shallow teachings to deep teachings depending on people's patience)
Himitsu-kyo (Its correct name is Himitsu Fujo-kyo and it is the teaching which Shaka preached in order to give indefinite benefits separately (individually) to people whose patience is different while keeping the difference in teachings a secret (confidentially))
Fujo-kyo (correct name is Kenro Fujo-kyo and it is the teachings which Shaka preached in order to give indefinite benefits separately (individually) to people whose patience is different while revealing the difference of the teachings)
These four correspond to Fivefold Periods as Ton-kyo to the Period of Kegon-kyo, Zen-kyo to three periods of Agon-kyo, Hodo-kyo and Hannya-kyo, Himitsu-kyo and Fujo-kyo to a part of Kegon and Agon, Hodo and Hannya and neither Ton-kyo, Zen-kyo, Himitsu-kyo nor Fujo-kyo correspond to the Period of Hoke-Nehan-kyo.
Keho-no-shikyo
Keho-no-shikyo is the categorization of Shaka's teachings based on their contents and such teachings (such as the Four Axioms, and so on) are called ho (teaching).
Zo-kyo (the abbreviated name of Sanzo-kyo (Tripitaka Teaching) that consists of kei (Sutta-pitaka), ron (Abhidhamma-pitaka) and ritsu (Vinaya-pitaka)).
It is also called Hinayana and it advocates the necessity of attaining enlightenment of Kuri (abstract or impracticable theory) in order to renounce worldly desires but as it regards every substance as a part of Ku (mind that is not bound by anything), it is called 'Tanku-no ri' (the theory of only Ku) or 'Henshin no Kuri' (the abstract or impracticable theory of prejudicial truth) because it is a prejudiced truth.
Tsu-kyo (teachings that are similar to Zo-kyo and Betsu-kyo.
It is a primer of Mahayana
It advocates Taikukan which regards the substances of various Ho as Ku, but while clever Bodhisattva attained 'Futanku-no-ri' which contains Chudo-no-myori (profound reasons of moderation) that is not mere Ku from it, stupid Bodhisattva, shomon (Sharavakia) and Engaku (or paccekabuddha, who has come to Bodhi independent of any other person) attained only 'Tanku' which could be attained from Zo-kyo).
Betsu-kyo (unlike Zo-kyo and Tsu-kyo above or En-kyo below, it is the teachings which Shaka separately preached to Bodhisattva only.
While the above two teachings advocate only Kuri, it advocates the three axioms of Ku, Ke (or difference, a though that things exits temporally) and Chu (or totality) but as the three axioms are not united and separated, it is called 'Kakureki-no-sandai' (three separate axioms) and it advocates only discrimination, rather than harmonization, concerning all things.
Although it also advocates the axiom of Chudo (moderation), it is called 'Tanchu-no-ri' (the theory of only Chudo) because what it advocates is mere Chudo that is separated from two axioms of Ku and Ke.
Further, it advocates the three delusions (illusions from imperfect perception, illusion and temptation through the immense variety of duties in saving men, illusions and temptations that arise from failure philosophically to understand things in their reality) and, to renounce them, it advocates the 52 steps of ascetic practices for Bodhisattva.
It further advocates karma of Jikkai (the Ten Realms) but only advocates the border of each realm separately.
In view of the above, Betsu-kyo is deemed an imperfect teaching since it lacks Sandai Enyu (The Perfectly Integrated Three Truths) and Jikkaigogu (Mutual Containment of the Ten Realms)).
En-kyo (the teachings of peace and harmonization.
It is the supreme teachings that advocate the harmonization of three axioms of Ku, Ke and Chu as well as Jikkaigogu).
These four teachings correspond to Fivefold Periods as Zo-kyo to Agon and Hodo, Tsu-kyo to Hodo and Hannya, Betsu-kyo to Kegon, Hodo and Hannya and En-kyo to Kegon, Hodo, Hannya and Hoke-Nehan respectively.
However, Kegon, Hodo, Hannya and Nehan-kyo are Zatsu-En (En-kyo that is mixed with other teachings) that is mixed with Hoben-kyo (tentative teachings that aim to induce people into real teachings) of Zo-kyo, Tsu-kyo and Betsu-kyo and therefore, they are not pure Enkyo.
Only Hoke-kyo is deemed as the one that advocates purely excellent En-kyo independently.
Therefore, Hoke-kyo is called the teachings of 'transcending eight - Daigo' because it transcends the eight teachings of Kegi (Shakamuni's four modes of instruction) and Keho (Shakamuni's four kinds of teaching the content of the Truth, accommodated to the capacity of his disciples).
Sanmon
Another name for the main gate of a Buddhist temple.
The word 'sanmon' (lit. mountain gate) is a remnant from the time when Buddhist temples were originally built on mountains, so that now even such gates of temples located on flatland are referred to as sanmon (please refer to 'Sanmon' and 'shichido garan.').
The term is also commonly used to refer to Buddhist temples in general.
This developed from the above usage (refer to 'Buddhist Temple').
Another name for Enryaku-ji Temple.
Onjo-ji Temple at the base of Mt. Hiei is referred to as the 'Jimon' whereas Enryaku-ji Temple located on Mt. Hiei is referred to as 'Sanmon' (please refer to 'Enryaku-ji Temple' and 'Mt. Hiei').
An abbreviation for the Sanmon School of the Tendai Sect headquartered at Mt. Hiei (refer to 'Tendai Sect').
The name ordinarily given to the 'Nanzenji Sanmon' scene of the second act of the kabuki play "Sanmon Gosan no Kiri" when performed independently (refer to 'Sanmon Gosan no Kiri').
Yamato
The name of a place that existed in Fukushima Prefecture prior to the great merger of municipalities in the Heisei era (refer to 'Yamato County').
Monkan (1278 - November 29, 1357) was a priest who lived from the Kamakura period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts.
Ono Sojo.
Shuon, Koshin.
He was the head priest of Daigo-ji Temple.
In 1302, he was a priest of the Risshu sect at Hannya-ji Temple and learned Shingonritsu at temples related to Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City) such as Hojo Joraku-ji Temple in Harima Province (Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture) and Kasayama Chikuzan-ji Temple in Yamato Province (Kasa, Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).
In 1316, he was given Kanjo (conferred the basic precepts and mystic teachings of esoteric Buddhism) by Dojun of Hoonin, Daigo-ji Temple.
He was also known as a priest of Tachikawa school (Mikkyo, Esoteric Buddhism), the Shingon sect, which was considered as a heretical religion, and he was a priest who renounced the world and relieved the poor with Enkan (Echin).
He was taken into confidence by Emperor Godaigo and assumed the role of the head priest of Daigo-ji Temple and Betto (the superior of a temple) of Tenno-ji Temple.
In 1324, he made the statue of Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri Bodhisattva associated with wisdom, doctrine and awareness) at Hannya-ji Temple and it was brought to light that he had implemented rituals to attempt to destroy the Kamakura Shogunate, by FUJIWARA no Kishi, chugu (the second consort of an emperor) of Godaigo from 1326, so he was arrested in 1331 and was sentenced to deportation to Io-jima Island (Kagoshima Prefecture).
When the Kamakura Shogunate was subverted after the Genko Incident in 1333, he went back to Kyoto, and he also moved to Yoshino in attendance of Godaigo and became Chief Abbot of To-ji Temple and daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order).
He died at Kongo-ji Temple on Mt. Amano in Kawachi Province (Kawachinagano City, Osaka Prefecture) at the age of 80.
He was also considered as having promoted Toshimoto HINO and to mediate between Masashige KUSUNOKI, who was known as Akuto (a villain in medieval times) in Kawachi, and Emperor Godaigo.
Myoha SHUNOKU (1311 - November 9, 1388) was a Zen priest of the Rinzai sect in the Muromachi period.
He was trusted by the Muromachi Shogunate and became the chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple and Rinsei-ji Temple.
Chikaku Fumyo Kokushi.
He was born in Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture).
He vowed to follow the precepts under Soseki MUSO, his maternal uncle.
He became the chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple and advised the Shogunate to build Romon (Sanmon, temple gate) of Nanzen-ji Temple, the first temple of gozan (Zen temples highly ranked by the government), which the Shogunate sponsored.
Together with the Monto (followers) of Mt. Hiei, Onjo-ji Temple, which was in conflict with Nanzen-ji Temple, protested against the construction of the Romon, requesting its removal and Myoha's banishment, and this resulted in the conflict becoming a political issue.
In 1369, Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA, who held the position of kanrei (shogunal deputy), ordered the removal of Romon.
Myoha, who opposed Yoriyuki, resigned as the chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple and retired at Shokoin Temple and later at Unmon-ji Temple in Tango Province.
Yoriyuki asked Myoha to see him for reconciliation, but Myoha rejected this, and Yoriyuki stripped Monto of the title of priest.
Myoha went back to Kyoto after Yoriyuki fell from power in the Koryaku Coup in 1379, and returned to be the chief priest of Nanzen-ji Temple.
Since Myoha had left Tango before Yoriyuki fell from power, he may have been involved in this political change.
He was trusted by the third Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and became the first Soroku (highest-ranking priest of the Gozan, the leader of the Zen sect) on November 27, 1379.
He founded Shokoku-ji Temple and established Gozanha (group of the highest-ranked temples in Zen sect).
He published books called Gozanban (literally, Five Mountains Editions).
In addition, he fostered many disciples, who played roles as diplomatic counselors in the trade between the Ming Dynasty and Japan.
"Shunoku Myoha Chinzo" (Portrait of Myoha SHUOKU) was written by Mincho KICHIZAN and is in the possession of Kogenin Temple.
Segaki is a title of a Buddhist mass.
Or it is called Segaki-e.
As it can be read as 'feeding hungry ghosts' in the kun-doku (the word-for-word translating method from Chinese to Japanese), it means the rites to feed living things who fell into Gaki-do (world of hungry ghosts) specially after their death among Bonpu (unenlightened persons) in the worlds of Rokudo rinne (Rebirth in the Six Worlds) and holding a mass for their spirits.
This Buddhist mass is usually held on July 15 (old lunar calendar) as Urabon festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Soul's Day, around the 15th of July or August, depending on local customs).
In the case of the Obon festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Soul's Day) in Japan, each ancestor's spirit called Oshorai-sama is considered to come back to the Buddhist altar in each house once a year so that people place Bonku (offerings) during the Obon period.
At the same time, there is a custom to place segakidana (rack for carrying the dead), gakidana (shelf for holding a deceased person) or Shoryoma (conveyance for the spirits of the deceased) for hungry ghosts who are wandering in this world as muen botoke (a person who died leaving nobody to look after his (her) grave).
However, Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) does not hold Segaki-e.
In the Soto sect, it is commonly called Urabon-e Segaki, but the title of 'Segaki-e' was changed to 'Sejiki-e' because the high or the low and lord or loon should not be distinguished between the people who feed and those who are fed.
In addition, Segaki is usually held during the period of Urabon, but fundamentally it should not be held only at a specific time (that is, Urabon).
It is said that this has been commonly misconceived because the legends of the honorable priests of Mokuren and Anan (Ananda) were similar (as following).
It is said that Segeki of Mokuren originated from 'Urabon-e-kyo Sutra.'
According to this sutra, when the honorable priest Mokuren, who was one of the Judai deshi (The Ten Chief Disciples of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni) and called the top of divine power, looked for the whereabouts of his late mother, she became skin and bones in Gaki-do and was going through hell.
Mokuren tried to feed his mother by his divine power, but she could neither eat nor drink because not only food but also water were burned out.
Mokuren asked Shaka (Sakyamuni) how to relieve her.
Then, Shaka said to him, 'Your mother is highly guilty. She has not done any favors to others and has been so selfish that she fell into Gaki-do.' and 'Prepare something special and recite sutra on July 15 after many priests finish the 90 days ascetic trainings of rainy season, and pray for her from the heart.'
As soon as Mokuren had done this, immediately, Mokuren's mother was relieved from the suffering of hunger.
This is considered to be the origin of Urabon (However, it is influential that this sutra is a false sutra created later in China).
On the other hand, Segaki of Anan originates from 'Kubatsu Enku Darani-kyo Sutra' (Dharani for Extinguishing the Flaming Preta's Mouths).
When the honorable priest Anan, who was one of the Judai deshi and was called the top ability of Tamon (to hear lots of sutras and to keep good behavior), was practicing meditation at a quite place, a hungry ghost named Enku appeared.
He was an ugly hungry ghost who fell away to a shadow and caught fire from the mouth with thin throat, wild hair and shining eyes.
The hungry ghost said to Anan, 'You will die after three days and undergo rebirth as an ugly hungry ghost like me.'
Anan was surprised at that and asked the ghost to avoid such troubles.
It said, 'If you feed all suffering living things in Gaki-do and hold a mass for the 3 treasures of Buddhism: Buddha, sutras and the priesthood, you will take a fresh lease of life and we will escape from suffering as well.'
However, Anan did not have enough money for that, so that he asked Sakyamuni Buddha for help.
Then, Sakyamuni Buddha said, 'There is a secret spell of Kanzeon Bosatsu (the Goddess of Mercy). If you serve food on a dish and perform Kaji (incantation) by reciting this "Kajionjiki Dharani" (literally, incantation for food and drink), the food will become an immeasurable amount of food for all hungry ghosts to feel full enough, and immeasurable sufferings will be relieved, and you can live longer and get a certificate of Buddhism by that good deed.'
As soon as Anan had done this, immediately, he could take a fresh lease of life and was relieved.
This is said to be the origin of Segaki.
It is said that these two legends were confused and many temples came to hold Segaki during the period of Urabon.
Shingon Risshu sect is one sect which practices the commandments of Vajrayana based on the dharma of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism.
It also has the significance of renaissance of the Risshu sect's sprit, which is one of the Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara).
Founder of the Sect
Kosei Bosatsu Eison of Saidai-ji Temple in Nara City was the restorer.
In addition, it especially regards Kukai as Koso (a founder).
Eison implemented Jukai (handing down the precepts), a procedure which was limited to what had been defined by the state, by himself with Kakujo in the Risshu sect because he criticized the degraded existing Buddhism (vow by oneself and Jukai).
After that he made a clear distinction from Kakujo because of differences in the idea of commandments, but he accepted Kakujo's request to restore Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City), engaged in the restoration of temples such as Hokke-ji Temple and Hannya-ji Temple subsequently, and an placed independent Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) without the permission of the Imperial Court.
Continuously, his disciple Ninsho appeared and built Gokuraku-ji Temple in Kamakura City, showing the wit of propagandism against the people, which Eison could not have achieved fully.
This is the origin of the Shingon Risshu sect, but at that time Eison himself and his disciples tried to restore the Risshu sect as a part of renaissance of the Shingon sect and they identified themselves as the 'Saidai-ji Temple school,' one school of the Shingon sect.
However, at that time it was considered as a new school of the Risshu sect.
Besides, although Eison's activities are generally seen as a reform movement inside old Buddhism, recently there is a theory that it was a new sect beyond the frames of the Shingon sect and the Risshu sect and one of the new Kamakura Buddhism (See the article of Kamakura Buddhism).
His successor Shinku (Shingon Risshu sect) and Ninsho gained the confidence of the Imperial Court and made efforts to broaden the influence of the sect as they made provincial monasteries branch temples for restoration (temple solicitation) by Imperial order.
Activities for temple solicitation led by priests of the Shingon Risshu sect were well recognized because they were strict by themselves and had know-how of temple restoration, which soon promoted the movement of renaissance of other Risshu sects so much so that the Risshu sect, including the Shingon Risshu sect, was criticized by Nichiren as 'Ritsu traitor to the country,' having the same power of influence as the Zen sect and the Jodo sect.
Although it declined temporarily after in the latter part of the Muromachi period, Myonin tried to restore it during the early part of the Edo period and his disciple Jogon used the title of 'Shingon Risshu sect' formally for the first time.
When the Meiji Government organized various sects in 1872, all Risshu sects were incorporated into the Shingon sect because Shingon Risshu sect which was the biggest sect among Risshu sects at that time, originated from the Shingon sect.
After that, schools of the Risshu sect requested independence from the Shingon sect, for example Kocho SAEKI (Hirosumi SAEKI) (the 64th choro (patriarch)) of Saidai-ji Temple carried on a campaign.
Rewarding this movement, schools of the Risshu sect were permitted to become independent from the Shingon sect in 1895, and the Shingon Risshu sect also gained independence from the Shingon sect at that time.
However, some temples which had been Shingon Risshu sect temples before the Meiji period remained as Shingon sect temples without following the independent movement.
After that, the choro of Saidai-ji Temple who is the head priest of Saidai-ji Temple as sohonzan (the general head temple) doubled as the chief abbot of the Shingon Risshu sect as a custom.
Sohonzan: Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City)
Daihonzan (the major head temples): Hozan-ji Temple (Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture)

Shoku (or Nishiyama, 1177 - December 31, 1247) was the founder of the Seizan Jodo sect, Seizan Zenrin-ji School of the Jodo sect and Seizan Fukakusa School of the Jodo sect.
He was a leading disciple of Honen and initially named himself as Gedatsu-bo and later on as Zenne-bo.
Shigo (posthumous name) was Miten or Ganchi kokushi.
He was born eldest son of MINAMOTO no Chikasue, Kaga no Gon no kami (Provisional Governor of Kaga Province), and adopted by Michichika KOGA of naidaijin (Minister of the Interior), who belonged to the Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan), when he was nine years old.
In 1190, when he celebrated his coming of age at 14, he became a monk as a disciple of Honen.
Since then, he studied the secrets of Jodo-kyo (pure land teachings).
He studied under Honen for 21 years until the demise of Honen.
He was known as a bright person who could understand everything once he saw or heard it, and in 1198 he played an important role in checking citations, called Kanmon, in compiling Honen's "Senchaku Hongan Nenbutsu-shu" (the holy writings of the Jodo Sect) and in the following year, he gave a lecture on "Senchaku-shu" at Kanezane KUJO's residence in place of Honen.
In 1204 when Honen submitted "shichikajo kishomon" (Seven Article Pledge) to Shinsho, Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect) and daisojo (high priest), Shoku signed the fourth, and this fact gives evidence of his important position among peer disciples.
After studying under Honen for 23 years, he attained the in-depth doctrine of Jodo-kyo and inherited Endon Bosatsu-kai Bodhisattva Precepts.
From that time, he started studying, by exhortation of Honen, Tendai Learning under Ganren of Hino as well as Daimitsu (esoteric Buddhism of the Japanese Tendai Sect) under Seishun.
When Honen passed away in 1212, he moved from Higashiyama Kosaka to Kitao Ojoin (Sango-ji Temple) of Seizan Yoshimine-dera Temple, which he inherited from Jien, the Tendai-zasu and the daisojo.
From 1215, four years after the demise of Honen, until 1227, just before the Karoku Persecution, he shuttled almost everyday between Ojoin Temple, which was his base, and over 30 places around Kyoto and gave lectures on Shandao's literary works including "Kangyosho" (Commentary on the Meditation Sutra).
The record of the above lectures were compiled as "Kanmon Yogi Sho" in 41 volumes and still exist.
In the Karoku Persecution in 1227, he was exempted from exile along with Shinku (Jodo sect) who was also the leading disciple of Honen.
When he made a pilgrimage to Nara Taima-dera Temple in 1229, he had the honor of seeing "Kangyo mandala" (the picture describing Buddhist Heaven and Pure Land of the Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life)) and since that time, he strived for its circulation.
On February 28, 1243 at Kyoto Nishiyama, he, together with disciples, transcribed including Sanbu-kyo Sutra (three main sutras) to hold a mass and put them in the inner hollow of the statue of Raigobutsu (Amida Buddha coming to welcome the spirits of the dead) (texts found in the inner hollow of the Raigobutsu statue at Yamazaki Dainen-ji Temple).
In the same year, he constructed Kangishinin Temple by the order of Emperor Gosaga and he often went to the Imperial Palace, gave lectures on Seizan-gi (or Kosaka-gi, the teachings of the Seizan school) and bestowed Bodhisattva Precepts.
In 1247, he wrote "Chinkanyojin" (a collection of Shoku's sermon) for Cloistered Imperial Prince Dokaku and "Nyoingosho," which was a Buddhist sermon in Japanese writing, for the empress dowager.
Knowing that his days were numbered, he gave a lecture to his disciples on the crucial points of Bosatsu-kai and "Kanmuryoju-kyo" on December 27, 1247, conducted Tendai-daishi ko (a Buddhist memorial ceremony for Tendai-daishi (or Chigi)) on December 29, gave a lecture on the core points of "Bosatsu-kai Gisho" (Commentary on the Doctrine of the Bodhisattva Precepts) for Myokan of Senyu-ji Temple on the following day, and passed away at the age of 71 on December 31 at Shirakawa Kengoin Temple while dressed in a Daie (or Kujogesa, a robe worn by Buddhist priests) after chanting "Amida Sutra" and putting the palms of his hands together as he performed nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation).
Disciples entombed his body at Seizan Sanko-ji Temple and constructed the pagoda named Kadai-byo.
In 1796, he was bestowed Shigo of Ganchi kokushi by Emperor Kokaku.
Major temples constructed by Shoku are Seizan Ojoin Temple, Kangishinin Temple, Jokyoji Temple and Kengoin Temple, and so on.
Shoku's portrait, known as 'Image of the thinker,' suggests that his Jodo-kyo teaching was quite philosophical.
His literary works are basically divided into two categories; practical parts and theoretical parts.
The former includes "Kanmon Yogi Sho" of 41 volumes, "Kangyosho Tahitsusho" (the records of Shoku's lecture about "Kanmuryoju-kyosho" (the records of Shoku's lecture about Kanmuryoju-kyosho (or Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra) written by Kankyo) of 14 volumes, "Kangyosho Taii" (overview of Kanmuryoju-kyosho (or Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra)) of 1 volume, "Kanmon-gi Soan" (draft about the teachings of Kanmon (contemplating dharmas as void)) of 2 volumes, "Sanbu-kyo Rongiki" (summary of debating about Sanbu-kyo (three main sutras)) of 1 volume, "Sanengi" (teachings about sanen (the Three Types of Karmic Relation with Amida Buddha)) of 1 volume, "Josanryoken-gi" (literally, teachings about the mind in one's concentration and non-concentration) of 1 volume, "Godansho" (Buddhist scriptures about tariki nenbutsu (the spirituality of the other power of Buddhist invocation)) of 1 volume, "Anjinsho Furyaku Anjinsho" (literally, the scripture and the summary about obtaining peace of mind through faith or ascetic practice), "Zenne Shonin Gohogo" (the Buddhist sermon of Zenne Shonin (or Shoku)) of 1 volume, "Shiraki Nenbutsu Hogo" (the Buddhist sermon of Shiraki Nenbutsu (tariki nenbutsu (the spirituality of the other power of Buddhist invocation)) without distraction) of 1 volume, "Jutsujo" (records of dialogue between Shoku and Rensho) of 1 volume, "Chinkanyojin" of 1 volume and "Nyoingosho" of 2 volumes, and so on.
The latter includes "Taima Mandara Chuki" (annotation about Taima Mandala) of 10 volumes, "Kangyo Hiketsu-Shu" (The key points of the Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) of 20 volumes, "Senchaku Mitsu Yoketsu" Senchaku Mitsu Yoketsu (literally, Buddhist scriptures about selecting Buddhism) of 5 volumes, "Shujuhachi-gan Yoshakusho" (literally, commentary about Forty-eight Vows) of 2 volumes, "Shugo Yoketsu" (Buddhist scriptures about ascetic practices) of 1 volume, "Taima Mandara Kushiki" (the method to serve Taima Mandala) of 1 volume and "Taima Mandara Hakko Rongisho" (eight lectures of Taima Mandala) of 1 volume, and so on.
Concerning these literary works included in the category of the theoretical parts, there are two contradictory views on their authenticity.
He had many disciples and among them, Joon, Ryushin, Shonyu and Shoe were collectively called the four schools of Nishiyama because each of them founded their own schools.
Other than the above, Rensho (UTSUNOMIYA Jisshin-bo) was said to have constantly followed Shoku and he compiled his mentor's lectures in "Sekigakubosho" in 2 volumes.
Waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables)
With the awakening to great mercy that embraces me everyday despite my worldly desires, I will powerfully live in the present while thanking for it and repaying the indefinite debt to great mercy.
Mappo-shiso is a kind of Buddhist prediction philosophy under three periods which the period of 1,000 years (also said to be 500 years) after the establishment of Buddhism by Shaka is called Shobo, and the following period of 1,000 years is called Zobo and the following period of 10,000 years is called Mappo and these three periods are considered as different.
It is a view of history on the decline of Buddhism (especially Mahayana Buddhism) and according to it, Buddhism would not be practiced correctly in Mappo since Shaka's teaching would have lost influence.
As the expression of 'it is the end of the world' is said to have been derived from Mappo shiso, sometimes this is understood as equivalent to eschatology but such understanding is wrong (to be mentioned below).
As there are various views on the date of Shaka's death, the period of Mappo is not defined clearly.
Since the medieval age, Mappo shiso has often been understood in Japan as similar to eschatology, which means the end of the world.
However, Mappo shiso solely points to the decline of Buddhism, namely it is the prediction that Buddhism would lose its influence over time and it does not relate to social unrest and natural catastrophe.
Therefore, Mappo shiso does not mean 'the end of the world.'
Although some sutras assert that the decline of Buddhism is accompanied by social unrest and natural catastrophe, such as "Hometsujin-kyo Sutra" (Decline of the Law Sutra), it is generally believed that these are bogus sutras that were created in the later stages of history.
Mahayana Buddhism advocates 'no increase, no decrease' and 'no beginning, no end' as the development of Kuron (theory of Ku (mind that is not bound by anything)).
Further, "Nehan-gyo Sutra" (the Nirvana Sutra) fundamentally denies the pessimistic view on Mappo by advocating that Buddha will reappear in this world in the Mappo period when Buddhism has declined.
Therefore, Mappo shiso is not equivalent to eschatology.
The source of Mappo shiso is the description of "Daijkkyo Sutra" (officially, "Daihododaijikkyo Sutra" (Mahsamnipata sutra)) saying, 'Gedatsu Kengo (Age of enlightenment) will remain solid for 500 years after my death, Zenjo kengo (the age of meditation) will remain solid for the following 500 years, Dokuju tamon kengo (the age of reading, reciting, and listening) will remain solid for the following 500 years, Tazo toji kengo (the age of building temples and stupas) will remain solid for the following 500 years and in the following 500 years, there will be disputes concerning my teaching and correct teaching will be forgotten.'
In essence, there will be disputes among Buddhists and correct teaching will be forgotten in the period of the final 500 years.
In China, Mappo shiso became prevalent during the era of the Sui and Tang Dynasties and it is closely related to the establishment of Sangai-kyo (Three Stages Sect) or Jodo-kyo (Jodo (Pure Land) sect).
Its early example is seen in 'Ryusei Ganmon' which was written by Eshi, the second founder of the Tendai sect, during the period of Northern Ch'i and Chen (southern dynasty) and the Stone Sutra Project at Fangshan, which had been continuing for over 1,000 years since the period of the Sui dynasty, was also based on Mappo shiso.
In Japan, it became a reality in the Heian period.
Especially, the year of 1052 was deemed as the first year of Mappo and many sutra mounds were built since people were scared.
In this period, the warrior class was increasing its power while regency of nobility was declining and people's anxiety was growing due to the unstable and dangerous society.
Buddhism society also deteriorated due to corruption at many temples, including the Tendai sect, and the emergence of priest soldiers.
As the Buddhist prediction of Mappo coincided with the real social situation, people's anxiety for real society deepened and they became addicted to pessimistic philosophy in order to escape from such anxiety.
In the Kamakura period, Honen of the Jodo sect and Shinran of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) called for, based on Mappo shiso, repeating the name of Buddha in order to be able to go to Amidanyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) at Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (The West Pure Land (of Amida Buddha)) after death.
Nichiren also called for hokke-ichijo (the doctrines called the Single Vehicle of the Lotus) in the same period.
However, Dogen, the founder of the Soto sect, denied Mappo shiso asserting that there were some dull disciples who committed evil deeds while Shaka was in life and people might use Mappo as an excuse for not doing ascetic training.
Ryokai-mandala is a mandala which visually depicts the truth and the state of enlightenment that is advocated by Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana), principal Buddha in Esoteric Buddhism.
Mandala is the one where many 'Buddha,' including Dainichi Nyorai, are arranged in accordance with a certain fixed order and two mandala, namely Garbha-mandala (also called Taizokai-mandala) and Vajradhatu-mandala, are collectively called Ryokai-mandala or Ryoubu mandala.
Other than the ones which depict the individual image of Buddha in paintings, some depict one Buddha symbolically by one Sanskrit character (a kind of letter which was used for writing Sanskrit).
Garbha-mandala (Daihitaizosho mandala) is drawn based on Esoteric Buddhism scriptures called 'Daibirushana Jobutsu Jinbenkaji-kyo Sutra' (Mahavairocana Sutra) and Vajradhatumandala is drawn based on Esoteric Buddhism scriptures called 'Kongocho-kyo' (Vajrasekhara Sutra).
Dainichi-kyo Sutra (Mahavairocana Sutra) is believed to have been established in India in the middle of the 7th century and it was translated into Kanji characters (translated into the then Chinese language) around 725 in the early 8th century by Zenmui (683 - 735), a native Indian monk, along with his disciple Ichigyo (683 - 727).
On the other hand, Kongocho-kyo Sutra is believed to have been established in India during the period from the end of 7th century to early 8th century and was translated into Kanji characters around the same time with the translation of Dainichi-kyo Sutra by Kongochi (671 - 741), a native Indian monk, along with his disciple Fuku (705 - 774).
Although the volume of Kongocho-kyo Sutra is so huge since it compiled all the teachings that Dainichi Nyorai advocated on 18 various occasions, collectively called Jyuhachi-e, the one which Kongochi and Fuku translated is the teachings advocated on the first occasion, called Sho-e, only.
The teachings at Sho-e are called Shinjitu Sho-gyo Sutra (attva-samgraha).
At any rate, despite the fact that both 'Dainichi-kyo Sutra' and 'Kongocho-kyo Sutra' share Dainichi Nyorai as their common principal Buddha, these two are scriptures of different lineage which were established independently in different regions of India at different times and were introduced into China separately.
It is presumed that Eka (746 - 805), a monk in the Tang dynasty period and who was Kukai's mentor, integrated the teachings of two scriptures into Ryokai-mandala.
As Eka thought it impossible to orally transmit the in-depth teachings of Esoteric Buddhism, he made a Tang painter draw Ryokai-mandala and gave it to Kukai.
Kukai took back such mandala when he returned to Japan in 806 after finishing his study in Tang.
Although the originals which Kukai took back were lost, a copy which is believed to be quite similar to the original is preserved at Jingo-ji Temple in Kyoto, known as national treasury Ryokai-mandala (commonly called Takao-mandala).
Mandala at Jingo-ji Temple is not a colored one but one drawn with ground gold and silver on a woven purple material.
Garbha-mandala is called Daihitaizosho mandala to be precise and although the term that indicates 'world' is not included in the original language, it has been called 'Taizokai mandala' from long ago in tune with Vajradhatumandala,.
The mandala is divided into 12 parts of 'in' (sections).
What is located in the center is 'the central eight-Petal Court' and Taizokai Dainichi Nyorai (who is in a posture of 'Hokkai Join' (Dharma-realm meditation mudra) folding both hands in front of the belly) is sitting on the center of a lotus flower with 8 petals.
Around Dainichi Nyorai, all 8 statues, namely 4 of Nyorai (Hodo (Ratnaketu Tathagata), Kaifukeo (Samkusumitaraja), Amida Nyorai (or Muryoju, Amitabha Tathagata) and Tenkuraion (Divyadundubhimeghanirghosa)) and 4 of Bosatsu (Fugen bosatsu (Samantabhadra Bodhisattva), Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri), Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Buddhisattva) and Miroku Bosatsu (Buddha of the Future, Bodhisattva of the Present), are depicted.
As for the naming of mandala, both Taizokai-mandala and Garbha-mandala are used in Japan but Motohiro YORITOMI, a researcher of Esoteric Buddhism, wrote in his book titled "Architectures of mandala-centering on mandala at To-ji Temple" as 'the name of mandala were created in consideration of both Dainichi-kyo Sutra and Kongocho-kyo Sutra, collectively called Ryobu Sutra and both are the source of mandala, and Kukai used only this name (note: Ryobu-mandala),' 'because Kongocho-kyo Sutra clearly uses Vajradhatumandala, Dainichi-kyo Sutra does not use the name of Taizokai-mandala though it uses Daihitaizosho mandala or Garbha-mandala.'
Motohiro YORITOMI further asserts that with the development of Tendai Esoteric Buddhism (Daimitsu) thanks to Ennin, Enchin and Annen, the term of 'Taizokai' (the Womb Realm) was widely used in the text for prayer and austerities and as a result, the terms of Ryokai-mandala and Taizokai-mandala came into use.
The central eight-Petal Court is surrounded by Henchi-in, Jimyo-in, Shaka-in (Court of Shaka Nyorai), Kokuzo-in (Court of Kokuzo Bosatsu (Akasagarbha Bodhisattva), Monju-in (Court of Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri)), Soshituji-in, Rengebu-in, Jizo-in (Court of Jizo Bosatsu (Jizo Bodhisattva)), Kongoshu-in and Jogaisho-in in a concentric fashion and Gekongobu-in, also called Saige-in, is located at the outer circumference that encircles all of the above.
This suggests the movement from the inner side to the outer side and represents the transformation of Dainichi Nyorai's abstract wisdom into practice in the real world.
Further, Garbha-mandala should be seen by dividing it into three blocks, namely center, right and left block.
The center block represents the world of Dainichi Nyorai's state of enlightment while Rengebu-in (Kannon-in), whose principal statue is Shokanjizai Bosatsu (Kannon Bosatsu), is located on the observers' left (south in terms of direction) and Kongoshu-in (Kongobu-in or Satta-in), whose principal statue is Kongosatta, is located on the observers' right (north in terms of direction).
It is believed that Rengebu-in represents Nyorai's 'mercy' and Kongoshu-in represents Nyorai's 'wisdom' respectively.
While each block of Garbha-mandala is called 'in,' the term of 'E' is used in the case of Vajradhatu-mandala and it consists of Ku-e (nine e), namely Jojin-e, Samaya-e, Misai-e, Kuyo-e, Shiin-e, Ichiin-e, Rishu-e, Gozanze-e and Gozanze Samaya-e.
This should be understood as the aggregate of 9 mandala rather than 9 blocks.
The principal statue of Jojin-e, which is located in the center, is Kongokai Danichi Nyorai (who is in a posture of 'Chiken-in' (the knowledge-fist mudra) with wrapping the forefinger of left hand by the fist of right hand).
Ashuku Nyorai, Hosho Nyorai (Ratnasambhava, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas), Amida Nyorai and Fukujoju Nyorai (Amoghasiddhi, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas) are located at the east, south, west and north of Dainichi Nyorai respectively (Dainichi, Ashuku, Hosho, Amida and Fukujoju are collectively called Kongokai-gobutsu or Gochi-nyorai).
At the east, south, west and north side of each Nyorai, Bosatsu that are closely related to each Nyorai, called Shishingon Bosatsu (Four Attendant Bodhisattva), are located.
Samaya-e, Misai-e and Kuyo-e have almost the same composition as that of Jojin-e located in the center and it is no mistake that Shiin-e is the simplified version of the above and Ichiin-e is the one which omits other Buddha than Dainichi Nyorai.
The principal statues of Rishu-e, Gozanze-e and Gozanze Samaya-e, which are located at the right side of mandala, are not Dainichi Nyorai but Kongosatta for Rishu-e and Gozanze Myoo (Trailokya-vijaya) for the other two.
Kongosatta, who is counted as one of the Bosatsu, and Gozanze Myoo, who has a fierce look, are believed to be the reincarnation of Dainichi Nyorai after attaining the state of enlightment and this depiction represents the belief that everything derives solely from Dainichi Nyorai.
It is perceived that while Garbha-mandala grasps the truth as matter of the real world from practical aspects, Vajradhatu-mandala grasps the truth as the matter of spiritual world from theoretical aspects.
Godai Bosatsu are a kind of combination of Bosatsu (those who are engaged in ascetic training in pursuit of the truth and enlightment) that are objects of worship and construction of statues in Buddhist society.
This is the combination of principal Bosatsu, picked up from many Bosatsu depicted in Ryokai-mandala (Vajradhatumandala), which is valued by Esoteric Buddhism, but there is no prominent work other than the statues at To-ji Temple in Kyoto City, as mentioned below.
In the Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple) in Kyoto, there is a three dimensional Mandala, which consists of 21 statues, that was made by the initiative of Kukai.
Those statues enshrined at the Lecture Hall are categorized into the Nyorai (Tathagata) group, the Myoo (vidya-raja) group and the Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) group respectively.
Kongokai-gobutsu (Gochi Nyorai (Five Wisdom Nyorai, Tathagatas)), of which the principal statue is Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana), is enshrined at the center of the Hall, Godai Myoo (Five Great Myoo), of which the principal statue is Fudo Myoo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings), is enshrined on the observers' left (west) and Godai Bosatsu is enshrined on the observers' right respectively.
Godai Bosatsu enshrined at the Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple consist of 5 Bosatsu statues, namely Kongouharamitsu (Vajraparamita), Kongosatta (Vajrapani, the Diamond Being), Kongoho Bosatsu (Vajraratna Bodhisattava), Kongoho Bosatsu (Vajragarbha Bodhisattava) and Kongogo Bosatsu (Vajrakarma Bodhisattava).
Many Gobutsu (Gochi-nyorai) and Godai Myoo are seen throughout Japan but Godai Bosatsu which combine Kongouharamitsu, Kongosatta, Kongoho Bosatsu, Kongoho Bosatsu and Kongogo Bosatsu are only rarely enshrined at temples other than To-ji Temple and its authority is also unknown.
It is commonly believed that Kukai created Godai Bosatsu by himself based on Kongocho-kyo Sutra (or Vajrasekhara Sutra, one of the basic sutra of Esoteric Buddhism) and Nio-kyo Sutra (or the Sutra of Benevolent Kings, a sutra that advocates guarding the nation by Buddhism), but there is also a view that it is traceable to Esoteric Buddhist art during the period of the Tang Dynasty in China.
Among Godai Bosatsu at To-ji Temple, Kongoharamitsu is the head Bosatsu of 'Shiharamitsu' (four paramita) placed at the east, west, south and north of Dainichinyorai in Vajradhatu Mandala.
According to Vajradhatu Mandala, Kongosatta is the head of the Shishingon Bosatsu placed around Ashuku-nyorai at the east and similarly Kongoho Bosatsu, Kongoho Bosatsu and Kongogyo Bosatsu are the heads of Shishingon Bosatsu (Four Attendant Bodhisattva) placed around Hosho Nyorai (Ratnasambhava) at the south, Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) at the west and Fukujoju N-nyorai (Amoghasiddhi) at the north, respectively.
From the above, it is obvious that each of the Godai Bosatsu corresponds to one of the Gobutsu.
The Sanrinshin (the three wheel-embodiments) theory of Esoteric Buddhism advocates that 'Buddha' has three figures called Jishorinjin (embodiment of the wheel of own-nature), Shoborinjin (embodiment of the wheel of the true Dhara) and Kyoryorinjin (embodiment of the wheel of injunction).
According to this theory, Jishorinjin represents the truth and the state of enlightment itself and corresponds to Gobutsu, Shoborinjin represents the one preaching the truth and corresponds to Godai Bosatsu and Kyoryorinjin represents the one forcibly guiding people who cannot be educated by preaching and corresponds to Godai Myoo, respectively.
Statues enshrined at the Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple make up a three dimensional mandala that represents such Esoteric Buddhist philosophy in the form of three dimensional sculptures.
Tenbu (deva in Sanskrit) means deities of Buddhism.
The origin of most of them are deities of Brahmanism in ancient India and later on, they were introduced in Buddhism and became Goho Zenshin (good deities protecting dharma), guardian deities of Buddhism.
Ten (deity of heavenly realm), Tenbu-shin (Tenbu deity).
While Tenbu is sometimes simply referred to as Ten, the world where Tenbu resides in is also translated as Ten (Buddhism) (devaloka) and these two are often confused in Chinese character using regions.
Although the term of deva in Sanskrit means 'deity,' it was translated as 'Ten' in China and the Japanese language followed such translation.
The Chinese character of 'Bu,' which makes up the term of 'Tenbu' together with the Chinese character of 'Ten,' doesn't have a significant meaning other than 'division' or 'group.'
Therefore, simply referring to as 'Ten' ought to be enough for understanding but in Japanese, the term 'Tenbu zo' (image of Tenbu) has been traditionally used instead of 'Ten zo' (image of Ten).
The term of deva is also translated as Tenjin (heavenly deities) or Tennin (heavenly beings), but in this case, the shades of meaning are different to a certain extent.
Brahmanism deities in ancient India, the roots of deities of Tenbu, include a wide variety of deities ranging from the deity of universe creation to those of evil spirits or demons.
These deities have various appearances and nature including male deities (Bishamonten (Vaisravana), Daikokuten (Mahakala), and so on), female deities (Kisshoten (Laksmi), Benzaiten (Sarasvati, Buddhist goddess of music, learning, eloquence, wealth, longevity, and protection from natural disasters), and so on), type of kishin (nobles) (Bonten (Brahma, a major Hindu deity thought to be responsible for creating the world)), type of tennyo (a heavenly maiden) (Kisshoten), type of rikishi (strong men) Kongo Rikishi (protector deities) and type of busho (Japanese military commander) (Juni Shinsho (the twelve protective deities)), and so on.
Buddha' in broad terms that are the target of worshipping and making sculptures in Buddhism are generally categorized into four groups, namely 'Nyorai-bu' (group of Tathagata), 'Bosatsu-bu' (group of Bodhisattva), 'Myoo-bu' (group of Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) and 'Tenbu' (group of protesters of Buddhist laws).
Nyorai' is equivalent to 'Buddha' and means 'those who have attained enlightment,' 'Bosatsu' means those who are engaged in ascetic training in pursuit of attaining enlightment and under Exoteric Buddhism, Myoo-bu is not included basically because it holds Jikkai (the Ten Realms) theory.
On the other hand, Esoteric Buddhism holds Sanrinshin (the three wheel-embodiments) theory which asserts that Buddha has three figures of Jishorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of own-nature), Shoborinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of the true Dhara) and Kyoryorinjin (the embodiment of the wheel of injunction) and according to this theory, 'Myoo' is considered as Kyoryorinjin, the incarnation of Nyorai, that forcibly guides people who cannot be educated by preaching only.
Therefore, many Myoo sculptures have fierce facial expressions called hunnu.
In contrast with deities belonging to the above three groups, those belonging to 'Tenbu' carry the connotation of a guardian deity of Buddhism or a deity of fortune and many of them are the target of worship seeking worldly divine help.
Deities Belonging to Tenbu
Principal deities belonging to Tenbu are Bonten, Taishakuten (Sakra devanam Indra), Shitenno (four guardian kings) that consists of Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra), Zochoten (Virudhaka), Komokuten (Virupaksa) and Tamonten (Vaisravana) (Bishamonten (Vaisravana)), Benzaiten, Daikokuten (Mahakala), Kisshoten, Idaten (Kitchen God, Protector of Monasteries & Monks) Marishiten (Goddess of Wealth & Warrior Class), Kangiten (Nandikesvara, Ganesh in the Buddhist pantheon), Kongorikishi, Kishimo-jin (Goddess of Children) (Kariteimo), Junishinsho, Juniten (twelve deities), Hachi Bushu (or Eight Legions, Protectors of Buddhist Teachings) and Nijuhachi Bushu (The twenty-eight attendants of Senju Kannon), and so on.
Shitenno, Hachi Bushu, Juniten, Junishinsho and Nijuhachi Bushu are known as the group of deities that aim to enhance the power of protecting Buddhism as guardian deities by gathering several deities.
These deities are enshrined in various places, for example at both sides of a temple's entrance gate, nearby Honzon (principal image of Buddha) or around Butsudan (Buddhist altar) but in the case of Bishamonten and Benzaiten, they are often enshrined as Honzon and are the target of worship.
Mandala (Sanskrit: mandala) means works that express sanctuary, Buddhahood and/or the world view of Buddhism visually and symbolically by means of statutes of Buddha, symbols and characters (especially those of Esoteric Buddhism).
Chinese character of 曼陀羅 is also used instead of 曼荼羅 (mandala).
Mandala originated in ancient India and was introduced into central Asia, China, Korean Peninsula and Japan.
In the 21st century, a lot of mandala works are being produced in Tibet and Japan, and so on.
The uniform name of mandala works designated as important cultural properties is '曼荼羅' in Japan, the word of '曼荼羅' is to be used in this column.
曼荼羅' or '曼陀羅' expresses the Sanskrit pronunciation of मण्डल in Chinese characters and these Chinese Characters themselves have no particular meaning, and ('荼' (da) is a different Chinese character from '茶' (cha)).
The meaning of मण्डल is usually explained as follows.
As मण्ड (maṇḍa) means 'real nature, quintessence or essence' and ल (la) means 'have' respectively, मण्डल means 'something that has the essence.'
On the other hand, since मण्डल has the adjective meaning of 'round' and the Chinese character 円 that means round has also the meaning of perfectness and peacefulness, some people assert that this is the word origin of mandala and in China, mandala is sometimes called 円満具足 (peacefulness and content).
When inviting deities, people in ancient India painted round or square magic squares and mandala with colored sand on a dirt mound, and exercised secret arts.
Although old works do not exist because they were painted on dirt mounds with colored sand, this practice still remains in Tibet as part of ascetic training on the occasion of rites or festivals.
Although the term 'mandala' is broadly interpreted in English as the cosmology in Hindu and other religions, it usually means paintings, and so on, that express the world view of Buddhism in Japanese.
Mandala' means Esoteric Buddhism mandala in the narrow sense, but in Japan, there are many works called 'mandala' other than those of Esoteric Buddhism, such as 'Jodo Mandala' which expresses Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (Western Pure Land) where Amida Nyorai (Buddha of Paradise) resides and 'Suijaku Mandala' of Shinto Religion, and their contents and styles of expression are also so diversified that it is difficult to define in a word what should be regarded as 'mandala.'
Esoteric Buddhism mandala works have geometric composition and all statues are painted as frontal views but they do not express three dimensional scenery and perspective.
However, all mandala works are not necessarily works that express such abstract space since Jodo mandala works express three dimensional space and many of the Shinto Religion mandala works express real scenery from the shrines' holy precinct.
The common characteristics of all mandala works are (1) they are composed of plural elements (Buddhist statutes, and so on) (2) these plural elements are not arranged at random but are arranged based on certain rules an/or meanings.
Esoteric Buddhism paintings that express a single Buddhist statute are not called mandala.
In a nutshell, 'mandala' is a painting that combines plural elements and express a certain religious world view as a whole.
There are a wide variety of mandala works according to their forms and uses.
Esoteric Buddhism mandala works are divided into the 4 categories shown below according to their forms (appearances).
Great Mandala - the one that express the statutes of Dainichi Nyorai (Cosmic Buddha) and other Buddha by means of painting.
This is what people usually imagine when they hear the term 'mandala.'
Samaya Mandala - the one that expresses various Buddha by means of the symbols that represent them, instead of painting them directly.
Instead of various Buddha, things like Vajra (weapons that defeat worldly desires), renge (lotus flowers), swords and bells are painted.
These things are called 'Samayagyo Symbol' and they are the symbols of each Buddha's enlightenment and actions.
Ho Mandala - the one that expresses a Buddha symbolically by means of a single letter (Sanskrit character, bonji (Siddhaṃ script)), instead of painting him directly.
It is also called 'Shuji Mandala' (Seed-Syllable Mandala) as a character that represents Buddha, and is called shuji in Buddhism (Esoteric Buddhism).
Katsuma Mandala - 'Katsuma' means 'actions or effects' in Sanskrit.
Katsuma Mandala is the one that expresses mandala by means of three dimensional statutes (sculptures), instead of plane paintings or symbols.
The mandala enshrined at Lecture Hall of To-ji Temple in Kyoto, which consists of 21 Buddhist statutes with Dainichi Nyorai situated in the center, was produced in accordance with the initiative of Kukai and is regarded as a kind of katsuma mandala.
According to the classification of mandala works based on contents, there exist Besson mandala (mandala of individual deities) in Esoteric Buddhism besides Ryokai Mandala (mandala of the two realms) that are the basis, and there are Jodo Mandala, Suijaku Mandala and Miya Mandala (literally Shrine Mandala) in other sects than Esoteric Buddhism.
Ryokai Mandala - It is also called 'Ryobu Mandala' and consists of 2 kinds of mandala, i.e. 'Vajradhatu Mandala' and 'Daihitaizosho Mandala' (mandala born of the womb of great compassion).
Vajradhatu mandala' and 'Daihitaizosho Mandala' were created based on 'Kongocho-kyo Sutra' (Vajrasekhara Sutra) and 'Daibirushana Jobutsu Jinbenkaji-kyo Sutra' (Mahavairocana Sutra), and both are the fundamental scriptures of Esoteric Buddhism, respectively and in these 2 kinds of mandala, many statutes of Buddha are arranged in a fixed order with Dainichi Nyorai, the fundamental Buddha of Esoteric Buddhism, situated in the center.
It represents Esoteric Buddhism's world view symbolically.
As for details, refer to the column of 'Ryokai Mandala.'
Besson Mandala - Unlike Ryokai Mandala, it is the one in which other statutes of Buddha than Dainichi Nyorai are situated in the center and is used as a principal image in the prayer for particular purposes such as peace of state and recovery from disease.
The purposes of prayer are normally categorized into 4 kinds, i.e. prosperity, protection, acquiring love and subduing demons.
Prosperity is the prayer for continuation of good things like longevity and/or good health, protection is the prayer for removing or allaying misfortunes like disease and/or disaster, acquiring love is the prayer for a good marital relationship and subduing demons is the prayer for beating back enemies respectively.
In this category, there exists Butsugen Mandala (literally Buddha-Eye Mandala), Ichijikinrin Mandala (One-Syllable Golden Wheel Mandala), Sonsho Mandala (Mandala composed of holy spirits of Mahavairocana's parietal region), Hokke Mandala (lotus mandala), Horokaku Mandala (Jeweled Pavilion Mandala) and Ninnogyo Mandala (the Sutra of Benevolent Kings Mandala), and so on.
Jodo Mandala - Jodo (pure land) means the sanctuary or perfect land where each Buddha resides, such as jodo of Miroku Buddha (Maitreya) and jodo of Yakushi Nyorai (the Healing Buddha), but when simply referring to 'jodo,' it usually means Saiho Gokuraku Jodo of Amida Nyorai.
Jodo Mandala is the one that concretely expresses the image of Amida jodo which is advocated in 'Kanmuryo Jukyo Sutra' (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) and other scriptures.
While these works are called 'jodo henso-zu' (the picture describing Buddhist Heaven and Pure Land) in China, they are called mandala in Japan.
Based on patterns and contents, Jodo mandala works in Japan are categorized into 3 kinds, i.e. Chiko Mandala, Taima Mandala and Seikai Mandala, and these are collectively called Jodo Sanmandala (three Jodo mandala).
Suijaku Mandala - The philosophy which advocates that deities of the Japanese Shinto Religion are various Buddha from Buddhism that appear tentatively in different figures, is called Honji-Suijaku Setsu (Honji-Suijaku thesis).
According to this thesis, various Buddha, which are the original figures of Deities, are called 'Honjibutsu' (Honji Buddha) and deities originating from Honjibutsu are called 'Suijakushin' (Suijaku deity).
The works that express the deities of a particular shrine in the style of mandala, while assuming them to be Honjibutsu or Suijakushin, are called Suijaku Mandala.
There also are many kinds of Suijaku Mandala works such as those expressing only Honjibutsu, those expressing only Suijakushin and those expressing both.
Typical examples are Kumano Mandala (Devotional paintings of the three shrines of Kumano), Kasuga Mandala (Mandala form that sprang from Kasuga-Taisha Shrine) and Hie Sanno mandala (Mandala having to do with Hie Sannosha Shrine).
Each of them depicts the enshrined deities of Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha) in Wakayama Prefecture, Kasuga Taisha in Nara Prefecture and Hiyoshi Taisha, which is Chinju (local Shinto deity) of Mt. Hiei, respectively.
Miya Mandala - Some works that depict neither Honjibutsu nor Suijakushin but depict the scenery of a shrine's holy precinct are also called 'Mandala.'
These works are considered to have depicted a shrine's holy precinct as sanctuary or jodo.
Other than the above, there exists many kinds of painting works that are called 'mandala' regardless of being those of Buddhism or the Shinto Religion.
Moji Mandala - It was invented by Nichiren and depicts chants and various Buddha by means of letters (Chinese characters) instead of paintings.
This is called Ita Mandala (board mandala) or Hige Mandala (beard mandala) because of its distinguishing characteristics of a long line drawn from the title lettering situated in the center.
Sects belonging to Fujimon school including the Nichiren Shoshu sect, enshrine Nichiren's mandala as their principal image (Nichiren Shoshu sect calls it Honmon no kaidan no dai gohonzon).
In other sects like Icchi school, mandala are not necessarily their principal image.
Tibetan Mandala - A mandala of Tibetan Buddhism.
There exist many kinds of mandala works including those that depict various Buddha or rokudo-rinne (Rebirth in the Six Worlds) and Sand mandala which was produced with colored sand is also well known.
Soho TAKUAN (January 3, 1574 - January 27, 1646) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect who was active in the Edo period.
He was the juji (chief priest) of Daitoku-ji Temple.
He was born in Izushi in Tajima Province (present-day, Izushi-cho, Toyoka City, Hyogo Prefecture).
He was once exiled to Dewa Province because of his involvement in the Shie Incident but was later pardoned and subsequently founded Tokai-ji Temple (Shinagawa-ku Ward, Tokyo) in Edo.
He was familiar not only with painting, calligraphy and poetry but also with Chanoyu (the tea ceremony) and he left many bakuseki (writing, especially of a Zen monk).
Although he is widely believed to be the inventor of takuanzuke (pickled daikon radish), there are many views on this subject (refer to the column on takuanzuke).
On January 3, 1574, he was born as the second son of Tsunanori, Noto no kami (the governor of Noto Province), AKIBA in Izushi, Tajima Province.
His father, Tsunanori AKIBA, was a senior vassal of Suketoyo YAMANA, then the castellan of Izushi-jo Castle in Tajima Province.
When he was eight years old, the Yamana family was ruined by the invasion of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and his father became a ronin (masterless samurai).
When he was ten years old, Takuan became a priest at Shonen-ji Temple in Izushi and was granted Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist names) of Shuno.
When he was 14 years old, he joined Sukyo-ji Temple in Izushi and studied under Saido KISEN.
He changed his name to Shuki.
In 1591, when Saido KISEN passed away, Nagayasu MAENO, who had become the castellan of Izushi-jo Castle by then, invited Sochu TOHO, a disciple of Soen SHUNOKU, from Daitoku-ji Temple as the chief priest of Sukyo-ji Temple.
Takuan then studied under Sochu.
In 1594, Toho went up to Kyoto as he became the juji of Daitoku-ji Temple and Takuan followed him and joined Daitoku-ji Temple.
At Daitoku-ji Temple, he studied under Soen SHUNOKU of Sangenin Temple and changed his name to Soho.
After the demise of Toho, he moved to Sakai City in Izumi Province.
In Sakai, he studied under Shoteki ITTO of Yoshunin of Nanshu-ji Temple and was granted hogo (a Buddhist name) of Takuan in 1604.
In 1607, Takuan became shuso (the leader of monks practicing asceticism) of Daitoku-ji Temple and while residing at Tokuzen-ji Temple situated in Daitoku-ji Temple, he also became the chief priest of Nanshu-ji Temple.
In 1609, he was promoted to the 154th chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple at 37, but Takuan, who didn't seek fame and wealth, left Daitoku-ji Temple three days after his promotion and returned to Sakai.
In 1620, he returned to his birthplace Izushi and lived in a hermitage built at Sukyo-ji Temple, which had been revived by Yoshihide KOIDE, then the lord of a domain.
This hermitage was named Toenken.
After the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was established, its control of temples became tighter through the establishment of jiinhatto (laws for temples), and so on.
In particular, against the influential temples such as Daitoku-ji Temple, regulations aiming to weaken their ties with the Imperial Court, called Kinchu Narabini Kuge Shohatto (Laws for Aristocrats), were also imposed.
In these acts, it was stipulated that a priest who assumed the position of juji of Daitoku-ji temple was nominated by Edo bakufu, instead of the imperial decree issued by the Emperor, and only priests who obtained the approval of bakufu were allowed to wear sie (the purple Buddhist priest stole) granted by the Emperor.
In 1627, the bakufu annulled Emperor Gomizunoo's charter that allowed the wearing of sie by reason of violating the acts and ordered Kyoto Shoshidai (The Kyoto deputy) to confiscate the sie in question.
Takuan, who opposed bakufu's decision, went up to Kyoto in a hurry, organized monks of Daitoku-ji Temple in cooperation with Sohaku, a former chief priest, and launched a campaign against it together with Tanden and Togen of Myoshin-ji Temple.
In 1629, the bakufu exiled Takuan, Sohaku, Tanden and Togen to Kaminoyama City in Dewa Province, Tanakura in Mutsu Province, Yuri in Mutsu Province and Tsugaru, respectively.
In 1632, the Ordinance of Amnesty was issued when Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA passed away and those priests who had been involved in the Shie Incident were pardoned thanks to the efforts of Tenkai and Munenori YAGYU.
"Fudochi Shinmyo Roku" (The Miracle of Immovable Wisdom), which compiled letters which Takuan had sent to Munenori YAGYU, is well-known as the one preaching 'Kenzen ichimi' (The Sword and Zen are One).
Takuan then went to Edo and joined Kanda Kotoku-ji Temple.
Takuan, however, was not allowed to return immediately to Kyoto and in the winter of the same year, he moved to Naoyori HORI's second house located in Komagome and stayed there until the summer of 1634.
When Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA came up to Kyoto after Takuan had returned to Daitoku-ji Temple together with Sohaku, he had an audience with Iemitsu due to the exhortation of Munenori YAGYU and Naoyori HORI.
From that time, Iemitsu became a devout believer of Takuan.
In the same year, he returned to his birthplace Izushi but in the following year, he again went to Edo in response to an eager request made by Iemitsu.
Takuan did not want to stay in Edo but he could not return to his birthplace because of Iemitsu's strong request.
Iemitsu constructed Tokai-ji Temple on Mt. Bansho at Shinagawa and nominated Takuan as its juji.
Iemitsu often consulted with Takuan concerning political matters.
The above are believed to be conciliatory measures by Iemitsu.
Conversely, it shows the fact about how strong Takuan's influence was.
On January 27, 1646, Takuan passed away in Edo.
Although his graves exist at Sukyo-ji Temple and Tokai-ji Temple, Takuan used to say that he didn't need a grave.
Takuan's words and deeds in his later years could be interpreted as his apostasy or the fact that he was won over to Iemitsu's side.
Under such circumstance, historical assessment of Takuan is not yet determined.
It is generally believed that takuanzuke, pickled daikon, was invented by Takuan or was spread by Takuan in Edo while it had been popular only in the Kansai region.
According to the latter view, it is believed that when Takuan served takuwaezuke (literally, pickle to preserve) of daikon to Iemitsu taking the opportunity of his visit to Tokai-ji Temple, Iemitsu was satisfied with it and said 'It should be named Takuanzuke rather than takuwaezuke,' but this is no more than hearsay.
Takuan is often connected with Musashi in fiction.
In Miyamoto Musashi written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA, for example, he is depicted as a key person who bears the role of admonishing Musashi.
Shushin GIDO (February 8, 1325 - May 18, 1388) was a priest of the Rinzai sect who was active from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts to the Muromachi period.
Donin KUGE.
He was born in Takaoka of Tosa Province (Tsuno-cho, Takaoka-gun, Kochi Prefecture).
At Mt. Hiei, he became a disciple of Soseki MUSO who was closely acquainted with the Ashikaga Shogun family.
In 1359, he moved to Kamakura in response to the invitation of Motouji ASHIKAGA, then the Kamakura kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region), the position which bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) established for the purpose of governing the Kanto region, and taught the Zen sect to Motouji as well as the Uesugi clan of Kanto Kanrei (A shogunal deputy for the Kanto region).
In 1379, he went up to Kyoto and became something similar to a private tutor for the 3rd shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.
He exhorted the construction of Shokoku-ji Temple, served as the chief priest of Kennin-ji Temple, became the chief priest of Nanzen-ji Temple in 1386 and further served as the chief priest of Toji-ji Temple.
Along with Myoha SHUNOKU and Chushin ZEKKAI, he is well-known for his familiarity with Chinese culture and is considered as a representative Kyoto Gozan (Five Great zen Temples of Kyoto) academic priest.
Ryokei ONISHI (December 21, 1875 - February 15, 1983) was a Hosso Sect Buddhist monk who served as head priest of Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto and in his later years was also renowned for holding the record as the oldest person in Japan.
He passed away in 1983 aged 108 years.
He was born in Nara Prefecture and went under the pseudonym 'Muin.'
In 1889, he went to Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara where he entered the Buddhist priesthood under Teicho CHIHAYA.
In 1890, he studied the yuishiki (consciousness-only theory) under Join SAEKI of Horyu-ji Temple.
In 1899, he became the 231st head priest of Kofuku-ji Temple and was appointed chief abbot of the Hosso Sect in 1904.
In 1914, he was appointed head priest of Kiyomizu-dera Temple but retained his position as head priest of Kofuku-ji Temple.
In 1965, he established the Kita Hosso Sect headquartered at Kiyomizu-dera Temple and assumed the position of chief abbot.
He had a deep knowledge of Buddhist sects other than the Hosso Sect and successively held several important positions within the world of Buddhism.
His Buddhist sermons known as Ryokei no Sechi were highly popular.
He is also famous as the godparent of the first quintuplets in Japan, which were born in Kagoshima Prefecture in 1976.
Ryogen (912 - January 31, 985) was a priest of the Tendai Sect who was active in the Heian period.
His posthumous name was Jie Daishi.
He was commonly known as Gansan Daishi.
He was known as the person who rendered the most meritorious service for the restoration of Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei.
Although Ryogen was the 18th Tendai-zasu (the supreme position in the Tendai Sect) and a real-life person, he has been the target of folk belief since the medieval period and even in the 21st century, he is worshipped as 'Yakuyoke Daishi' (Calamity Dispelling Master).
In 912, Ryogen was born as a son of the Kozu clan, then the local Gozoku (local ruling family), in Torahime, Asai-gun, Omi Province (present-day, Torahime-cho, Higashi-Asai-gun, Shiga Prefecture).
He was called Kannonmaru (or Hiyoshimaru) in his childhood.
When he was 12 years old (or 15 years old), he went up to Mt. Hiei and became a Buddhist priest.
Although Ryogen was not a direct disciple of Saicho (Dengyo Daishi) and his rank was not high, he gradually distinguished himself as an able priest through refuting high priests of traditional Buddhist temples in Nanto (southern capital (Nara)) or praying safe delivery of a child for the Empress of Emperor Murakami, and finally he achieved Tendai-zasu, the supreme position in the Tendai Sect, in 966.
When Ryogen became Tendai-zasu, Enryaku-ji Temple was devastated as it had lost many doto (temple halls and towers) including Konpon-chudo Hall, due to the big fire that broke out in 935.
A fire broke out also in 966, the year when Ryogen became Tendai-zasu, but Ryogen reconstructed doto which was destroyed by fire, with the support of FUJIWARA no Morosuke, the maternal relative of Emperor Murakami (father of the Empress).
Further, he reconstructed Konpon-chudo Hall, which was a small hall when it was initially constructed by Saicho, as a magnificent hall and laid the foundations of Mt. Hiei's garan (ensemble of temple buildings).
In 970, he enacted 'Nijurokkajo Kisho' (26 Points sworn oath) which stipulated disciplinary regulations in the temple and strived to suppress armed priests' violence.
Ryogen is revered as the person who rendered the most meritorious service for the restoration of Enryaku-ji Temple thanks to his various achievements, including the reconstruction of Mt. Hiei's garan, the rise of Tendai Doctrinal Studies and the maintenance of discipline in the precinct.
He had many disciples and among them, Genshin (Eshin Sozu), the author of "Ojoyoshu" (The Essentials of Salvation), was famous in particular.
Although his Shigo (posthumous name) granted by the Imperial Court was Jie Daishi, he was commonly known as 'Gansan Daishi' since the anniversary of his death is January 3rd.
At the site of Ryogen's old residence, called Joshinbo, in Yokawa on Mt. Hiei, there is a Shiki Kodo (Four Seasons Lecture Hall) (it is so named because a lecture of Hoke-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra) was conducted at this hall once every four seasons) and it is called 'Gansandaishi-do' as Ryogen's image is enshrined in it.
Jie Daishi, Ryogen, has various other names such as 'Tsuno Daishi' (The Horned Master), 'Mame Daishi' (the Master of the Beans) and 'Yakuyoke Daishi' and these are worshipped by a wide range of people.
It is believed that Ryogen was the founder of 'omikuji' (sacred lots) which is now seen at many temples and shrines throughout the nation.
A lot of Ryogen's sculptures and paintings called 'The image of Jie Daishi,' especially those produced in the Kamakura period, exist in many halls and temples inside the precinct of Mt. Hiei as well as other temples belonging to the Tendai Sect.
These images have standardized appearances as the image for worshipping and their common characteristics are that they have slanted-eyed, severe facial expressions while holding juzu (beadroll), and tokkosho (a pestle with a single sharp blade at each end, found as an attribute of Buddhist guardian figures, and a symbolic item in Esoteric Buddhism) (a kind of Buddhist tool) in the hands.
Tsuno Daishi - It is a painting that depicts an ogre that has 2 horns and is so thin and is nothing but skin and bones.
According to legend, it is the image of Ryogen when he repelled a Yakubyo-gami (a deity of the transmission of epidemics) by transforming himself into an ogre.
Paintings of Tsuno Daishi were stuck on houses located in Sakamoto, at the foot of Mt. Hiei, and Kyoto as talismans for amulet.
Mame Daishi - It is a painting that depicts 33 bean-sized images of Jie Daishi on paper.
As Jie Daishi (Ryogen) is believed to be the incarnation of Kannon, this painting depicts 33 images of Jie Daishi based on the teaching of 'Hoke-kyo Sutra' that advocates that Kannon transforms itself into 33 figures in order to rescue Sattva.

Juzu (数珠) is a Buddhist ritual implement and a kind of ring composed of many beads which are linked by piercing a bundle of threads into a hole made on each bead.
As it means beads that are used when praying to Buddha, it is also called 'nenju' (praying beadroll).
In Sanskrit, it is called 'hasoma.'
While praying to Buddha, it is used for the purpose of rubbing, jingling and/or counting frequency of mantra and Buddhist invocation.
In sects that do not care about the frequency of Buddhist invocation, such as Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), it is used as a symbol of reverence to Buddha.
Generally, it is hung on hands that are put flat together on the occasions of Buddhist rites, Buddhist memorial services and/or praying to Buddha, Bodhisattva, memorial tablet of the deceased.
The way to hang on the hands is different from sect to sect.
Monks sometimes hang it on the neck instead of hands.
Concerning its origin, there are various views but it is generally believed that the tool used by Brahmanism in Ancient India is the origin.
The above tool was used by Sakyamuni and introduced into China later.
Thereafter, it was introduced into Japan in the Asuka period along with the introduction of Buddhism.
In the Kamakura period, when Jodo-kyo (pure land teachings) prevailed and Invocation of the Buddha's Name became popular, it spread widely among ordinary people.
At present, there are bracelet-type juzu, called udewa nenju (or wanju, bracelet nenju), which are miniaturized juzu that uses elastic as an inner string so that it can be hung on the arms.
However, udewa nenju is not suitable for use for the original purpose of juzu, due to its size.
It must be handled with care since it is a Buddhist ritual implement.
When carrying it, it must be put into an exclusive bag such as a juzu bag (nenju bag).
When placing it, it must be put on a bag, a nenju bag or a handkerchief and must not be directly put on tatami mats, and so on.
It is generally believed that juzu should be held by the left hand with a tassel hanging down or should be hung on the left wrist.
It is believed that the number of 108 represents the number of earthly desires, each bead of juzu represents 108 Buddha who preside over each earthly desire and juzu suffers all earthly desires of human beings.
Juzu that are called 'Honren' (main strand), 'Niren' (two strand) or 'Nirin' (two loops) are ones that are composed of 108 beads of 'Omodama' (main beads) (refer to the name of beads).
It is usually used by making it into double rings.
Juzu that are called 'one handed' or 'informal' are ones that are composed of a decreased number of Omodama instead of the original number of 108.
The number of Omodama varies widely from 54 beads which is half of 108, 36 beads which is one third of 108, 27 beads which is a quarter of 108 to 18 beads which is one sixth of 108.
In recent years, juzu that are composed of the proper number of beads suitable for the size of the ring (size of a hand), instead of sticking to a particular number like 22 beads or 25 beads, are produced.
There exist juzu that are composed of 1080 beads called Hyakumanben-nenju (literally, one hundred times of nenju).
As for a unit in counting the number of beads, '... ball' (玉, tama) or '... grain' (顆, ka) are also used other than '... bead' (珠, tama).
In this column, 'bead' (珠) is to be used consistently.
In the case of Honren-juzu, the biggest bead (one bead or 2 beads) is called 'Oyadama' (parent bead) or 'Moshu' (mother bead) and the 108 beads which mainly compose a ring are called 'Omodama.'
4 beads which are smaller than Omodama and lie between Omodama are called 'Shitendama.'
Other than the above, beads which are called 'Deshidama' (disciple bead), 'Kikotomo,' 'Jomyo' (pure bead), 'Tsuyu' (dewdrop beads) and 'Fukudama' (sub bead) respectively are attached to tassels.
〔Details to be mentioned later since different beads are used depending on religious Doctrines.〕
In the case of one hand juzu, the number of Oyadama is only 1 and a tube-like bead called 'bosa' (Bodhisattva) is inserted between Oyadama and tassel.
Many beads which mainly compose a ring are called Omodama, likewise in the case of Niju-juzu (double ring juzu).
2 beads which are smaller than Omodama are called 'Nitendama' (literally, beads of two celestial).
The Chinese character of '玉' (tama) is also used, other than '珠' (tama), for the name of beads.
珠' is to be used in this column consistently.
By and large, the shapes of juzu beads are categorized into the following three kinds.
Marudama (round-bead)
Mikandama (elliptic type) - It can be easily handled when counting the frequency of mantra and Buddhist invocation.
Juzu that is composed of Mikandama looks meaty and sublime.
Monks tend to prefer Mikandama because of ease of handling and fine appearance (though there is a difference depending on sects).
Hiradama (flat-bead) - It is sometimes used in the Tendai sect but not in the Nichiren sect.
Although cloisonne enamel was recommended in old documents, beads made from various materials, such as lime tree, are used today.
Prices of juzu widely vary depending on the bead materials.
Women prefer fine-colored juzu that are made from crystal or coral.
As materials for high grade juzu, crystal with gold line (rutile quartz), feicui (Burma feicui), ivory, lapis lazuli and Bo tree, and so on, are used.
For cheap juzu, glass beads and/or plastic beads which resemble stone beads or coral beads are used.
Attention should be paid to the fact that there could be different rules on materials, color and the shape of tassels depending on doctrines and/or sects.
Ptincipal Materials for Beads
Jewelry and precious stones - crystal and the like (crystal, amethyst, smoky quartz, and so on), agate (onyx), feicui (Burma feicui), green aventurine, coral and the like and tourmaline, and so on.
Wood - ebony, rosewood, Bombay black wood, Japanese box tree, White cedar and amber, and so on.
Nuts of trees - Bo tree, Rudraksha, hogan linden, ryugan linden and kogan linden, and so on.
Nuts of grass - seigetsu linden and renge linden, and so on.
Fragrant wood - sandal wood and dwarf Japanese yew, and so on.
Ivory
Glass
Celluloid
Pure silk and rayon (polyester) is used.
As for the shape of tassel, there are several basic patterns such as kashiratsuki tassel (literally, tassel with a head), kiri tassel (cutting tassel), yori tassel (getting together tassel), yotsumehimo tassel (four-eyed string tassel), kiku tassel (or Brahma tassel, chrysanthemum tassel) and Rikyu tassel (or temari ball tassel) but depending on craftsmen, these could be further broken down.
Beads which are vulnerable to harmful insects, such as those made from Bo tree, must be kept in a paulownia box or treated with insecticide.
Particular caution is required in handling fragile and/or soft beads such as those made from coral or pearl.
As the beads made from lapis lazuli, red coral, pearl or malachite are vulnerable to sweat, these must be kept in a paulownia box after wiping off sweat.
The following are general explanations concerning the forms of formal juzu for ordinary lay believers.
In selecting juzu, it is vital to confirm with a family temple or consult with a specialty store.
Juzu for the Tendai sect uses 108 beads of Omodama, a bead of Oyadama and 4 beads of Shitendama to compose a ring.
These beads are arranged in the following order; 1 bead of Oyadama=>7 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>66 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>7 beads of Omodama, and finally they are shaped as a ring.
1 small bead called 'Jomyo' is attached at the knot of a tassel made under Oyadama.
2 tassels are attached under Jomyo.
Various shapes are used for tassels (kiku tassel and Rikyu tassel (kemari tassel) are often used).
Deshidama is attached to each tassel.
Each Deshidama has its characteristics since Deshidama attached to one tassel is composed of 10 beads of Marudama and Deshidama attached to the other tassel is composed of 20 beads of Hiradama.
A tear-shaped bead called 'Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
The characteristics of the Tendai sect juzu is that flat beads called Hiradama (Sorobandama) are used for Omodama.
The way of holding (in case of Chuin school) - A prayer should hang Moshu on the middle finger of the right hand and hang odome (literally, lacing up the thong) on the forefinger of the left hand.
At that time, a prayer should twist nenju once so that its shape becomes the shape of an X.
When putting hands flat together in prayer, a prayer should put both tassels into the palms.
Then, a prayer should rub them 2 to 3 times slightly with the left hand up and the palm downward, while the right hand is down and its palm upward and should then stop rubbing by pulling the right hand towards himself/herself.
When holding juzu in Isso (a ring), it should be hung on the left wrist and in this case, it should be hung in a manner where Moshu is placed on the wrist of the left hand.
If and when a prayer holds juzu in Isso, he/she can make a sutra recitation while holding a sutra text in the right hand since the right hand is free.
There is no problem for lay believers (Buddhist supporters) to hold juzu according to Chuin school.
As for juzu for the Shingon sect, the number of Omodama and Shitendama used for a ring is the same as with juzu for the Tendai sect but the number of Oyadama is 2 beads.
These beads are arranged in the following order; 1 bead of Oyadama=>7 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>33 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Oyadama=>33 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>14 beads of Omodama=>1 bead of Shitendama=>7 beads of Omodama, and they finally form the shape of a ring.
One bead of Jomyo is attached only to the knot of a tassel that is attached to Oyadama situated on the side of Shitendama.
2 tassels are attached to each of 2 Oyadama (4 tassels in total).
Various shapes are used for tassels (kiku tassel and Rikyu tassel (kemari tassel) are often used).
5 beads of Deshidama and 1 bead of 'Tsuyu' are attached to each tassel (Deshidama: 20 beads in total, Tsuyu: 4 beads in total).
Formal juzu of the Shingon sect for females, for which the length is approximately 24 cm, are called juzu for Hasshu sect (eight sects) and are on sale as one which is usable irrespective of sect.
An example in the design of juzu used by monks of the Shingon sect is the one which is composed of 108 beads, red kansen (string to connect beads) and white tassels.
As for the reason why kansen is colored red, there are many theses but no established thesis.
One thesis asserts that kansen represents a blood vessel and/or blood since a life (a soul) dwells in juzu.
In the Shingon sect, designs of juzu belong to the category of phenomenon (courtesy and/or manners of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism).
There is no problem for lay believers (Buddhist supporters) to use juzu for monks (108 beads, red kansen, white tassels).
Godairiki nenju - This is nenju which Nyojitsu HOTTORI, the president of the Daigosan Denpo Gakuin (Denpo (the teachings of Buddhism) Academy on Mt. Daigo), ordered to be produced when his hope was achieved through devotion to Buddhism.
Although it is nenju of the Shingon sect, which is composed of 108 beads, its characteristics are the use of beads made from two kinds of materials, as well as tassels composed of strings of five different colors.
It is on sale at Daigo-ji Temple as a prize for awarding.
Juzu for Jodo Sect and Ji Sect has a unique shape which looks like one that has mixed the two juzu.
There exist some differences, such as the number of Omodama, between juzu for males and for females.
Oyadama is attached to each of 2 rings but tassels are not directly attached to Oyadama.
A small bead called 'Fukudama' is attached to one of two rings alternately with Omodama.
A metal double-ring is attached to the ring to which Fukudama is attached and 2 tassels are attached to the ring.
As for the shape of tassels, kiku tassel and Rikyu tassel (temari ball tassel) are mainly used.
1 bead of Jomyo is attached to the knot of the tassel.
Deshidama is attached to tassels.
6 beads of Marudama are attached to the one tassel and 10 beads of Hiradama are attached to the other.
1 bead of 'Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
It is also called Nikka (daily) nenju.
In the Jodo Sect, it is believed to be desirable to use formal Nenju.
Other than the above, a portable juzu that is composed of 36 beads or dai (big)-nenju called Hyakumanben-nenju are also used.
Juzu for males is called Sanman jodo (literally, thirty thousands of pure land, or Sanman-guri (thirty thousands of telling)) of which one ring is composed of 27 beads of Omodama and the other is composed of 20 beads of Omodama and 21 beads of Fukudama which are allocated alternately.
It is used for telling the juzu while reciting Buddhist invocation, and it is possible to recite 32,400 times (27 times 20 times 6 times10 makes 32,400) by telling the juzu with all beads other than Fukudama.
The above is the origin of the name.
Juzu for females is called Hassun jodo (literally, 24 cm of pure land, or Rokuman-guri (sixty thousands of telling)) of which one ring is composed of 40 beads of Omodama and the other is composed of 27 beads of Omodama and 28 beads of Fukudama.
The number of Deshidama is the same as that of Sanman jodo.
Therefore, it is possible to recite 64,800 times (40 times 27 times 6 times 10 makes 64,800), twice the number for males, by telling the juzu with all beads other than Fukudama.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, there is no practice to telling the nenju while reciting Buddhist invocation and therefore, no rule exists concerning the number of beads.
No rule exists concerning the materials of beads either.
The form of the nenju does not matter, but it is highly esteemed as a ritual implement to be used while putting hands flat together in prayer.
In the case of male believers : It is believed to be desirable to use a himo (code) tassel of one-handed nenju.
As there is no rule on the number of Omodama, the number is decided depending on the size of beads, and the nenju that is composed of 18 to 27 beads are generally used.
Female believers of the Hongan-ji School of the Jodo Shinshu Sect (O-nishi (Nishi Hongan-ji Temple)): Female believers are often recommended not to use Honren Nenju.
Although a one-handed nenju for females is usually composed of 36 beads, there is no particular rule on the number of beads.
For one-hand nenju for females, kiri tassel, kashiranashi yori tassel (twisted tassel, or shinmatsu tassel (new pine tassel) and kashiratsuki yori tassel (twisted tassels with head) are mainly used.
Female believers of the Otani School of the Jodo Shinshu Sect (O-higashi (Higashi Hongan-ji Temple): Likewise the case of O-nishi, one-hand nenju can be used.
Kiri tassel and shinmatsu tassel are mainly used for tassels.
Notwithstanding the above, there is no problem for females to use Honren nenju which is generally called hassun monto (literally, 24 cm for followers).
In hassun monto, number of Omodama and Oyadama, allocation of Shitendama are the same as the juzu of Shingon Sect.
Tassels have a distinctive feature because they are knotted in a unique manner, called 'rennyo-musubi' devised by Rennyo Shonin, so that they cannot be used for counting.
One bead of Jomyo is attached to the tassel attached to Oyadama of the Shitendama side and 5 beads of Deshidama are attached to the tip of each tassel knotted at the position of the 5th bead from Oyadama.
One bead of 'Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
In other words, Deshidama is packed upwards in an X shape so that they are fixed.
A knot (rennyo-musubi) is made on the tassel attached to Oyadama on the opposite side.
The tassel is attached without attaching Deshidama and 'Tsuyu.'
As for the shape of tassels, kashiratsuki tassel is mainly used.
The Way of Holding Honren Nenju
In the case of the Otani School, it should be used in the form of a double ring with 2 beads of Oyadama fixed at a thumb and 4 tassels hung down on the left side.
It should be hung on a hand with Oyadama of the Deshidama side situated at the fingertip side and Oyadama of the rennyo-musubi side situated at the body side.
In the case of Hongan-ji School, it should be used in the form of a double ring and the tassels should be hung down.
Although large-sized Honren nenju for males, with a length of over 38 cm and which have a nagafusa (long tassel), are seen, it is basically shozoku nenju (nenju for costume) for monks.
As for juzu of the Rinzai Sect, the number and allocation of Omodama, Oyadama and Shitendama are the same as those of the Tendai Sect.
However, the shape of Omodama is marudama.
Bosa' (literally, Bosatsu (Bodhisattava)) is attached to Oyadama.
Jomyo and Deshidama are not attached.
While himo tassel is often used, kiri tassel is also used.
As for juzu of the Soto Sect, the number and allocation of Omodama, Oyadama and Shitendama are the same as those of the Shingon Sect.
A tassel is attached only to Oyadama on the Shitendama side.
The shape of the tassel is almost the same as that of the Rinzai Sect.
Oyadama to which a tassel is attached is slightly bigger than one to which a tassel is not attached.
Bosa' also is attached to Oyadama to which a tassel is attached.
Although it looks like juzu for Rinzai Sect, juzu for Soto Sect have a distinctive feature of using a metal ring called hyakuhachi-kankin (literally, one hundred and eight golden ring).
A silver ring is sometimes used for high-grade juzu.
Juzu for Nichiren Sect
As for juzu for the Nichiren Sect, the number and allocation of Omodama, Oyadama and Shitendama are the same as those of the Shingon Sect.
Tassels have a distinctive feature since tassels attached to Oyadama are not symmetrical.
2 tassels with a bead of Jomyo are attached to Oyadama (also called Jomyodama) situated on the Shitendama side (the side to be hung on the middle finger of the right hand) and knots are made on each tassel at the position of the 5th beads from Oyadama and 5 beads of Deshidama are attached on their tips.
Tsuyu' is attached to the tip of each Deshidama.
3 tassels are attached to Oyadama (also called odome) situated on the side where Shitendama doesn't exist (the side to be hung on the middle finger of the left hand) and a knot is situated under Oyadama.
Out of 3 tassels, 5 beads of Deshidama as well as 'Tsuyu' are attached to 2 tassels for each.
The remaining 1 tassel called "kazutori" (counting) is shorter than the other 2 tassels and 10 beads of Deshidama are attached to it.
Tsuyu' is not attached to "kazutori."
In the Nichiren Sect, even lay believers must use formal nenju (informal nenju is not be used).
- The above explanations are basically made regarding juzu for lay believers.
As for juzu for monks, the above may not be applicable since there are more detailed rules concerning costumes, and so on.
- There are subtle differences in the designs of juzu depending on sects/schools.
- In some regions, there are restrictions on the color of beads and/or tassels.
(For funeral, Omodama (white or transparent), tassels (white); for Buddhist memorial service, Omodama (colored ones), tassels (colored tassels), and so on.)
Custom-made juzu are available at some shops specialized in nenju.
Juzu of gradation, such as the ones made from crystal or amethyst, which is not available on the market, are also available.
Juzu should be repaired before the inner string is broken.
When tassels are damaged, they can be replaced under normal conditions.
By replacing the inner string, juzu, especially the expensive one or the one of a keepsake, can be used for a long time.
It is said that the color of juzu made from Bo tree or seigetsu linden (unbleached) will gradually change the color in amber over time and have depth to its color.
Repairs are undertaken by shops specializing in nenju or Buddhist altar stores which deal with the repair of juzu.
There exist some people who do not replace an inner string based on the thought that the cutting of string leads to the cutting of mishap.
For the same reason, it is believed that the natural cutting of string doesn't necessarily mean bad luck.
8 reidama (spirit beads) which appear in "Nanso Satomi hakken den" (The story of eight dog samurai and a princess of Satomi family in Nanso region) are 8 big beads that flown from crystal-made juzu that was possessed by Princess Fusehime and the remaining 100 small beads are connected and becomes juzu that Chudai hoshi possesses.
Similar things are used in other religions, such as Rosario in Christianity.
Sometimes juzu is written in Chinese characters as '珠数' instead of '数珠' by changing the order of each Chinese character.
According to the grammar of the Chinese language, which is the origin of a pair of these Chinese characters, a verb should be placed before a noun and this is the reason why 'juzu' is written as '数珠.'
In Chinese, 'to count the number of beads' is written as '数珠.'
Inso is a Buddhist and Hinduism term which refers to the gesture of the hands having a certain symbolic meaning.
It is a translation of a Sanskrit term mudraa, which originally means 'seal,' 'stamp,' and so forth.
In Japanese terms, it has the same meaning as the term ingei (印契) or its simplified form in (印), referring mainly to the symbolic gesture of a Buddhist statue.
There are several fixed patterns of inso in a Buddhist statue existing in a Buddhist temple or the like, which include the followings: one formed by hands clasped in the lap, like that of Kamakura Daibutsu (the Great Buddha of Kamakura); one formed by the right hand being raised and the left hand resting on the lap, like that of the huge image of Rushana Buddha of Todai-ji Temple.
Each form of inso has a doctrinal meaning that represents the details, nature and function of the spiritual awakening experienced by a Buddha; accordingly, ascertaining what form of inso is assumed by a Buddhist image allows, to some extent, the guessing of what Buddha is represented by the image.
Buddhas and Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) assuming various forms of inso are depicted in mandala (place of practicing Buddhism to attain spiritual enlightenment) of Esoteric Buddhism; however, this column briefly explains about several typical types of inso that are seen in Buddhist temples, and so on.
Major Types of Inso
Semui-in (mudra for bestowing fearlessness)
It is the inso formed by a hand raised with the palm facing outward.
As the meaning of the kanji, this is a sign indicating to a viewer that he or she 'does not need to fear' to encourage him or her.
It is assumed by Fukujoju Nyorai (Amoghasiddhi, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas).
Yogan-in (wish-granting mudra)
It is the inso formed by a hand pointing downward with the palm facing outward.
In the case of a seated statue, the palm may face upward; in this case, however, the finger side of the palm is tilted downward so that a viewer can see the palm.
This form imitates a gesture made when a person gives something to others and is assumed by Hosho Nyorai Hosho Nyorai (Ratnasambhava, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas), and so on.
Semui-Yogan-in
It is the inso formed by a combination of the right hand taking the form of Semui-in and the left hand taking the form of Yogan-in.
In the case of a seated statue, the palm of the left hand points upward while resting on the lap.
This is a sign indicating that believers' wishes will be granted.
Semui-Yogan-in is one of the typical forms of inso shown by an statue of nyorai (Tathagata), and many statues of Shakyamuni Nyorai show inso of this form.
An statue of nyorai with the palm of the left hand taking the form of Yogan-in and bearing a medicine pot is a statue of Yakushi Nyorai (the healing Buddha).
However, some of the statues of Yakushi Nyorai lack a medicine pot because of loss or originally there was no medicine pot.
In addition, some of the statues of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) represent Semui-Yogan-in; therefore, it is impossible in many cases to identify what Buddha is represented by this inso only.
Figure 1 shows Tian Tan Buddha assuming Semui-Yogan-in, which is located in Lantau Island, Hong Kong.
Tenborin-in (teaching mudra)
It is one of the forms of inso that may be assumed by Shakyamuni Nyorai, which is formed by both hands turned upward in front of the chest with the tips of the thumbs of both hands put together and the tips of the same fingers of both hands put together to form a circle.
This imitates a gesture made when a person explains something to another, and therefore is called Seppo-in (the term "seppo" means preaching).
The term 'tenborin' refers literally to spinning the dharma wheel and metaphorically to 'expounding the truth.'
Because of the existence of many patterns for which fingers and a thumb are put together, in what direction a palm is oriented (outward, inward, upward or otherwise), and so forth, there are many variations of this inso.
In the case of Shakyamuni Nyorai depicted in Shakyamuni-in (one of the 12 sections ("in" in Japanese) constituting Taizokai mandala) in Taizokai ((Womb Realm) mandala, for example, the right and left hands face outward and inward, respectively, with the finger tips of both hands pointing upward.
In this case, the right hand represents preaching to the audience while the left hand represents preaching to oneself.
Jo-in (samadhi mudra, gesture of meditation)
It is used with a seated statue formed by the palms of both hands facing upward and put on top of one another in front of the abdomen (in the lap).
This indicates that the Buddha is absorbed in contemplation (meditation).
It is assumed by Shakyamuni Nyorai or Dainichi Nyorai (the Great Sun Buddha) (in Taizokai) formed by the right hand put on top of the left hand with the tips of both thumbs put together and other fingers stretched.
This gesture is specifically called Hokkaijo-in, which is famous for being taken on the occasion of Zen meditation.
According to Esoteric Buddhism, Jo-in assumed by Amida Nyorai is supposed to be Hokkaijo-in; however, a variation formed by both hands placed together in the same manner and the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the middle or annular fingers) forming a circle may be assumed by Amida Nyorai of the Jodo Sect, and so on.
There are many variations of inso assumed by Amida Nyorai, which will be explained in full detail.
Sokuchi-in (Earth-Touching Mudra)
It is also referred to as Goma-in (literally, mudra of conquering the devil).
It is used with a seated statue and formed by a palm facing downward with finger tips touching the earth.
Shakyamuni is said, according to legend, to have sustained interference with his ascetic practices by a devil.
It is said that Shakyamuni touched the earth with finger tips at that time to cause a god of the earth to appear, thereby defeating the devil.
Therefore, Sokuchi-in symbolizes a strong mind pursuing the truth without being overcome by temptations or obstacles.
It is assumed by Ashuku Nyorai (Immovable Buddha) or Tenkuraion Nyorai (or Divyadundubhimeganirghosa, literally, Buddha of Thunderous Sound of the Heavenly Drum) besides Shakyamuni Nyorai.
Chiken-in (the knowledge-fist mudra)
It is formed by the left hand with the forefinger stretched and the thumb clenched by the middle, annular and little fingers.
And the right hand clenching the forefinger of the left hand with the tip of the thumb of the right hand and the tip of the forefinger of the left hand put together.
It is assumed by Dainichi Nyorai (in the diamond-world mandala), Ichiji Kinrin Buccho (the principal Buddha of the "Court of the Perfected") or Taho Nyorai (Prabhuta-ratnam in Sanskrit).
Kozanze-in (Mudra of Subjection)
It is formed by the little fingers firmly crossed in front of the chest.
Types of Inso Assumed by Amida Nyorai
There are several types of inso assumed by Amida Nyorai, any of which is formed in principle by the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the middle or annular fingers) forming a circle.
Jo-in
It is formed as mentioned above.
In the case of Amida Nyorai, there may be a statue assuming inso formed by both hands pointing upward in front of the chest with the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the second or third fingers) forming a circle.
Examples of statues assuming Jo-in existing in Japan include the principal statue in Hoo-do Hall (the Phoenix Pavilion) of Byodoin Temple in Uji City and the principal statue in Kotokuin Temple in Kamakura City (Kamakura Great Buddha) shown in Figure 2.
Seppo-in (the exposition of the Dharma mudra)
It refers to Tenborin-in.
It is formed by both hands pointing upward in front of the chest with the thumbs and the forefingers (or otherwise, the middle or annular fingers) forming a circle.
Examples of statues assuming Tenborin-in existing in Japan include the principal statue enshrined in the hall of Koryu-ji Temple in Kyoto; however, this inso is relatively rare.
The central Buddhist image in Taima mandala also assumes this inso.
Raigo-in (Reasoning Mudra)
Similar to Semui-Yogan-in, it is formed by the right hand turned upward and the left hand turned downward with both palms facing outward and the thumb and forefinger (or otherwise, the middle or annular finger) of each hand forming a circle.
This inso is assumed by Amida Nyorai coming to fetch a believer on his or her deathbed.
Examples of statues assuming Raigo-in existing in Japan include the central Buddhist statue among the statues of the three Amida divinities in Sanzenin Temple in Kyoto.
The principal statue enshrined in a temple of the Jodo sect or the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) assumes in principle this inso.
Figure 3 shows Ushiku Daibutsu (the Great Buddha of Ushiku) in Ibaraki Prefecture, which assumes Raigo-in.
In Joshin-ji Temple (commonly known as Kuhonbutsu) in Setagaya-ku Ward, Tokyo, nine statues of Amida Nyorai, which assume nine different types of inso respectively, are enshrined.
This is based on the idea of kubon-ojo (the nine classes of people reborn in the Land of Happiness according to the nine levels of religiousness), as preached in 'Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra' (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life, meaning Amida).
It is assumed that there are nine grades of gokuraku ojo (dying peacefully to be born in the Pure Land) from very religious people to accomplished villains as listed below: starting with 'jobon josho' (Upper grade: upper birth), 'jobon chusho' (Upper grade: middle birth), 'jobon gesho' (Upper grade: lower birth), 'chubon josho' (Middle grade: upper birth), 'chubon chusho' (Middle grade: middle birth), 'chubon gesho' (Middle grade: lower birth), 'gebon josho' (Lower grade: upper birth), 'gebon chusho' (Lower grade: middle birth) and 'gebon gesho' (Lower grade: lower birth).
In the case of the nine statues of Amida Nyorai enshrined in Joshin-ji Temple, the three types of inso assumed by Amida Nyorai, that is, Jo-in, Seppo-in and Raigo-in are assigned as 'Josho-in' (inso representing josho (upper birth)), 'Chusho-in' (inso representing chusho (middle birth)) and 'Gesho-in' (inso representing gesho (lower birth)), respectively, and combinations of the thumbs and the forefingers put together, those of the thumbs and the middle fingers put together and those of the thumbs and the annular fingers put together are assigned to 'jobon' (upper grade), 'chubon' (middle grade) and 'gebon' (lower grade), respectively.
It should be noted, however, that there are no explicit doctrinal grounds for the representation of kuhon ojo (nine grades of birth in the Pure Land) by nine types of inso and they seem to have been contrived in early-modern times in Japan.
Inso Referring to the Design of a Seal
The design of a seal imprint is called inso, and fortune may be told from such a design.
A symmetric arrangement of characters is assumed to be inauspicious; moreover, fortune is told from the appearance of the fracture of a seal arising from long-term use.
Zenjo ANO (1153 - August 8, 1203) was a priest from late Heian period to early Kamakura period and the seventh son of MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.
He was also known as Hokkyo (the third highest rank for Buddhist priests) Zenjo (or Zensei) ANO.
His mother was Tokiwa Gozen.
His childhood name was Imawakamaru.
Gien and MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune were his younger brothers by the same mother, and MINAMOTO no Yoritomo was his elder brother by a different mother.
His wife was Awa no Tsubone (Tokimasa HOJO's daughter).
His children included: Harimanokimi (the lord of Harima Province) Yorimasa, and Tokimoto ANO, a wife of FUJIWARA no Kimisuke (藤原公佐室).
Since Imawaka's father Yoshitomo was defeated and died in the Heiji War when he was at an early age of 7 in 1159, he was forced to enter the priesthood at Daigo-ji Temple and named himself Ryucho (隆超) (or Ryuki (隆起)), then Zenjo after a short while.
He was commonly known as Daigo Zenji (Master of Zen Buddhism), or Aku (evil) Zenji from his crudeness ("Heiji Monogatari" (The Tale of Heiji).
On September 15, 1180, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, his elder brother by a different mother, raised an army in Izu Province.
Upon knowing this fact, Zenjo slipped out of the temple and happened to meet Sadatsuna SASAKI and Sadatsuna's brothers shortly after Yoritomo was defeated in the Battle of Ishibashiyama on September 24, and was given refuge by them in Shibuya no sho Manor in Sagami Province.
On October 28, he managed to meet Yoritomo at a lodging in Saginuma, Shimousa Province.
This was the first reunion of members of the Minamoto clan.
Zenjo told Yoritomo that he had secretly slipped out of the temple in Kyoto upon knowing about ryoji (orders issued by princes, empresses, and so on) and then went down to the place having disguised himself as a trainee priest, and Yoritomo appreciated Zenjo's resolution by weeping with joy.
Winning Yoritomo's confidence, Zenjo was rewarded with Nagao-ji Temple in Musashi Province (the present Myoraku-ji Temple in Tama-ku Ward, Kawasaki City) and married Awa no Tsubone (a daughter of Tokimasa HOJO) who was a younger sister of Masako HOJO, Yoritomo's wife.
Awa no Tsubone became a wet nurse for the second son of Yoritomo, Senmanmaru (later MINAMOTO no Sanetomo), and thereafter established an unspectacular but solid position in the Yoritomo administration.
However, Yoritomo's death and the succession to the office of a shogun by MINAMOTO no Yoriie (Zenjo's nephew) in 1199 resulted in Zenjo being allied with Tokimasa HOJO (Zenjo's father-in-law) and Yoshitoki HOJO (Zenjo's brother-in-law) who supported MINAMOTO no Sanetomo and came to be opposed to Yoriie's followers.
Yoriie moved one step ahead of Zenjo and dispatched Nobumitsu TAKEDA around midnight on July 6, 1203, to have him arrest Zenjo as a rebel and shut Zenjo up in Kamakura Gosho (the residence of a shogun of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)).
Zenjo was exiled to Hitachi Province on July 12 and killed on August 8 by Tomoie HATTA under orders of Yoritomo.
He was fifty-one years old.
On August 31, Harimanokimi Yorimasa, Zenjo's son, was killed at Higashiyama Ennen-ji Temple in Kyoto by an immediate vassal of the shogun residing in Kyoto.
The tomb of Zenjo exists in Daisen-ji Temple in Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, adjoining the tomb of Tokimoto ANO, Zenjo's legitimate son, and is designated as a historic relic of the city.
The Ano clan as a samurai family was taken over by the lineage of Tokimoto.
According to records, the lineage surely existed until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, however, the lineage was much less influential, compared with the Ashikaga clan, a branch family of the Minamoto clan, which lineage was the same Kawachi-Genji (Minamoto clan) as that of the Ano clan.
This was considerably attributable to the fact that Zenjo and Tokimoto were killed as rebels, and another fact that the Hojo clan was extraordinarily wary of the Ano clan because the Ano clan was the lineage of MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo which was closer to MINAMOTO no Yoritomo than that of the Ashikaga clan, which branched from several generations before Yoshitomo.
On the other hand, Zenjo's daughter married FUJIWARA no Kimisuke, a lineage of FUJIWARA no Uona of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and her son Sanenao ANO founded the Ano family as a court noble from his maternal surname.
Renshi ANO (阿野廉子), who was in Emperor Godaigo's favor and gave birth to Emperor Gomurakami, was a descendant of the Ano clan.
Misao TAMAMATSU, who played an active role in the end of Edo period, was also a descendant of the Ano family.
Dakiniten (written as 荼枳尼天 or 荼吉尼天 in kanji characters) is a Buddhist goddess.
The term 'Dakini' is the transliteration of the Sanskrit term dākinī (spelled Dakini in English).
Dakiniten derives from a goddess from India.
Dakiniten was originally a goddess of farming, but later came to be assumed to govern sexual desire and later came to be assumed to be a female fierce god eating human flesh or live human hearts.
In Hinduism, this goddess is assumed to be a dependent of Kali (a Hindu goddess).
This goddess was introduced into Buddhism, and it was supposed that she had been exorcised by Daikokuten (the god of Wealth), that is, the incarnation of Dainichi Nyorai (Cosmic Buddha), and then permitted to eat human hearts, if dead.
She is said to have unrestricted supernatural powers, knows the death of a person six months ahead, and takes and eats the person's heart.
Belief in Dakiniten in Japan
In the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, Dakiniten is located in the southern part of Gekongoin (the most peripheral section of the Womb World) of the Womb World (one of the two worlds in Esoteric Buddhism, representing Dainichi Nyorai's spirit of salvation having every possibility of generation as a womb, where a fetus grows), and this goddess is depicted as a small tengu (mountain spirit (portrayed as winged and having a long nose)) sitting astride a white fox; therefore, she is also called Shinkoo Bosatsu (Fox King).
There exist records showing that prayers were offered for Dakiniten at an Esoteric Buddhism ceremony performed on the occasion of an emperor's enthronement.
In addition, several persons including TAIRA no Kiyomori and Emperor Godaigo were known to have performed a method of Dakiniten in esoteric Buddhism, however, "Genpei Seisuiki" (The Rise and Decline of the Minamoto and Taira clans) states that TAIRA no Kiyomori discontinued this method.
This goddess is extraordinarily difficult to enshrine because it is supposed that any person is required, once this goddess is enshrined, to keep believing therein in exchange for his or her life until his or her last moment and also that should such a duty be neglected (in other words, should incantation to worship the deity be discontinued), such a person would immediately become ruined or meet with disaster.
Thus, Dakiniten was considered to be a non-Buddhist religion and belief in it tabooed.
Dakini was originally supposed to sit astride a jackal in India but the fox was substituted for the jackal in introduction to China and Japan (because jackals were not present in those countries).
In other words, an image of Dakiniten riding a fox (which has not existed in India) has not been depicted in Taizo Mandala (Womb Realm Mandala) or the orthodox scriptures or ritual manuals of Esoteric Buddhism and was created in medieval Japan and the like.
It is supposed that the creation of the above image resulted in Dakiniten coming to be syncretized with a Shintoist god, Inari (the fox god) in Japan.
In Japan, Dakiniten is believed to be a goddess of good fortune.
Belief in Dakini in later India
In later Esoteric Buddhism after the introduction to Japan, a sexual image was added to Dakini, which resulted her to be depicted as a naked goddess having a skull.
Tachikawa School (Esoteric Buddhism)
Dakiniten later came to be deemed as a goddess governing sexual love, which resulted in Tachikawa School of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism being gradually founded from the Kamakura period until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts and flourished in Japan.
It is supposed to enshrine Dakiniten, set a skull as a principle image and attain Buddhahood while still in the flesh by sexual intercourse as a rite.
For this reason, Tachikawa School was said to be regarded as a heresy and was finally exterminated in the Edo period.
However, it is still controversial as to whether the doctrines and rites of Tachikawa School mentioned above were true or not because the above theories are all based on documents written by those who regarded Tachikawa School as a heresy and oppressed it, and most of the documents written by devotees of Tachikawa School, which are vital for verification of the genuineness of those theories, were subjected to book burning and Tachikawa School was treated as a heresy against the backdrop of its involvement in the political power struggle between the Southern and Northern Dynasties.
The term Sanmon refers to a gate located in front of a temple.
Sanmon is assumed to represent Sangedatsumon (Three Gates of Liberation), which consists of three gates symbolizing three mental states, that is, kumon (gate symbolizing emptiness), musomon (gate symbolizing formlessness) and muganmon (gate symbolizing desirelessness), to pass through before reaching the Buddhist paradise.
From the viewpoint of architectural history, it is said that a main gate facing the south and two auxiliary gates facing the east and west, respectively, as provided for temples in ancient times, were called Sanmon.
In more recent years, temples were provided with a large outer gate accompanied by side gates on the left and right sides, and later, temples came to have a large outer gate only; however, it is assumed that such a large outer gate remained to be called Sanmon.
There are several theories as to the derivation of the term Sanmon, including the following: that the term symbolizes the gates one has to pass through in order to be delivered from the three evil passions of avarice, anger and stupidity; or that the term symbolizes the gates to the three paths to Buddhahood of Shomon (learning), Engaku (self-attained enlightenment) and Bosatsu (bodhisattva).
In some cases, Sanmon do not have a door.
It is said that this represents Buddha's deep compassion which does not deny the entry of sentient beings into the Buddhist priesthood.
Some temples have gates that are referred to using the Japanese kanji "三門" (pronounced "sanmon", the literal meaning of this term is "three gates") in addition to gates that are referred to using the Japanese kanji "山門" (also pronounced "sanmon", the literal meaning of this term is "mountain gates").

Suden (1569 - February 28, 1633) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect and a politician serving the Tokugawa shogunate from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the Edo period.
His father was Hidekazu ISSHIKI, who was a vassal of the Ashikaga Shogunal family.
He was also known as Ishin Suden or Konchiin Suden.
He was called a 'Prime Minister in Black Robes' (a Buddhist priest who rendered political service as if he were a prime minister).
Suden was born in Kyoto in 1569.
After his father's death, Suden studied Buddhism under Genpo Reisan at Nanzen-ji Temple, then inherited Buddhist doctrines from Tokurin SEISHUKU, the chief priest of Konchiin Subtemple of Nanzen-ji Temple, and thereafter further studied Buddhism at Sanboin Subtemple of Daigo-ji Temple.
Having served as chief priest of Fukugon-ji, Zenko-ji and Kencho-ji Temples, Suden became the 270th chief priest of Nanzen-ji Temple in 1605.
In 1608, Suden was invited to Sunpu by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, who located the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in Edo by superseding the Toyotomi government, and served as a diplomatic secretary in place of last Jotai SAISHO.
After a while, he came to have involvement in shogunal administration.
Engaged in administration concerning Buddhist temple and Shinto shrine affairs together with Genkitsu KANSHITSU and Katsushige ITAKURA, he was involved in projects, including the prohibition of the Christian religion, as well as the establishment of Jiin shohatto (the Acts for the Buddhist Temples), Buke shohatto (the Acts for the Military Houses) where the basic policies of the bakufu were laid out, and Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto (a set of regulations that applied to the emperor and the Kyoto nobles).
He was also involved in the Incident of Hoko-ji Temple Bell which triggered the Siege of Osaka, a battle against Toyotomi family).
After the death of Ieyasu in 1616, he had a dispute with Tenkai concerning the shingo (literally, "shrine name"), which is the title given to a Shinto shrine.
Suden insisted on deifying Ieyasu under the name of Myojin (a gracious god) while Tenkai insisted on deifying him under the name of Gongen (meaning the incarnation of a god), which was adopted eventually.
In 1618, Suden raised Konchin Temple (Minato-ku Ward, Tokyo Prefecture) in Edo.
In the following year, 1619, he assumed the position of Soroku (highest-ranking priest of the Gozan, the leader of the Zen sect).
Thereafter, the position of soroku of Konchiin Subtemple was succeeded by the priests who inherited the Buddhist doctrines directly from Suden.
Suden administered the affairs of the bakufu, moving between Nanzen-ji Temple (Konchiin Subtemple) and Konchiin Temple in Edo, and both he and Tenkai were called Prime Minister in Black Robes.
In addition, Suden strived for the reconstruction and restoration of Nanzen-ji Temple and Kencho-ji Temple, and also undertook literary activities, such as the collection and publication of ancient books.
Suden intended to punish Soho TAKUAN, Sohaku GYOKUSHITSU and Sogan KOGETSU, who presented written objection to the tough measures taken by the bakufu with the Shie Incident in 1627, by exiling them to a distant island.
However, through the intervention of Tenkai and Munenori YAGYU, Takuan and Gyokushitu were exiled to Kaminoyama in Dewa Province and Tanagura in Mutsu Province, respectively, and Kogetsu was subjected to no punishment.
On February 28, 1633, Suden passed away at the age of 64.
He left behind the following literary works: "Honko Kokushi Nikki" (journal; the term "Honko Kokushi" is a portion of his posthumous title); "Honko Kokushi Goroku" (collection of sayings); "Ikoku Nikki" (journal concerning diplomatic affairs).
It is said that people gave him the nickname, 'Daiyokuzan Kikonin Senjo-ji Akukokushii,' which implicates his greediness, powerfulness, obtrusiveness and unpopularity, because he was very powerful and used political techniques that seem somewhat strong in the Incident of Hoko-ji Temple Bell and so forth.
The term kaidan (ordination platform) is a Buddhist term that refers to a place for giving the precepts of Buddhism.
Kaidan is a place where a person who intends to become a Buddhist priest or priestess is given the precepts of Buddhism, the bounds of which are kept fixed.
Such a person needs to be given the precepts of Buddhism to be duly authorized as a Buddhist priest or priestess.
History
Buddhism was introduced into Japan in 538, and the precepts introduced at that time were imperfect.
In those days, Buddhist priests were exempted from taxation, and therefore there were many people who took the tonsure but did not enter the Buddhist priesthood (illegally ordained priests) to evade taxes.
In other words, there were many corrupt priests who did not even train themselves in Buddhist ascetic practices.
In response to this situation, Jianzhen was invited from Tang to introduce the precepts of Buddhism.
Thereafter, only persons who could observe those precepts were authorized as Buddhist priests.
Consequently, disciplines came to be observed in Buddhist society.
Jianzhen had kaidan built at Todai-ji Temple in 754, and gave the precepts of Buddhism to 430 people including the Emperor Shomu in April of the same year.
This is the oldest kaidan.
Thereafter, Jianzhen had a building to house Kaidanin at Todai-ji Temple, and had kaidan at Kanzeon-ji Temple in Dazaifu in Tsukushi Province and Yakushi-ji Temple in Shimotsuke Province (present Shimotsuke City, Tochigi Prefecture) (Three Major Kaidan in Japan).
Since then, it has been mandatory to be given the precepts of Buddhism at one of the three kaidan mentioned above and have kaicho (a certificate to that effect) issued, and priests have been under the supervision of the State (provincial monastery).
After the death of Saicho in 822, however, Imperial sanction for the construction of kaidan at Enryaku-ji Temple was given, and kaidan was built there.
This is called Daijo kaidan (a Mahayana ordination platform) in some cases.
In those days, the Buddhist society in China did not approve the Daijo kaidan at Enryaku-ji Temple, and the priests who had been given the precepts of Buddhism at that temple were not recognized as priests in China.
In addition, Todai-ji Temple and other temples in Nanto (Nara) had antipathy toward the sanction for the construction of kaidan at Enryaku-ji Temple, which was not kanji (state-sponsored temples).
This became one of the causes of the conflict between Enryaku-ji Temple and temples in Nanto.
The Daijo kaidan also caused power struggles, among which one between Sanmon (referring to Enryaku-ji Temple) and Jimon (referring to Onjo-ji Temple) of the Tendai Sect is well-known.
In addition, among the priests who had been given the precepts of Buddhism at kaidan, more of them did not even train themselves in Buddhist ascetic practices and corrupted.
Eison, in the Kamakura period, was originally belonged to the Shingon Sect, but later learned the doctrines of the Ritsu Sect introduced by Jianzhen to found the Shingon Ritsu Sect by combining the doctrines of both sects.
He criticized the three major kaidan and the one at Enryaku-ji Temple for being no longer what they should be and being unworthy as a place to give the precepts of Buddhism, and advocated that the giving of the Buddhist precepts be effected by fixing the bounds of a sacred place to give those precepts in conformity with the precepts and performing a rite in accordance with proper procedure.
He gave the Buddhist precepts at Todai-ji Temple in person again in collaboration with other like-minded priests, and also founded an original kaidan at Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).
Following this, Enkan, who had served as a priest at Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei, left there to place an original kaidan.
Thereafter, in the Kamakura New Buddhism, which was founded as a result of the conflict with temples in Nanto and Enryaku-ji Temple, original rites for entrance into the Buddhist priesthood and giving the precepts of Buddhism came to be performed.
On the other hand, the kaidan at Todai-ji and Enryaku-ji Temples were respected as time-honored ones, and the precepts of Buddhism were given there until the end of the Edo period.
Shinkei (1406 - May 29, 1475) was a Buddhist priest of the Tendai Sect and also a renga poet (linked-verse poet) in the middle of the Muromachi period.
He was also called Renkai, Shinkei (using a different set of Chinese characters, 心恵), or Shinkyo.
He was born in Kii Province.
He entered the priesthood when he was still young and trained himself on Mt. Hiei.
He lived at the Butchiin of Onjo-ji Temple when he was 44 or 45 years old, assumed the position of the chief priest of Jujushinin Temple near Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto, became Gon Daisozu (Associate grade of Daisojo (the highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests)), and then he was finally appointed to Hoin (the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests).
While he studied under another Buddhist priest called Shotetsu and was known as a poet of the Reizei School, he gradually became a renga poet of the time by for example attending the 'Kitano-sha manku' (10,000 linked verses event at Kitano-jinja Shrine) in 1433.
Based on the Shinkon style (tone of poems seen in "New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese poetry") learned from Shotetsu, Shinkei's work was unique in the way that he placed the importance on close examination of poem subjects and self-preoccupation in poem themes, exhibiting his refined senses in his 'hieyasetaru' (simple and natural) poem style.
According to his renga theory, waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) and renga training, and Buddhism training were ultimately the same thing, and this theory was emphasized in his important work called "Sasamegoto" (Murmurings) as well as other works such as "Oinokurigoto" (Old man's prattle), and "Hitorigoto" (Solitary ramblings) (1468), and also influenced next-generation renga poets such as Sogi and Kensai INAWASHIRO and a master of tea ceremony Juko MURATA who practiced wabicha (literally, "poverty tea style"; known as the tea ceremony).
Avoiding wars, he spent the later stages of his life in Kanto and died at the age of 70.
While he compiled rengashu (renga collections) and kashu (poem collections) such as "Shingyokushu" (New gems collection) and "Shinkei Sozu Juttai Waka" (Priest Shinkei's Waka in Ten Style), he was also one of the renga shichiken (seven sages of renga) whose poems were included in "Chikurinsho" (Bamboo Grove Notes) compiled by Sogi.
"Shinsen Tsukubashu" (the newly-selected Tsukubashu) included the largest number of his poems.
INGEN Ryuki (December 7, 1592 – May 19, 1673) was a Chinese Zen Buddhist priest in the periods of the late Ming Dynasty and the early Qing Dynasty, who was born in Fuqing, Fuzhou of Fujian Province, China; his secular family name was Hayashi (林), and his imperially bestowed titles in Japan were Shinku daishi (daishi: a great teacher monk) and Kako daishi; and he was given special posthumous Buddhist names, Daiko-fusho kokushi (kokushi: a posthumous Buddhist title given by the Emperor), Butsuji-kokan kokushi, Kinzan-shushutsu kokushi, and Kakusho-enmyo kokushi.
He introduced Zen Buddhism of the Ming Dynasty that was characterized by nenbutsu-zen (Zen training with Buddhist invocation) to Japan, and keeping his unique solemn manner, he made a great impact on the Zen Buddhism world at that time to give large stimulation to the recovery movement of the Rinzai Sect and the Soto Sect, along with Dosha Chogen (unknown – 1660: he came to Japan in 1651, and returned to China in 1658) who had come to Japan little earlier than him.
He is also said to have been a founder of Senchado (green tea ceremony) in Japan.
He was born at Manango-reitokuri-torin (万安郷霊得里東林), Fuqing, Fuzhou of Fujian Province, China.
His secular name was Sohei LIN (林曽炳).
Although he was awakened to Buddhism when he was ten years old (some say sixteen), his mother would not allow him to become a priest.
When he was twenty-three he visited Chondoshu (潮音洞主) in Mt. Putuo (Zhejiang Province), where he served as a non-priest devotee.
At twenty-nine, he entered the Buddhist priesthood under KANGEN Koju at Manpuku-ji Temple on Mt. Obaku of Fuqing (Fujian Province, China), which was an old temple at his birth place and once a residence of OBAKU Kiun (or Huangbo Xiyun in Chinese) (黄檗希運).
At thirty-three, he practiced Zen under MITSUN Engo (Also known as Mi-yun Yuan-wu, 密雲円悟), a Zen priest, at Vang-un ghoul-un juu Temple on Mt. Jinsushan, and later Ingen followed Mistun who took up a new position as chief priest at Manpuku-ji Temple.
At thirty-five, he became enlightened.
When Ingen was thirty-eight, Mitsun gave his position over to his disciple HIIN Tsuyo and left the temple, but Ingen stayed at Manpuku-ji Temple to inherit the dharma from Hiin at forty-five.
Later, when Ingen was engaged himself in ascetic practices at Shishiiwa (獅子巌) after leaving Manpuku-ji Temple, he was invited to become a juji (a resident head of a temple) on Mt. Obaku succeeding Hiin, where he assumed the position in 1637.
Later he once left the Temple, but took the position again in 1646, when the social upheavals in the transition period from the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty spread to Fujian Province.
In the early Edo period, as a juji position became vacant at Sofuku-ji Temple (Nagasaki City) that was a temple of Chinese priests, ITSUNEN Shoyu (逸然性融) who was in Japan and juji of Kofuku-ji Temple (Nagasaki City) invited Ingen to Japan.
At first Ingen sent his disciple YARAN Shokei (也嬾性圭) off, but he was killed in a shipwreck on his way to Japan, so Ingen had to bring himself to Japan aboard a ship Seiko TEI (鄭成功) prepared with many disciples in tow in 1654.
Although he is said to have come to Japan to avoid the social turmoil that China experienced in the transition period between the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, this judgment has no grounds in remaining letters and records.
A number of intelligent monks and scholars were attracted by Ingen's high virtue and the new Zen Buddhism of Ming to gather around Kofuku-ji Temple where Ingen first lived, and the temple is said to have been very active and was flocked to by several thousand monks and believers.
In 1655, RYOKEI Shosen, juji of Myoshin-ji Temple, persuaded Ingen to become juji of Fumon-ji Temple in Shimagami, Settsu Province (present Takatsuki City of Osaka Prefecture), but the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) forbid him to go out of the temple and also restricted the number of attendants at the meetings in the temple to within 200, because the bakufu feared Ingen's religious influence.
Although he decided to return to China after the three years which he at first promised to stay for, responding to the repeated requests of his home country to go home, Ryukei and other priests worked hard to detain him from going home and set up a meeting between Ingen and Ietsuna TOKUGAWA, the Shogun, successfully in 1658.
Consequently, in 1660, he was given land for a temple at Owada of Uji-gun, Yamashiro Province, and the next year he built a new temple which he named Manpuku-ji Temple on Mt. Obaku after the temple of his home Fuqing as he pledged to remember the old people and things.
In 1663, he held an opening ceremony at the newly completed hall to bless the country and conducted Japan's first Jukai (handing down the precepts) called 'Obaku Sandan kaie' (Triple Ordination Platform Ceremony) for people.
Obakuzan Manpuku-ji Temple in Fuqing of China has been called 'Ko-obaku' (literally, Old Obaku) ever since in Japan.
This made Ingen a founder of a sect of Zen Buddhism in Japan, but initially, the sect did not call itself Obaku Sect.
Since he was proud of himself as a successor of authentic Rinzai Sect, the sect called itself Rinzaisei Sect.
However, since its tradition and Kiku (regulation) and Shingi (daily regulations in Zen temples) at the monastery followed the Rinzai Zen Buddhism of the Ming Dynasty in China, it was somewhat different from the Rinzai Sect that had already taken root in Japan, and the difference led it to form a new sect.
Ingen's "Obaku-shingi" (Obaku code of conduct) had a great impact on the rehabilitation of religious code of conduct of Japanese Zen sects which began to be lapsed at that time, and the book was viewed as a valued model for the religious reform movement of Soto Sect led by Dohaku MANZAN.
Emperor Gomizunoo, the Imperial family members, senior officials of the bakufu, rural feudal lords, and many merchants became believers of the Obaku Sect of Ingen.
He occupied the position of resident head priest of Manpuku-ji Temple for three years, and gave the position to his disciple MOKUAN Shoto to retire in Shoin-do hall in October, 1664.
After retiring in Shoin-do hall, at eighty-two years old in February, 1673, he began putting his affairs in order in contemplation of his death, his health deteriorated rapidly in April, and he was given 'Daiko-fusho kokushi,' a posthumous Buddhist name, by Emperor Gomizunoo on May 18.
On the following day, May 19, he put down yuige (poem for teachings to disciples and posterity written by a dying venerable priest) before entering nirvana (he passed away).
He was eighty-two years old.
He was also well-known as a great calligrapher, one of the best three calligraphers of Obaku, along with MOKUAN Shoto and Sokuhinyoitsu.
"Ingen-zenji-goroku" (Analects of Ingen), sixteen volumes
"Fusho-kokushi koroku" (Analects of Ingen), thirty volumes
"Obaku Ingen Zenji Untoshu" (Collection of Ingen's Poem) one volume
"Gukaihogi" (disciplines and precepts), one volume
"Obakusan-jishi" (History of Manpuku-ji on Mt. Obaku), one volume
"Obaku-shingi" (Obaku code of conduct)
The number of teaching successors to Ingen was twenty-three including three Japanese priests.
MOKUAN Shoto
Sokuhinyoitsu
ERIN Shoki
RYOKEI Shosen (the former chief priest of Myosin-ji Temple)
DOKUTAN Shokei
DAIBI Shozen
Dokusho Shoen
DOKUHON Shogen
Ingen-mame,' which was named after Ingen who brought to Japan, is a farm product of a pea family native to Latin America.
After it was introduced to Europe, it traveled across the Eurasian Continent to China and then was imported to Japan.
However, some views explain that Ingen's bean was 'fuji-mame' (hyacinth-bean) as we know them today, and people call fuji-mame 'Ingen-mame' in the Kansai region (around Kyoto and Osaka Prefectures).
Maitreya Bodhisattva in manas in a semi-lotus position came to Japan when Miroku (Maitreya) worship was imported from China in the sixth through the seventh centuries, and many statues created in the Asuka and Nara period still remain in Japan.
One of the most famous Maitreya statues is 'Maitreya with berretta' (the first natural treasure) kept in the Reiho-den of Koryu-ji Temple in Uzumasa, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, and it is known for his posture in which he is lost in thought with the right ring finger on his cheek.
As the statue was made of pine, which is unique for the statues created in the Asuka period, there has been a theory that the statue came from the Kingdom of Silla in 623 as written in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).
Gold leaves were originally attached to the statue surface with lacquer.
The smile of Maitreya Bodhisattva is known as an 'archaic smile.'
Statue height: 123.3 cm (measured from the feet; height from the pedestal: approximately 147 cm)
Major Work Examples
Maitreya with berretta: at the Reiho-den of Koryu-ji Temple in Uzumasa, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture; woodcraft
Crying Maitreya: at the Reiho-den of Koryu-ji Temple in Uzumasa, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture; woodcraft

Kancho (916 - July 13, 998) was a Buddhist monk of the Shingon Sect in the middle of the Heian period.
His father was Imperial Prince Atsumi, who was a son of Emperor Uda.
He was also one of the leading figures in Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) composition.
Since he was the chief priest of Hensho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) by Sarusawa-ike Pond in the Hirosawa area outside the capital city of Kyoto, he was called 'Sarusawa no Sojo (priest),' 'Hirosawa Sojo,' or 'Hensho-ji Sojo.'
He entered the priesthood under the guidance of his grandfather Cloistered Emperor Uda, and Kanku carried out kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) for him.
He was appointed to betto (superior) of Ninna-ji Temple, betto of Sai-ji Temple, betto of To-ji Temple, gon-risshi (fifteenth-ranked Buddhist priest of the Shingon Sect, literally meaning "supernumerary master of discipline"), homu (Director of temple affairs) of To-ji Temple, and To-ji choja (chief abbot of To-ji Temple), and in 986, he became the Shingon Sect's top and Japan's third highest-ranked Buddhist priest.
Meanwhile, he served as a preceptor when Emperor Enyu received religious precepts.
On December 2, 989, he established Hensho-ji Temple by Hirosawa-ko Lake under the order from Emperor Enyu.
FUJIWARA no Sanesuke's diary called Shoyuki contained an entry about the memorial service at the time of temple establishment, describing a large number of Kugyo (top court officials) such as Cloistered Emperor Enyu attending the service.
He had extensive knowledge in practical training and logical study of doctrines of Esoteric Buddhism and wrote 'Kongokai-shidai' (writings about Vajradhatu) and 'Fudo-shidai' (writings about Fudo).
He was also familiar with chants and so made tone adjustments for 'Rishu-kyo' (Principle of Wisdom Sutra); therefore, he was considered the originator of the restoration of Tomitsu (eastern esotericism) shomyo (chant).
When TAIRA no Masakado started a rebellion in the Kanto area, Kancho went there to pray.
There, Kancho prayed to Fudo Myoo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings), and later, Shinsho-ji Temple on Mt. Narita, famous for having 'Narita Fudo Temple,' was built with Fudo Myoo as the honzon (principal image of Buddha).
Sanbo-ekotoba is a collection of Buddhist tales compiled in the middle of the Heian period.
It is also called Sanbo-E for short.
It was completed in December 984 during the reign of Emperor Enyu.
Tales were selected by the scholar MINAMOTO no Tamenori (? - 1011) and dedicated to Imperial Princess Sonshi (966 - 985) of nihon (the second court rank).
As decided by fortune-telling, Imperial Princess Sonshi became Sai-in (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Kamo-jinja Shrines) of her father, Emperor Reizei, when she was three years old, and later married her uncle, Emperor Enyu, after her father resigned as Emperor; however, she had her hair cut in secret and entered the priesthood in May 982.
Afterwards, three volumes of 'Sanbo-ekotoba' were offered to the Imperial Princess as introduction to the priesthood.
According to the annotation, these books originally had illustrations, but they were excluded over time and only text-based tales remain.
Sanbo refers to Buddhist images (such as Buddha), laws (Buddhist scriptures), and monks, and the books describe their kudoku (merits).
13 tales in the first volume are about Shakyamuni's good deeds in a previous life.
18 tales in the second volume are biographies of high-rank monks of that imperial reign and 17 of them have been cited from "Nihon Ryoiki" (Miraculous Stories from the Japanese Buddhist Tradition, written in the early Heian period).
The third volume describes the history and manners of annual Buddhist services (masses) for each month.
These three volumes supposedly correspond to 'a long time ago,' 'in the middle,' and 'now.'
Existing books may be written in hiragana, Japanized Chinese, or in a combination of Chinese characters and katakana characters.
Compilations of these various texts have been published by Gendaishicho-sha and The Toyo Bunko (Oriental Library) of Heibon-sha.
Some of the writing has been believed to be MINAMOTO no Toshiyori's calligraphic works.
The drawing style is refined, neat, and elegant.
The postscript reads 'copying completed on July 11, 1120.'
In Juo-shinko, the faithful beg for the mercy of ten judges, who decide the realm to which the dead would go posthumously.
The faithful worship the Juo (ten judges) while alive, aiming to have their wrong doings pardoned posthumously.
The Juo were regarded as an awesome existence because they decided whether the dead should be sent to Jigoku (Hell, one of the posthumous realms advocated by Buddhism) and presided over the Rokudo-rinne (transmigration in the six posthumous realms advocated by Buddhism) in light of the seriousness of the karma belonging to the dead person.
In general, this belief tends to be seen as a belief in Enma (one of the Juo).
This tendency originates from the low name recognition of judges except for Enma.
Summary
While Buddhism was fused with Chinese Taoism after being introduced to China, a pseudepigrapha "Enra-o-juki Shishu Gyakushu Shoshichiojo Jodo-kyo Sutra" (Sutra of Jizo and the Ten Kings) (Also known as "Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra" for short) was composed, with the result that the Juo-shinko was established at the end of the Tang period.
There are also sutra among Taoism Sutra such as "Genshitenson-setsu-hoto-metsuzai-kyo Sutra" (元始天尊説鄷都滅罪経, sutra of salvation at the hell by Genshi Tenson (Primeval Lord of Heaven, the highest god in Taoism)), "Chifu-juo Batsudogi" (地府十王抜度儀, scripture about salvation by Ten kings in Chifu (Earth Palace)) and "Taijo-kyukutenson-setsu-shoken-metsuzai-kyo Sutra" (太上救苦天尊説消愆滅罪経, sutra of salvation by Taijo Kyuku tenson (most honorable gods)), which explain the Juo by the same name and in the same order as "Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra."
"Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra" remarkably differs from ordinary Buddhist scriptures translated into Chinese in the way that it has a description of 'Seitofu Daiseiji-ji Shamon Zosen Jutsu' (described by Zosen, a Shamon priest of Daiseiji-ji Temple in Chengdu) at the beginning of the book.
As shown in the term, Buddhist scriptures translated into Chinese, it is obvious in the translated scriptures that the description at its beginning should be written as 'OO代翻経三蔵△△訳' (OO Sutra translated by Sanzo (venerable priest with profound knowledge of sutra) △△) as a rule, even if it is a pseudepigrapha.
Only 'Juo-kyo Sutra' (sutra for Juo-shinko), however, neglects this custom.
This is the peculiar character of 'Juo-kyo Sutra' and its peer.
Because there is a similar description at the beginning of "Jizo juo-kyo Sutra," described later, as well, which is believed to have been composed in Japan.
Therefore, it had long been misunderstood that it was composed in China.
The similarity observed at the beginning of "Jizo juo-kyo Sutra," however, supposedly originates from the author's plot to give authority to his sutra through copying the writing style of "Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra."
The reason why "Jizo juo-kyo Sutra" is not arranged in the style of translated sutra is presumably in its background that the original sutra was initially composed as an article for Raisan (worship the Buddha) or a rule book without adopting the style of sutra.
"Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra" preaches a blessing given through two Buddhist ceremonies, Seishichisai (生七斎) and Shichishichisai (七七斎).
As Seishichisai was a ceremony in which living people pray for their posthumous peace, the term 'Yoshu' (預修) or 'Gyakushu' (逆修) was used.
It is believed that the main pillar of the original 'Juo-kyo Sutra' was Seishichisai.
In the ceremony of Seishichisai, Buddhist mortuary tablets of Juo were enshrined with paper and brush put in front of them to offer an opinion to Tenso (celestial gods), Chifu (gods of Earth and other realms), Myokan (officers of Hell) through the Juo.
Artificial horses for sending paper were also displayed.
On the other hand, Shichishichisai was a ceremony held by a bereaved family as a memorial service for praying for peace for the dead and accumulating good deeds.
After combining these two ceremonies, the main pillar of the 'Juo-kyo Sutra' was gradually shifted to the Shichishichisai.
However, it preached that six sevenths of good deeds brought through Eko (Buddhist memorial service, prayers for the repose of the soul) are allocated to living people, while one seventh is to the dead.
These allocations are preached not only in "Yoshu Juo Shoshichi-kyo Sutra" but also in "Kanjozuiganojojippo-jodo-kyo Sutra" (Also known as "Kanjo-kyo Sutra" (sutra of Kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor)) for short) and "Jizo bosatsu hongan-kyo Sutra" (The Sutra of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha's Fundamental Vows).
"Jizo Bosatsu Hossin Innen Juo-kyo Sutra" ("Jizo Juo-kyo Sutra" (a late Heian-period Japanese sutra (based on a Chinese counterpart) dealing with Jizo Bosatsu and the Ten Kings of Hell) for short) was composed in Japan, spreading throughout the nation along with Mappo-shiso (the "end of the world" belief) and Meikai-shiso (belief that there is a posthumous realm) in the Heian period.
"Jizo Juo-kyo Sutra" includes many elements which suggest this sutra was composed in Japan, for example, the appearance of the Sanzu-no-kawa River (river, the dead cross) and Datsueba (witch staying Sanzu-no-kawa River to rob the dead of their clothes), the description of a bird twittering '別都頓宜寿' (Hototogisu) and Japanese-tasted sentences.
The spread of Meikai-shiso supposedly originated from the accomplishment of Ojoyoshu (The Essentials of Salvation) compiled by Genshin.
Each Juo was correlated with each Buddha in the Kamakura period, thereafter the number of Buddha increased gradually to create the Jusanbutsu-shinko belief (Thirteen Buddha belief) in the Edo period.
Transition of the Takai-kan (idea of "the world after death")
The quantity of information on takai (the world after death) has increased dramatically in Japan due to the introduction of the Juo-shinko.
While the old takai-kan suggested that takai was the undefined world such as yominokuni (Hades) shown in Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters) as well as the dim world which people would go after their death, the new takai-kan defined takai in detail, influenced by Taoism and Confucianism, therefore it imposed a heavy responsibility on each person because the new takai included Jigoku (hell) where people were tormented.
As the takai-kan was stressed at the time when Mappo-shiso gained popularity, the takai-kan of Buddhism was quite naturally accepted nationwide for its definite information about takai, Jigoku.
Although most takai-kan advocated in Japan came from China, there are some differences between the two.
The differences include the Sanzu-no-kawa River, SAI no KAWARA (the Children's Limbo), Datsueba and Keneo (wizard staying in the Sanzu-no-kawa River to plunder the clothes of the dead).
Trials by the Juo
The number of trials for each dead person is usually decided to be seven.
After the death, trials are held every seven days under the charge of seven individual judges; Shinko-o (first judge for trial held on the 7th day after the death), Shoko-o (second judge for trial on the 14th day), Sotei-o (third judge for trial on the 21st day), Gokan-o (fourth judge for trial on the 28th day), Enma-o (fifth judge for trial on the 35th day), Henjo-o (sixth judge for trial on the 42nd day), Taizan-o (seventh judge for trial on the 49th day).
When a certain judge concluded that the trial has no problem, the trial would be closed without being reported to the next judge, allowing the dead person to reincarnate, so trials are not always held seven times.
It is also decided how to deal with the trials in which seven judges could not find the instructions.
Three additional trials are prepared under the additional three judges; Byodo-o (eighth judge for trial held on the 100th day after the death), Toshi-o (ninth judge for trial in the first anniversary), Godotenrin-o (tenth judge for trial held in the second anniversary).
Even if seven judges could not find the instructions after seven trials, they instruct the dead person to go to one of the Rokudo (six posthumous realms) after those trials, therefore additional trials are effectively the relief measures.
Additional trials work as the following; even if the dead person had gone to the San-akudo (three realms where people are tormented for their malevolent acts conducted while they were alive) of Jigoku-do (Hell), Gaki-do (torment of starvation) and Chikusho-do (ordered to live as animals), they are pardoned, while when the dead person had been in Asura-do (pandemonium), Jin-do (the realm human beings live) or Ten-do (the realm celestial beings live), their virtues are added.
Buddhist memorial services were customarily held seven times every seven days, because the bereaved family could pray to the Juo for seeking commutation for the dead person at every trial, while additional memorial services held in line with the additional three trials supposedly functioned to save all dead persons.
This custom, however, has been simplified at present, and a Buddhist memorial service 49 days after a person's death is commonly the first service held after Tsuya (all-night vigil over a body), the final service and a memorial service on the sixth day after person's death.
While these are the descriptions about the Juo, there are three more additional trials in the Jusanbutsu-shinko belief.
(the sixth anniversary, the twelfth anniversary and the 32nd anniversary of a person's death)

Shinzui KIKEI (1401 - September 25, 1469) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect of Buddhism and also master of Inryoken Household in Rokuonin Temple in the Muromachi period.
He was also called Shinzui INRYOKEN.
He was of Uezuki clan lineage, which was a branch family of the Akamatsu clan in Harima Province, but his parents are uncertain.
He studied under Soban SHUKUEI of Unchoin Temple.
He assumed the position of the master of Inryoken Household in Rokuonin of Shokoku-ji Temple, which was a liaison with shogun, being a close retainer serving the shogun.
He once retired from the political world after the Kakitsu War in which Mitsusuke AKAMATSU and others murdered the sixth Shogun Yoshinori ASHIKAGA in 1441, nevertheless later becoming a political adviser along with Sadachika ISE and others in the period of the eighth Shogun Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, he exerted influence on the shogunate government.
After Tomiko HINO, the wife of Shogun Yoshimasa, had a son (Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA), he not only plotted to out Yoshimi ASHIKAGA, Yoshimasa's younger brother, to whom Yoshimasa had promised that he would hand over the shogunate, but also interfered in the succession dispute in the Shiba clan, one of the three Kanrei (family in the post of shogunal deputy to the Muromachi Shogunate), but he fell from power along with Sadachika and others in the Bunsho Coup caused by the opposition such as Katsumoto HOSOKAWA in 1466.
He took sanctuary in Omi Province when the Onin War started in 1467.
He was appraised negatively in historical material such as "Oninki" (The Record of the Onin War).
He wrote a part of "Inryoken Nichiroku" (Inryoken's Diary), an official diary.
Ojoyoshu is a Buddhism book in one part and three volumes compiled in 985 by Genshin (priest), a Sozu (the Prelate) in Eshinin Temple at Yokawa on Mt. Hiei, in which he collected important passages relating to gokuraku ojo (the Pure Land of Amitabha where the dead are allowed to live peacefully), extracting from many sources such as Buddhist scriptures and instructions in terms of the Jodo Sect.
He laid the foundation of the Jodo Sect by preaching that there is no other way but praying to Amitabha wholeheartedly to be granted the gokuraku ojo posthumously.
The spirits of onri-edo (abhorring this impure world) and gongu-jodo (seeking rebirth in the Pure Land) preached in this book also spread among the nobility and common people, having a big influence on literary thought later.
As shown in the last passage, soon after this book had been compiled, SHU Buntoku, a lay Buddhist in Taizhou Prefecture Northern Song, went to Kokusei-ji Temple on Mt. Tendai with this book to be respected by many monks and seculars in China, with the result that this book contributed to the resurrection of the Buddhism doctrine in China, which had been scattered and lost due to the confusion at the end of the Tang and Wudai Shiguo period after the persecution of Buddhists in the Huichang era.
The First Volume
The first chapter (onri-edo) describes the abhorrence of this impure world and preaches the Rokudo (six posthumous realms) of Hell, preta realm, animal realm, Asura realm, Human realm and blissful realm.
The second chapter (gongu-jodo) is about seeking rebirth in the Pure Land, explaining ten kinds of pleasure obtained in the Pure Land of Amitabha.
The third chapter (Gokuraku-shoko) describes the justice of "gokuraku ojo".
The fourth chapter (Shoshu nenbutsu) encourages practicing correct Buddhist invocation and suggests the path leading to the jodo ojo (the pure land of Amitabha).
The Second Volume
The fifth chapter (Jonenhoho) explains the methodology of Buddhist invocation and ascetic practices.
The sixth chapter (Betsuji Nenbutsu) is about the Buddhist invocation prayed at person's death.
The Third Volume
The seventh chapter (nenbutsu riyaku(benefit)) explains the blessings given by intoning the Buddhist invocation.
The eighth chapter (nenbutsu shoko) describes the merits of intoning the Buddhist invocation.
The ninth chapter (Ojo-shogyo) explains the tolerance of Amitabha.
The tenth chapter (Mondo Ryoken) describes the excellence of the Buddhist invocation through exchanging questions and answers.

Kanjo is a ceremony mainly celebrated in Esoteric Buddhism, in which a legitimate successor is declared by pouring water over the top of the head.
It originated as a ceremony that celebrated enthronement of the kind or investiture of the Crown Prince in India, which used to be called Tenjiku.
Examples includes Kanbutsu-e, which is a ceremony that commemorates Buddha's birthday; Esoteric Buddhism complicated the ceremony.
There are a variety of ceremonies that are used on different occasions.
In Japan, it is believed that Saicho conducted the first Kanjo at Jingo-ji Temple at Mt. Takao in 805 (Saicho received the teachings of Himitsu (secret) kanjo from Jungyo at Ryuko-ji Temple when he visited Tang, and later received Kanjo in Kongokai (Diamond Realm) and Taizokai (Womb Realm) that were brought from Kukai.
The types of Kanjo are described below.
Kechien-kanjo
In this type of Kanjo, a person who enters priesthood chooses his or her guardian deity.
It features Toke Tokubutsu, in which a blindfolded new initiate throws a flower onto mandala to choose his or her tutelary god depending on where the flower lands; the new initiate connects with the god.
The mandala includes Kijin (fierce god) and rakshasa (type of evil spirit) but new initiates learn how to worship and celebrate those gods in case they select them.
Kukai conducted the ceremony three times; his flowers always fell on Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana).
Jumyo-kanjo
It is conducted for people who are determined to practice and learn profound Esoteric Buddhism.
Unlike Kechien-kanjo, which is an introductory ceremony that connects people with gods, Jumyo-kanjo is a ceremony that certifies disciples; it is also known as Deshi (disciple) kanjo.
Denpo-kanjo, Kintai-ryobu denpo-kanjo
In this type of Kanjo, the title of Ajari (a master in Esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) is given.
Only the priests who have completed an Esoteric Buddhism practice called shidokegyo (four trainings) are entitled to the ceremony.
In the ceremony, priests receive esoteric points of Esoteric Buddhism and are permitted to have disciples.
Priests are allowed to teach their disciples by using Buddhist scriptures as well as oral instruction and the Buddha's intention and they are also allowed to officially begin a new school and a new sect.
It is also known as Ajari-kanjo or Jushoku-kanjo.
Japan used to conduct 'Sokui-Kanjo' to celebrate enthronement of the emperor between the Kamakura period and the end of Edo period.
According to the record, Gotobain and Gofukakusain also received Kanjo.
Gessho (1813 - December 20, 1858) was a Sonno Joi (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians) School Buddhist monk who lived at the end of the Edo period.
He went by the aliases Sokyu, Ninkai, Ningai and Hisamaru.
He was born in 1813 as the eldest son of an Osaka physician.
In 1827, he entered the Joju-in sub-temple of Kiyomizu-dera Temple under the influence of his uncle Zokai.
He went on to become the head priest of Joju-in Temple in 1835.
However, his commitment to the Sonno Joi philosophy and connections to the court nobles of Kyoto led him to side with the Hitotsubashi family during Iesada TOKUGAWA's conflict surrounding the shogun's successor, causing him to be viewed as a threat by Tairo (great elder) Naosuke II.
He was a close friend of Takamori SAIGO and persuaded him from taking his own life after the sudden death of Nariakira SHIMAZU who Takamori greatly respected.
During the Ansei Purge which began in August of 1858, he became a wanted man as Naosuke viewed him as a dangerous member of the Sonno Joi School, leading him to flee Kyoto with Takamori.
He escaped to the Satsuma Domain but the domain, which considered him to be a burden, declined to provide protection and ordered that he be sent to Hyuga Province.
This was essentially the casting of him over the border between the Satsuma Province and the neighboring Hyuga Province.
These events led Gessho to make the decision to take his own life, and he and Takamori attempted to drown themselves in Kinko-wan Bay.
Gessho died but Takamori miraculously survived.
Gessho was aged only 46 at the time.
There was also another Buddhist monk by the name of Gessho.
Okimi no tame ni ha nanika oshikaramuSatsuma no seto ni mi ha shizumu tomoEnglishOf what should I have regrets if it is for Thee?Even if I should sink in the narrow straits of Satsuma?
Ganami (? - June 23, 1486) was a priest of Ji Sect in the Muromachi period.
Although he came from a fisherman's family in Etchu Province, he entered a religious order of Ji Sect after realizing the retribution over killing animals, and devoted himself to social work as a kanjin-hijiri (priest who collects donated money for social work).
Ganami rebuilt the Gojo-ohashi Bridge, which had been washed away, using the donated money from the rich and also restored the Buddhist sanctum in Nanzen-ji Temple.
He was a famous kanjin-hijiri in Kyoto.
In an unveiling of the principle image at Hase-dera Temple in 1459, he carried the Emperor's command granting Imperial permission to Kofuku-ji Temple.
The nation was hit by the Kansho Famine from 1460 to 1461, which was caused by disturbances due to the internal troubles of the Hatakeyama clan in addition to a poor harvest because of abnormal weather, as well as an epidemic.
In Kyoto alone, as many as 82,000 of people starved to death, with the result that Kamo-gawa River presented a horrible spectacle by being filled up with corpses.
Giving 100 kanmon ("kanmon" is a monetary unit of old times, 100 kanmon is about one million yen at present) to Ganami, Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA ordered him to give food out of charity to starving people on January 22, 1461.
Ganami also raised contributions from people in Kyoto and established a hut in the south of Rokkakudo Hall (Choho-ji Temple), starting to give millet porridge to starving people from February of the same year.
However, the number of starving people was so huge that he had no other option but to stop giving food about a month later due to depletion of funds.
After the Onin war, Ganami made efforts to collect money for the reconstruction of Kiyomizu-dera Temple, which had been burnt down in the war, by visiting various districts nationwide, and in turn, Kiyomizu-dera Temple Main Hall was reconstructed in 1484.
He was called 'JOJUIN Gana' as a person who had done meritorious service for the reconstruction of the temple.
Ganami died of illness two years later on May 13, 1486.
Nisshin (1407 - October 30, 1488) was a priest of the Nichiren Sect in the Muromachi period.
His father was Shigetsugu HANIYA.
He is believed to have been the first advocate of 'Fuju-fuse-gi' (nothing could be received or given).
He was born in Shimosa Province.
He learned from the younger biological brother of his father, Nichiei (Nakayamamon School), at Myosen-ji Temple, and entered Nakayama Hokekyo-ji Temple.
He went to the capital in 1427, and conducted missionary work in various places including Kamakura and Kyoto.
He went to Hizen Province in 1433.
He revisited the capital in the same year to found Honpo-ji Temple (Kyoto City).
Nisshin, who made various temples convert to the Nichiren Sect, advocated almsgiving of other sects when he had the opportunity to preach to the sixth Shogun, Yoshinori ASHIKAGA, and as a result, he was forbidden to propose to the government.
He broke the ban and was incarcerated; Honmyo-ji Temple was destroyed.
He was nicknamed 'pan-wearing shonin' and 'pan-wearing Nisshin' based on the legend that he was tortured by a burning pan being placed on his head but he did not stop preaching
He was released after Yoshinori was killed in the Kakitsu War in 1441 and was incarcerated again when he was ordered to come to Kyoto by the eighth Shogun, Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.
Honmyo-ji Temple was rebuilt with support from a machi-shu (merchant class) named Kiyonobu HONAMI in 1463.
He died in 1488, at age 82.
Nichiren's pure worship of Hoke-kyo (Lotus Sutra) gradually changed as the wars continued during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) and other sects expanded their influence during the Muromachi period; he compromised with other sects and did not hesitate to receive charity from believers of other sects.
In particular, Nakayamamon School represented by Nakayama Hokekyo-ji Temple was believed to be relatively tolerant of other sects from the beginning.
According to the records, Rissho ankoku ron (the Treatise for Spreading Peace Throughout the Country by Establishing the True Teaching), which was the temple's treasure, had been lent out to Kamakura Fuon-ji Temple (no longer exists) of the Ritsu Sect to transcribe in 1336.
Amid the situation, Nisshin advocated Fujufuse-gi.
Nisshin began street preaching at Ichijo Modori-bashi Bridge in Kyoto (1427), however, other sects, including Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei and the Rinzai Sect, embraced by the shogunate family severely oppressed his activities.
To save the chaotic society by Hoke-kyo, Nisshin wrote 'Rissho jikoku ron' (the Treatise on Establishing the True Teaching and Governing the Country) in an attempt to convert the Ashikaga shogunate family to the Nichiren Sect (during this era, restless days continued as the peasants' uprising of the Shocho era and the rebellion of the Gonancho (Second Southern Court) force occurred) and was incarcerated for the attempted direct appeal (1440).
He was tortured; his head was covered with a red-hot pan.
According to the legend, the pan never left his head for the rest of his life.

Chogen (1121 - 19 July, 1206) was a Buddhist monk from the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period.
His priest title was Shunjobo.
As the Daikanjin (chief fundraiser) of Todai-ji Temple, he restored the temple after it was destroyed by fire in the Jisho-Juei War.
Chogen was born into the Ki clan as the son of KI no Sueshige.
In 1133, he entered the Buddhist priesthood aged 13 years at Daigo-ji Temple of the Shingon Sect.
He later studied under Jodo (Pure Land) Sect founder Honen.
He also practiced in various places including Shikoku and Kumano.
It is said that he visited China (Southern Song Dynasty) on three occasions (although there are other theories).
The majority of Todai-ji Temple was destroyed during TAIRA no Shigehira's Siege of Nara.
The daibutsuden (Great Buddha Hall) burned for a several days, and the Great Buddha statue (Birushana) suffered heavy fire damage.
The restoration of Todai-ji Temple was hampered by many financial and technical problems but in 1881 after Chogen came to inspect the damage, he made a proposal for the temple's restoration to Emperor Goshirakawa's messenger FUJIWARA no Yukitaka, who agreed and appointed him Todai-ji Temple Daikanjin.
Chogen was aged 61 years at the time.
It was permitted that the taxes collected in Suo Province could be used to cover the reconstruction costs of Todai-ji Temple but Chogen personally assembled and organized fundraising monks, civil engineers and artists as well as soliciting donations to raise the funds required to rebuild the temple before proceeding with reconstruction work.
Chogen also personally requested donations from individuals including Emperor Goshirakawa and FUJIWARA no Kanezane in Kyoto and MINAMOTO no Yoritomo in Kamakura.
It is said that Chogen himself also studied architecture and civil engineering in China, and he guided the construction workers with the cooperation of Chinese engineer CHEN Heqing.
He is said to have developed a method of transporting large trees from the mountains to Nara.
In addition, he built bessho (remote religious facilities separate from a main temple) in Iga Province, Kii Province, Suo Province, Bicchu Province, Harima Province and Settsu Province from which he conducted religious and construction activities.
He faced several challenges along the way.
The greatest of these was the issue of what to rebuild after the reconstruction of Great Buddha Hall, and Chogen was faced with a difficult situation in which his wish to build a sub-temple was opposed to the opinion of the monks who had lost their living quarters.
During the reconstruction of Todai-ji Temple, Chogen charged Saigyo with soliciting donations in the form of gold dust in the Ou region (Mutsu Province and Dewa Province).
It was the overcoming of these many difficulties as well as the work of Chogen and all of those working under him that resulted in the reconstruction of Todai-ji Temple.
A ceremony to consecrate the new Great Buddha statue was held on 30 September 1185, the Great Buddha Hall was rebuilt in 1195, and a joint ceremony was conducted in 1203.
The sutra hall of Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto was also constructed in 1195 by Chogen but was destroyed by fire in 1939.
These meritorious deeds led to Chogen being granted the title Daiosho (great preceptor).
Following Chogen's death, Eisai, known as the founder of the Rinzai Sect in Japan, took over the position of Todai-ji Temple Daikanjin.
The Shunjo-do Hall at Todai-ji Temple is dedicated to Chogen and houses the 'Seated Statue of Priest Chogen' (National Treasure).
This Kamakura period sculpture is renowned as a masterpiece for its striking realism.
Statues of Priest Chogen remain at Jodo-ji Temple (Ono City) (bessho of Harima Province), Shindaibutsu-ji Temple (bessho of Iga Province) and Amida-ji Temple (Hofu City) (Suo bessho).
Chogen wrote "Namuamidabutsu-sazenshu" (book about Chogen's works) around 1203.
It is said to be due to the influence of Chogen that the posthumous Buddhist name Amidabutsu (Amida Buddha) came to be used today.
The Great Buddha Hall reconstructed by Chogen was once again burnt to the ground by Hisahide MATSUNAGA in his conflict with the miyoshi sanninshu (three chief retainers of the Miyoshi clan) in 1567 during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
The current Great Buddha Hall was rebuilt during the Hoei era in the Edo period (1704 - 1711).
Structures dating from the time of Chogen that remain standing at the modern Todai-ji Temple consist of Nandai-mon (great south gate), the Kaisan-do (Founder's hall) and the Hokke-do Rei-do (ceremony hall).
The Jodo-do hall (Ono City, Hyogo Prefecture) at Jodo-ji Temple (Ono City) which was built at Harima bessho in 1197 remains standing today and has been designated a National Treasure.
This architectural style used in the Great Buddha Hall rebuilt by Chogen as well as in other buildings is highly distinctive and was once called 'Tenjiku-yo' (lit. Indian style) but this was misleading as it has no connection to India, so is therefore now referred to as 'Daibutsu-yo' (lit. Great Buddha style).
It is said to be related to the style used in Fujian Province during Song Dynasty of China.
According to the history of Japanese architecture, China was highly influential during the Asuka period the Tenpyo period (729 - 749) period, but Japan went on to develop its own style during the Heian period before China once again came to exert an influence on the country.
Structurally, the style incorporates a horizontal beam known as a nuki (penetrating tie beam), which is used in combination with pillars to reinforce the structure.
Decorations called kurigata (a molding) are also used on the ends of the nuki.
The Matsunoo-dera Temple hotokemai (Buddhist dance) is a religious ritual conducted at Matsunoo-dera Temple (Maizuru City) in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It has been designated an Important Intangible Cultural Property and is performed for the public on May 8 very year.
Hotokemai is a dance performed wearing masks representing Dainichi Nyorai, Shaka Nyorai and Amida Nyorai to Etenraku music that is reputed to have been transmitted from Tang Dynasty China during the Nara period.
The origin and beginnings of the Hotokemai are unknown as Ancient Matsunoo-dera Temple records were lost to fire but records remain stating that the ritual was already being performed by the early Edo period.
Mincho KITSUSAN (1352 - 5 October,1431) was an artist monk during the early and middle Muromachi period.
He was born in Awaji Province (present Hyogo Prefecture).
He entered Tofuku-ji Temple of the Rinzai Sect where he studied the painting style of Daido Ichii.
The monks with whom he associated wished to make him a high ranking Zen monk but his passion was painting, so he refused this in order to study art under LI Longmian of Ming Dynasty China, and went on to find success as the first temple artist.
The 4th shogun, Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, was extremely fond of his style.
He held the Buddhist monk rank of Densu (responsible for managing the Buddha hall) for his entire life, so is known as Cho Densu.
He passed away in 1431.
Tofuku-ji Temple possesses many of his celebrated works including "Shoichi Kokushi zo" (Portrait of Shoichi Kokushi), "Yonjuhachi So zo" (Forty Eight Founders), "Kanzan Juttoku zu" (Image of Hanshan and Shide) and "Juroku Rakan zu" (Image of the Sixteen Arhats).
The Hokke Sect of Honmon School is a denomination of Nichiren Buddhism for which the sect founder is considered to be Nichiren and the school founder is believed to be Nichiryu.

Summary
Nichiryu (Hokke Sect of Honmon School founder) studied under Nissai of Myoken-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) but had a dispute regarding Hokke-kyo (the Lotus Sutra), which caused him to advocate 'Happon Shoi ron' (theory that eight chapters of Hokke-kyo (Lotus Sutra) are the true teachings of Nichiren), leave Myoken-ji Temple and establish Honno-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) where he founded the Nichiryumon School.
History
1415: Nichiryu established Honno-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture)
1872: The Nichiryumon School united with all other schools in the Nichiren denomination as a result of a system in which each sect was allowed only one chief abbot.
1874: Nichiryumon School become part of the Shoretsu School of the Nichiren Sect.
1876: The Nichiryumon School called themselves the Happon School and separated from the Shoretsu School of the Nichiren Sect.
1898: The Happon School was renamed to the Honmon Hokke Sect.
1941: The Honmon Hokke Sect and Honmyo Hokke Sect combined to form the Hokke Sect.
1951: Kocho-ji Temple (Shizuoka Prefecture), Jusen-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), Honno-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) and Honko-ji Temple (Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture) became independent from the Hokke Sect and formed the Honmon School of Hokke Sect.
Benzaiten is one of the deva guardian gods in Buddhism.
It is the name given to the Hindu goddess Saraswati when she was incorporated into Buddhism and Shinto.
The kanji (Chinese characters) representation based on sutras is '弁才天,' but in Japan the character 'zai' (才) can also be written as a character meaning money (財), and this led the goddess to become worshipped as a goddess of wealth and expressed as '弁財天.'
Benzaiten was originally a Buddhist god but is considered a Shinto god in Japan.
She is also known as Benten, and is one of the Seven Gods of Fortune.
In Buddhism, she is considered to be the same god as Myon-bosatsu (Bodhisattva of music).
Temple halls that have Benzaiten as their principal image are given names such a Benten-do, Benten-sha.
The original name 'Saraswati' is the Sanskrit name of a sacred river.
She was originally a river goddess in ancient India but became a music goddess due to the association with the sound of flowing water, and is broadly worshipped as a goddess of fortune as well as arts and sciences.
Representations of the goddess are generally classified into those with two arms and those with eight arms.
The eight armed representation is derived from the 'Daibenzaitennyo-hon' (chapter 15) teaching of the "Konko Myosai Sho-kyo" (Golden Light of the Most Victorious Kings Sutra), and the eight hands hold objects including a bow, arrow, hoko (long-handled Chinese spear), kanawa (iron ring) and lasso.
The two armed representation depicting the goddess playing a biwa (Japanese flute) can be seen in the Womb Realm Mandala of the Mandala of the Two Realms used in Esoteric Buddhism.
However, the two armed image seen in the Womb Realm Mandala is not the goddess image that became widely worshipped in Japan but the bodhisattva form.
Worship of Benzaiten had already begun by the Nara period, and the eight armed standing statue (modeled statue) housed in the Hokke-do hall (Sangatsu-do Hall) of Todai-ji Temple is highly valuable as Japan's oldest such work despite extensive damage.
Heian period representations of Benzaiten are almost unheard of, and Kamakura period works are extremely rare.
The Benzaiten statue (two armed seated statue) at Shirakumo-jinja Shrine in Kyoto is unique as it is the same bodhisattva form playing a biwa that can be seen in the Womb Realm Mandala.
This statue is said to have been worshipped by biwa expert Daijo daijin (Chancellor of the Realm) FUJIWARA no Moronaga, and has an early Kamakura period style, and is considered to be the oldest two armed Benzaiten statue in Japan.
Other statues known to date from the same period consist of that at Koki-ji Temple in Kanan-cho, Osaka Prefecture (two armed seated statue) and that at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine in Kamakura (two armed seated statue) which is inscribed with the year 1266.
There are many examples of early modern statues depicting Benzaiten as both the eight armed seated form and two armed form playing the biwa.
In the middle ages, worship of Benzaiten syncretized with the Shinto and indigenous Japanese water god Ichikishimahime no Mikoto (or the Munataka Sanjojin (three goddess enshrined at Munakata-jinja Shrine) and Ugajin (unknown descent.
Both native Japanese and imported gods.)
to became commonly enshrined in Shinto shrines.
In the early modern period, Benzaiten became considered one of the so called 'Seven Gods of Fortune' and was syncretized with Ugajin, the god of agriculture and cereals and many images were made depicting her as Ugajin (an elderly form with the head of a human and the body of a serpent).
Due to her original role as an Indian river goddess, she is often enshrined in places deeply connected to the water such as watersides, islands and ponds.
Enoshima-jinja Shrine in Kanagawa Prefecture (now enshrining the Munataka Sanjojin), Hogon-ji Temple in Chikubu Island, Shiga Prefecture and Daigan-ji Temple (Hatsukaichi City) on Itsukushima Island are referred to as 'The Three Great Benzaiten of Japan,' and all face the sea or a lake (there are different opinions that claim other temples and shrines comprise the 'The Three Great Benzaiten of Japan').
Tenkawa-jinja Shrine in Nara Prefecture originally enshrined Benzaiten but it is well known that the shrine now enshrines her as Ichikishimahime no Mikoto.
Sites enshrining Benzaiten were built throughout Japan as the worship of Benzaiten spread, but many of these strongly Shinto Benten-sha halls became Shinto shrines as a result of the separation of Buddhism and Shinto during the Meiji period.
In addition, it became common to write the 'zai' (才) character of Benzaiten using a character meaning money (財), and she came to be worshipped as a goddess of wealth and expressed as '弁財天.'
Zeniarai Benten Shrine in Kamakura (now officially named Ugafuku-jinja Shrine) is a typical example of this phenomenon as it is believed that washing money in the spring within the cave in the shrine precinct will cause many times the amount to come to the bearer.
As described above, worship of Benzaiten since the early modern period has taken on a complicated form in which Buddhism, Shinto and folk beliefs have merged.
The kanji representation of the name 'Saraswati' is 'Benzaiten' (辯才天) but, for the reasons stated above, the 'zai' (才) character is also written using the character meaning money (辨財天).
Two characters of ben '辯' and '辨' are pronounced the same but have different meanings, so 'benzai' could mean either 'eloquence' (in speech and ability) or 'the accumulation of wealth' depending on the characters used.
After the war, the toyo kanji (kanji for general use) reform meant that the two traditional ben '辯' and '辨' characters were replaced by a single simplified character '弁' that is now generally used to write the name Benzaiten '弁才天' or '弁財天.'

Hojoe is a religious ritual in which captive animals are released into the wild to admonish against the taking of life.
Buddhism is based on the precept 'forbidding the taking of life,' and this was adopted by Shinto as a result of the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism in Japan.
The ritual encompasses harvest festivals and thanksgiving festivals, and is conducted in spring and autumn in Buddhist temples and Hachimanshin (God of War) throughout Japan.
Particularly the Hojoe (Also known in Fukuoka as 'Hojo-ya') held at Hakozaki-gu Shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture is counted as one of the three great festivals of Hakata, and those conducted by Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine in Kyoto City and Usa-jingu Shrine in Oita Prefecture are known as major events that draw large numbers of tourists.
Origin
In Rusui choja (sresthin "Flowing Water") chapter of the "Konkomyo-kyo Sutra" (Golden Light Sutra), there is a Jataka tale (Buddhist Tale) that tells how when Sakyamuni Buddha's previous incarnation, Rusui choja, helped countless fish that faced death when a large lake dried up and released them to safety, the fish were reincarnated into the Heaven of the Thirty-three Celestials and repaid Rusui choja for his kindness.
The "Bonmo-kyo" (Sutra of Brahma's Net) also contains this narrative and origin.
Hojoe as a Buddhist ritual is believed to have began with Chinese Tendai Sect founder Zhiyi who, in light of the story of Rusui choja was saddened by the sight of fishermen discarding small fish, sold his possessions to buy these fish and set them free.
In addition, the passage 'Release life on lunar New Year's Day to show your gratitude' in 'Liezi' (Taoism book) is the basis of conducting Hojoe at Buddhist temples.
The practice in Shinto began in 676 when Emperor Tenmu issued a decree for the release of caged animals, and came to be carried out at times of natural disaster and during religious festivals.
The first Hojoe ritual is thought to have been that held at Usa-jingu Shrine in 720 as a reparation for the deeds that took the lives of numerous soldiers in the conflicts up to that time (it is written in the history of Usa-jingu Shrine that this was conducted as a ritual to repose the souls of the Hayato people who were massacred by the Yamato Sovereignty during the subjugation of Kyushu).
The ritual was first conducted at Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine in 863, and became an event attended by an imperial envoy in 948.
The use of the Buddhist deity name Hachiman Daibosatsu was prohibited by the Meiji government in 1868 as a result of the separation of Buddhism and Shinto, leading Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine and Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine to conduct Mid-autumn festivals instead of Hojoe.
Hojoe Throughout Japan
Buddhism
Kofuku-ji Temple
Held every April 17th.
Animals are released into Sarusawa-no-ike Pond at the south of the temple.
Kofuku-ji Temple also participates in the Hojoe of Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine but the spring ritual of the temple and the autumn ritual of the shrine are remnants from the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism.
Hosho-ji Temple (Shinjuku-ku Ward, Tokyo Prefecture)
The name of Hosho-ji Temple (Shinjuku-ku Ward, Tokyo Prefecture) in Waseda, Tokyo, consists of the 'Hojo' characters of Hojoe.
It is said that the temple was given the temple's name 'Hosho-ji' by Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, 3rd Tokugawa Shogun, in 1649 as it had been deeply revered by the Tokugawa shogun family since the time of its founding.
(the hollyhock crest of the Tokugawa family was also permitted to be used as the temple crest)
The Hojoe ceremony is said to have been conducted at the temple since the time of its founding.
A 'Hojo Kuyo Hoyo' is held every year on Health and Sports Day, which is the ritual event that fish are released into the pond within the precinct in order to give thanks to the animals that are eaten on a daily basis.
It is often said that services for pets are conducted at Hosho-ji Temple (Shinjuku-ku Ward, Tokyo Prefecture) but this is not true.
Shinto
Usa-jingu Shrine
Formally held on August 15 of the old calendar but is now held over three days ending with Health and Sports Day (from Saturday to Monday).
The name of the ceremony has been changed to 'Chushu-sai' (Mid-autumn Festival) but is referred to as 'Hojoe' by all involved with the exceptions of the media and tourists.
The ceremony at this shrine is thought to be the origin of the Hojoe in Shinto but is unique in several ways.
The animals released during the Hojoe are Terebralia palustris snails (whereas ordinarily fish and birds are used for a more dramatic effect).
Several shrines in Northern Kyushu come together to participate in the procession, with the holy bronze mirror in which the god is thought to reside being offered by Komiya Hachiman-gu Shrine.
The event coincides with the 'Rinji Chokushi Hoei-sai' (the festival of provisional hohei (offering a wand with hemp and paper streamers to a Shinto god) by Imperial envoy) once every ten years.
The next ceremony will take place in 2015.
Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine
Held every September 15 as part of the Iwashimizu Festival.
The Hojoe at the shrine dates from roughly the same period when the Hachimanshin was transferred from Usa-jingu Shrine, and became an event attended by an imperial envoy in 948 as well as being one of the most important annual festivals in Kyoto.
Although it was prohibited as a result of the separation of Buddhism and Shinto during the Meiji period, it carries on as the Iwashimizu Festival but many of the traditions have been lost.
After an absence of 137 years, the "Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine Hojo Taikai" was revived in 2004 by volunteers in its original joint Buddhist and Shinto form, and is conducted in a fashion reminiscent of ancient Hojoe.
Hakozaki-gu Shrine
Held from September 12 -18 every year and is one of the three great festivals of Hakata.
It is thought of as a typically autumn festival as some say 'pears and persimmons are sold at hojoe.'
Other Information
Hojoe served as entertainment for the masses during the Edo period, and it was recorded that the number of visitors who assembled for Hojoe at Tomioka Hachiman-gu Shrine was so great that their weight caused the Eidai-bashi bridge to collapse in 1807.
Zasu
A term of Buddhism, a different name of a chief priest.
Generally speaking, it refers to the title of representative priests of the Tendai Sect.
A term of the history of the law system, an examiner in Kakyo (Chinese higher civil service examinations)
Zasu in Buddhism term generally refers to the top priest of the Japanese Tendai Sect, Tendai-zasu (chief abbot).
While this term originally referred to priests or chief priests who had the ability to unite many priests, later it came to mean the top priests in the Enryaku-ji Temple, which required the approval from the Imperial court in order to control all of the Tendai Sect.
It seems that mainly the Imperial family assumed the position after the Kamakura period.
After Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism) in the Meiji period, approval from the Imperial Court was no longer necessary and the term was used as the title of the chief priest in Tendai Sect temples.
It is used, not only in Enryaku-ji Temple, but also in Kongobu-ji Temple, Daigo-ji Temple, Hossho-ji Temple, Gankei-ji Temple, and so on.
Zasu refers to an examiner in Kakyo, Chinese higher civil service examinations.
After the examinations, a successful applicant visited the examiners to show his gratitude for allowing him to pass the examinations and they made a contract as teacher and student.
At that time, the examiner was called 'zasu,' meaning the master of that place.
Such relationships did not seem problematic from the viewpoint of a relationship between a successful Kakyo applicant and the examiner in charge, however, they produced bureaucratic alliances, which created a breeding ground for the development of factions.
So, the denshi (palace examination as the final step of scholarly career in China) system was created in the Baisong period in order to abolish these negative effects.
The theory was that if the ultimate examiner was the Emperor, zasu being the Emperor, the Emperor and each Kakyo bureaucrat already had the teacher-student relationship, irrelevant of bureaucratic parties.
Nichiyo (1556 - January 1, 1641, Japan) was a Shingon Sect priest in the Edo period.
His secular surname was Onodera, connected to the Mochizuki clan in Bushu (Musashi Province).
He shaved his head to become a priest at the age of fifteen and went to Mt. Negoro, Kishu Province to learn to be a priest by pursuing his studies.
He went to Mt. Koya to escape from Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's attacks on Negoro in 1585, and later assumed the position of the chief priest at Saikoin Temple in his homeland, Monma-mura Village, Musashi Province (present-day Miyashiro-machi, Minami Saitama-gun, Saitama Prefecture).
After a while he was taught by Senyo Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) at Hase-dera Temple in Nara, and became absorbed in the secrets of the Shingon Sect by Genyu Sojo at Chishakuin Temple.
He was favored and valued highly by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and was appointed as the third noge (master) of Chishakuin Temple by the order of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in December, 1612.
After that time, he was deeply trusted by Ieyasu and Hidetada TOKUGAWA and additionally was given a temple estate 300 koku (approximately, 54 cubic meters) as a reward for his prayers for victory in the Siege of Osaka.
He was also granted Shoun-zenji Temple, which was built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and established the foundation of Chizan (School) as Chishakuin in Negoro-ji Temple on Mt. Ihobuttcho.
He was appointed as gon no sojo (a high ranking priest, next to a sojo) in August, 1617, retired from the position of noge in the winter of 1631, and passed away in January 1, 1641 at the age of 85.
Shukyu BANRI (October 26, 1428 - ?) was a Zen priest and kajin (waka poet) in the Muromachi period.
He was from the Hayami clan in Omi Province.
He was born in Omi Province.
He became a priest at Yomeiin, Tofuku-ji Temple of the Rinzai Sect in Kyoto, conducted ascetic practices at Unchoin of Shokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, and studied under Daikei Sokai.
He also attended lectures given at Kennin-ji Temple and Nanzen-ji Temple and studied under Shinzui KIKEI of Inryoken Household.
When Shokoku-ji Temple was burned down in the Onin war, which started in 1467, Shukyu left the capital for Omi and then other places.
He returned to secular life in the country and, in 1471, moved to Mino Province, where he formed a companionship with Myochin SAITO.
Then, Shukyu moved to Owari Province and Mikawa Province and in 1485 he was invited to stay at Edo-jo Castle by Dokan OTA.
After Dokan was assassinated by Sadamasa UESUGI in 1486, Shukyu was forced by Sadamasa to stay at Edo-jo Castle for a while.
However, later Shukyu visited Dokan's son, Sukeyasu OTA, who was purged from the castle by Sadamasa.
His literary works included "Joshokenki" (literally, records at Joshoken Keep), "Anthology Baika Mujinzo," a collection of Chinese poems about his travels to Togoku (seven volumes and it is said to have been completed in 1506).
Shobo (832 - July 30, 909) was a Shingon Sect priest in the early Heian period.
He was the founder of the mountaineering asceticism of Tozan School.
His secular name was Prince Tsunekage.
He was a sixth generation-descendent of the Emperor Tenchi and his father was Prince Kadona.
His shigo (a posthumous name) was Rigen Daishi.
He studied under Shinga, Kukai's biological brother.
Shobo studied the doctrine of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism (Shingon Sect), traveling to Nanto (southern capital (Nara)) to study the doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism (Sanron Sect, Hosso Sect and Kegon Sect).
While his mentor, Shinga had importance for intercommunion with aristocratic society, Shobo kept himself detached from the society.
He was known to live a clean life and have a faultless and doubtless character.
The differences even suggested that there was a conflict between Shinga and himself.
Shobo's following activities were thought to form a marked contrast to Shinga's behavior: Shobo conducted mountain ascetic practices on Mt. Kinpu in Yoshino, and, by adoring EN no Gyoja (A semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the 7 century) in his heart, revived the mountaineering asceticism training in Mt. Omine, which was thought to have been abandoned after the disappearance of EN no Gyoja.
Shobo received Jumyo Kanjo (a water rite to be a disciple) and Muryoju-ho (teachings of Sutra of Immeasurable Life) from Shinga.
After his mentor's death, he climbed up Mt. Koya at the age of 49, and received a secret art of both the vajra (the Diamond Realm) and garbha (the Womb Realm) mandalas from Shinzen, Shinga's disciple.
He received denpo-kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma) from Gennin of Nanchiin of To-ji Temple at the age of 53, was given the position of Ajari (a master in Esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) to became the head of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism succeeding Kukai at the age of 56.
Shobo founded Daigo-ji Temple in Yamashina, Kyoto (present day, Yamashina, Fushimi-ku Ward).
He also made a base of San-lun (Three Shastras) Teachings by establishing Tonanin Temple in Todai-ji Temple, which should not be overlooked by the two following viewpoints; Shobo's high evaluation of Chugan (Intermediate) or Hannya-ku (the truth that nothing is substantial, void, taught in the Heart Sutra) and Kukai's adjusting ceremonies to Shingon Esoteric Buddhism at major temples at Nanto.
Shingon Esoteric Buddhism itself developed based on the doctrine of the Kegon-kyo (Avatamsaka Sutra).
In other words, from the fact that the Kegon (a thought of virtues are correctly provided due to trainings and performing acts of charity) doctrine was placed not as the eighth (Tendai Hokke) but as the ninth Jushin (stages of Mind Development) in Himitsu Mandala Jujushinron (Ten Abiding Stages on the Secret Mandalas), Juju taimo (endlessly interconnected net of Indra) (unobstructed) of Sokushin Jobutsu gi (Principle of Attaining Buddhahood with the Present Body) can be thought to have developed into a theoretical foundation of practical code based on the philosophy which symbolized the Kegon doctrine of Ichi-soku-ta and Ta-soku-ichi (one is equal to many, many to one).
It is very meaningful that Vairocana, who had been considered a silent existence, described as "this world is Buddha's body (rokudai),"declared that he, himself would preach.
In Esoteric Buddhism faith, which puts strong emphasis on measures, moving from theory to practice should be approved from the viewpoint of Mahayana Buddhism prosperity.
It should be interpreted that because of the idea, Shobo, recognizing that he was in a direct line of Kukai, the founder, promoted activities at Todai-ji Temple.
It should be noted that Mandala, itself, is based on the Kegon-kyo doctrine, "the integral of Fugen Bosatsu's trainings."
Shobo served as betto (steward) of Kegon Sect of Todai-ji Temple and To-ji choja (the chief abbot of To-ji Temple), and so on, and studied both Exoteric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism.
Ningai, the founder of the Ono School of Tomitsu (Shingon Sect's esoteric teaching), established Mandala-ji Temple at Ono, Yamashina and founded the base for Esoteric Buddhism's practice, and Kancho, younger than Yakushin, who received the kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) from Emperor Uda at Omuro-Ninna-ji Temple, founded the Hirosawa School of Tomitsu and established Hensho-ji Temple along the shores of Hirosawa-no-ike Pond, and others are thought to have been successors in practical training and contrasted with Shobo, however, it should be interpreted that Shobo as well as the Hirosawa School of Yakushin made important foundations in Shingon-ji Saho Bunryu (branch schools in manners of Shingon Sect), which was later called Yataku Sanjuroku-ryu (thirty-six schools of yataku (Ono School and Hirosawa School)).
It was recorded that Shobo admired both Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion) and Juntei Kannon, ran rites and festivals for them at Mt. Kasatori, also known as Kami Daigo, and prayed for the births of the Emperors Suzaku and Murakami.
The belief was also traditionally maintained that Nyoirin Kannon was the incarnation of Seiryo Gongen (A protective god associated with the Chinese temple Ch'ing-lung), who accompanied Kukai when he came back to Japan.
Kangen, the first zasu (head priest) of Daigo-ji Temple, was considered to be Shobo's legal child, who accompanied by Junyu, his disciple, dedicated Kobo Daishi-go title to Oku no in (inner sanctuary) on Mt. Koya, and intended for the prosperity of the post-Kukai Shingon organization.
Shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) in Tozan School, which Shobo was founded, is thought to demonstrate profound preaching by Dainichi Nyorai with Funi Ichijo (most important of the Shingon principles which states to climb the mountain of Ichijo (truth), Mt. Omine, and pray for obtaining the body of funi (a thought that Ri (the innate reason) and Chi (knowledge) are non-two)), which was expressed through "Shugen Ein So Mandala" (literally, mandala of Shugendo under the teaching of Ein (Dainichi Nyorai's most secret teachings)).
Generally speaking, it is known that the preaching of Dainichi Nyorai should be developed and grasped through both the vajra (the Diamond Realm) and garbha (the Womb Realm) mandalas, whether in so-called "dai (Great Mandala) (hoshin (Buddhism's highest form of existence) Dainichi), san (sanmaya mandala) (imitsu (mystery of mind)), ho (Buddhist Law Mandala) (kumitsu (esoteric speech)), katsu (katsuma mandala (action mandala)) (shinmitsu (bodily mystery))" panorama, which are related with Ri and Chi of Esoteric Buddhism world, or in both a pluralistic perspective including rokudai (six great elements; that is Dainichi Nyorai) (tai (body)), shiman (four mandala) (so (match)), sanmitsu (three mysteries) (yu (function)), and a general perspective of Juju taimo (unobstructed) (Sokushin Jobutsu gi), but in the viewpoint of mountaineering asceticism, the Japanese animistic belief in holy spirit, it should be noted that Shobo, at this time, exhibited the Ri and the Chi in a monastic way.
This happened before the parallel mode of expression, "Kongokai (Diamond Realm) or Taizokai (Womb Realm)," became remarkable after Kakuban Kokyo Daishi in the latter Heian period, and should be understood as an epoch, regarding the religious beliefs particular to the Japanese, in conducting and discussing each master's standpoint or background related with Nini-Funi (also known as Funi-Nini (two sides of the same coin)) in which Oei no Taisei (Perfection in Oei era) reached the summit, more over in the Japanese intellectual history of Esoteric Buddhism, especially practicing or considering Jikyo niso (Jiso (method to practice the doctrine) and Kyoso (logical study of doctrines)).
The term, "Jisshu Jissho" (Discipline to prove the teaching) left by Shobo, should be the mind of mountaineering asceticism and always maintained by practitioners of Tozan School in the process of practice.
"Saisho Ein Sanma Yaho" (Dainichi Nyorai's most secret teachings) (Ein Kanjo (the ceremony to be the successor of a ritual of the Ein School))," the base for practice, was the realization of "Richi funi Kai Kai Raisan" (worship of the Shingon conceptual world with the nonduality of knowledge and principle) and it is said that it was given not only to Kangen, his legal child, but also to Teisu at Hokaku-ji Temple, Shingonin, Yamato tosu.
Ein Ho (ritual) of Tozan School is also called Bujuho (practice on the mountain) School because of Rei sojo (initiation in an unseen and wondrous method) by Ryuju Bosatsu and is sometimes contrasted with Buchuho (practice on the mountains) School of Honzan School, however, it can be said that the main point common in both schools is to put the priority on practice; practitioners of austerity completely give up any meaningless discussion based on worldly words and thoughts; they only concentrate on practice in mountains or in training halls near which people live.
This is connected with following the teaching of Ryuju Bosatsu, the master of Chukan School of Mahayana Buddhism, who tried to reach directly the truth of Hannya-ku through mystic instinct.
The practice of prayer directed to pure bodhisattva's spiritual awakening which is opened by Richi funi Raisan is done in order that the prayer recognizes that he or she is in a direct line of Shingon's third founder, Naagaarjuna (Ryuju), and at the same time, the practice is connected to the belief in and assurance of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, which exists so as that its believers try to realize rishu (the Principle of the Perfection of Wisdom) of bettoku (Distinguished virtue) Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, which all are made from Dainichi Nyorai as Fumon Sotoku (all virtues of Universal Gateway).
Nichia (? - March 10, 1407) was the seventh head priest of Taiseki-ji Temple.
His date of birth is unknown.
Biography
On June 4, 1406, due to the death of the sixth high priest Nichiji, Nichia became the seventh high priest of the temple.
He died on March 10, 1407.
Legend
Not many details are known about Priest Nichia, however, one theory is that he was not a Buddhist priest but a nyudo (lay-monk).
According to the 17th high priest, Nissei, in his 'Fujimonke-chukenmon,' he says 'According to legend, Nichia was a representative for the high priest and was not formally a high priest, however I (Nissei) believe that he was a proper high priest.'
Furthermore, according to the 31st high priest Nichiin in 'Record of Priest Nichiu,' because the 6th high priest Nichiji died without transmitting the teachings to a successor, Nichia temporarily assumed succession.
Then, Nichia found a priest (the 8th Priest Nichei) suitable for transmitting the teachings at Yoho-ji Temple in Kyoto, however Nichia also died before Nichei arrived.
At this time, Nichia entrusted the transmission to the lay priest Yuzuno Jonen and it is said that Yuzuno Jonen was affiliated with Priest Nichei.
Nichiin (1518 - August 16, 1589) was the 13th head priest of Taiseki-ji Temple.

Butsudan is a permanent miniature temple in an ordinary house to enshrine Buddha as well as an alter to enshrine the dead of the family.
Its inside is designed as a gorgeous simulation of the Buddhist hall of the head temple of each relevant Buddhist sect, where statues of Buddha and ihai (ancestral tablets) are installed.
Butsudan is classified into three main types, i.e. kin butsudan (golden alters), karaki butsudan (rare foreign wood altars) and kagucho butsudan (furniture style altars) (details of which are to be referred to the respective sections).
In contemporary Japanese, the term 'butsudan' generally indicates a household Buddhist altar installed at home as mentioned above, although in a broad sense it means the entire range of alters dedicated to Buddha including platforms (shumidan (An altar made of fine timber, generally with paneling)) to install Buddhist images in the hall of a temple.
Butsudan is also called 'Onaibutsu' (literally, indoor Buddha) when it must be especially distinguished from that in a broad sense.
There are two theories to explain the origin of butsudan; one refers to 'jibutsudo' (small private buildings or rooms used by noble men to enshrine their own Buddhist images and for their own personal spiritual edification) and another to 'tamadana' (alters dedicated to spirits of ancestors).
In ancient India, people made 'a ceremonial mound' of earth where they enshrined 'Gods.'
Later, the earth mound was roofed in to avoid rain and wind.
This was the origin of temples.
To inherit this origin, the Chinese character of 'dan' has a left-hand radical tsuchi-hen (the 'earth' radical.)
On May 5, 685, Emperor Tenmu issued an imperial edict that 'every state should build its own hotokenomiya (an accommodation for Buddha) to install Buddha images with sutras, and worship them and hold a mass for them.'
Accordingly, the twenty-seventh day of each month is designated as 'butsudan no hi' (the day of Buddhist altars) by Zen Nihon Shukyo Yogu Kyodokumiai (literally, a Cooperative of Religious Utensils Dealers of all Japan).
Tamamushi no Zushi (a miniature temple owned by Horyu-ji Temple, with beetles' wings used as parts of its decoration) is considered as the oldest butsudan in existence in Japan.
However, the current butsudan is not originated directly from the above said imperial edict.
Some of the upper crust including aristocracy used to possess their own personal Buddha statues.
They were installed, for example, in Byodo-in Ho-do (Ho-do Hall of Byodoin Temple) of Yorimichi FUJIWARA and in Rokuon-ji Temple of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.
Also butsudan is considered to have its origin in a life-size Yakushi-butsu (the healing Buddha), which was made and worshipped at home by SUGAWARA no Takasue no musume (the daughter of SUGAWARA no Takasue,) an original writer of "Sarashina Nikki" (the Sarashina Diary).
According to Choshu TAKEDA, the above mentioned jibutsudo (a small building or room for a noble man to enshrine and worship Buddhist images) was contracted or dwarfed into butsuma (a room for Buddha) and further made smaller into butsudan to be suitably put indoors.
In the Muromachi period, Rennyo, the eighth head of Hongan-ji Temple and the originator of restoration of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land sect of Buddhism,) gave her followers the hanging scrolls with the script of 'Namu Amidabutsu' (a single, sincere call upon the name of Amida) and encouraged them to enshrine the scrolls at their own butsudan.
Butsudan was made in imitation of the head temple of the respective sect, which paved the way for the current kin butsudan.
Therefore, Jodo Shinshu Sect has set many standard operating rules on butsudan.
Even now in the Jodo Shinshu Sect, it is observed that honzon (principal Buddhist image) of a butsudan should be a hanging scroll acquired from its head temple through each family's ancestral temple.
However, butsudan is a unique custom of Japan, since it cannot be seen in other Buddhist countries like the Kingdom of Thailand.
Those people of Buddhism, other than the Japanese, do not need to have other miniature temples at home because they feel familiar enough with their nearby temples and because of an additional category of kuyodan (a small altar for memorial services of each family to their ancestors.)
In Mongolia, a butsudan of Tibetan Buddhism is occasionally installed in a yurt (house).
Tamadana (also known as Bondana and Mizudana) is an altar to greet spirits of the newly dead and ancestors of each family during the Bon festival.
While its figure varies according to the area and period of its origin, one example is a board fixed on four corner pillars of bamboo or wood, and another is to use a tea table.
Kunio YANAGIDA claims this tamadana had changed from temporary use during the Bon festival to permanent installation and eventually became the butsudan.
At present, Takeda's theory of jibutsudo as the origin of butsudan is regarded as dominant.
In the Edo period, contemporary bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) instituted as a part of its policy for religions the Terauke seido (the system of organizing whole temples in Japan with registration of follower families) and made it mandatory for every family to become a parishioner of any temple designated as its bodaiji (a family temple).
In witness of being a parishioner of a certain temple, each family became accustomed to install a household butsudan to worship every morning and evening and to invite a priest of its bodaiji temple to hold memorial services to commemorate anniversaries of their ancestors' death dates.
This custom became widespread among the common people whose lives became rich in the wake of stabilization of society.
These butsudan around the country were greatly influenced by such blooming technologies of construction of temples and shrines in the Genroku era as were seen in Nikko Tosho-gu Shrines.
Many production centers of kin butsudan reportedly prospered by contemporary miyadaiku (specialists in construction of shrines and temples).
In this regard, however, there are many other opinions which are to be further studied including the question about the time when butsudan became nationally popularized.
In the Kamakura period, the Zen sect had introduced ihai which became gradually adopted by the other sects except Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land sect) and became common in the Edo period.
Those ihai tablets were then installed in ihai-dan (an altar for ihai tablets) or other altars made in imitation of butsudan of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Later, butsudan of Zen sect style was created in order to discriminate it from that of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Accordingly, other sects than Jodo Shinshu became less strict with butsudan than the Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Meanwhile Shinto has soreisha (where ancestral spirits are enshrined) which corresponds to butsudan of Buddhism.
Kami (Gods of Shinto) are enshrined on kamidana (a shelf for Gods), while ancestors are worshipped at soreisha.
This soreisha is an altar of Shinto style developed from Buddhist kuyodan.
Before the Edo period, however, kamidana had been dedicated also to such ancestors' spirits as had passed away more than the 32nd anniversary of one's death.
Butsudan for the family of a resident priest of a temple is specially called 'Onaibutsu' (literally, 'indoor Buddha').
If the term of butsudan simply means a miniature temple, it should not be necessary for any temple which has already its own main hall for Buddha, but an onaibutsu altar is additionally installed in many temples considering it serves for the spirits of ancestors.
Butsudan is equipped with a door.
It is reportedly made in imitation of a temple gate.
Inside of a temple's main hall for Buddha, there is a folding scroll fixed to share borders with its inner sanctuary.
Accordingly, butsudan also has its folding screen inside of the door.
Inside of butsudan is composed of three platforms, the highest of which in the center is called 'shumidan.'
Shumidan is said to be made in the shape of Mt. Sumeru (Buddhism as the highest mountain in the world).
Especially, a space on the top of shumidan is called 'kuden' (zushi) (a kind of feretory) where honzon is enshrined.
Since this shumidan is designed in imitation of the inner sanctuary of the head temple of each sect, its configuration differs by sect.
Both sides of honzon are dedicated to wakiji-butsu (Buddha accompanying honzon) and soshi (the founder of relevant sect).
The uppermost platform including shumidan is equipped with 'koran' (balustrade).
On the platform under the uppermost, install ihai.
If there are plural numbers of ihai tablets, they are placed in alternate shifts of right and left toward them.
In postwar days, people began to make holes in the upper sections of both right and left sides of butsudan.
These holes are made for lacing electric distribution cables for lanterns.
Though little difference is seen in the case of karaki butsudan, kin butsudan have remarkable variations as follows:
Hongan-ji School of Jodo Shinshu Sect (Nishi Hongan-ji Temple)
Butsudan with a single gabled roof (palace) and gilded pillars (palace and outer pillars), both made in imitation of Amidado hall of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple
Shinshu Otani School (Higashi Hongan-ji Temple)
Butsudan with a double tiled roof (palace) made in imitation of Daishi-do hall of Higashi Hongan-ji temple, with black lacquered pillars (palace and outer pillars) made in imitation of Amidado hall of the same temple, and with vermillion lacquered balustrades with gilded ornamental railing tops.
There are other features to be seen than the above, which, however, differ by the district of each butsudan.
Butsudan of Nichiren Sho Sect (Taiseki-ji Temple) is quite different in configuration from those of other sects, since it is equipped with a door copied from zushi, while, recently, many assembled zushi-type butsudan can be seen.
In some cases, people put nothing other than zushi on the top of shumidan, as in the case of temples.
Measurement of butsudan and butsugu (a Buddhist altar and its fittings) is based on shakkan-ho (a Japanese measuring system).
Dai' is used as a measure to represent sizes of kin butsudan.
This corresponds to sizes of hanging scrolls to be hanged inside butsudan, indicating the space to hang three scrolls.
For example, butsudan of 50 dai means the butsudan has a space to hang three hanging scrolls of 50 dai size.
In this regard, hanging scrolls are specified to be those ordered from the head temple of Jodo Shinshu Sect (because followers of Jodo Shinshu Sect must enshrine such hanging scroll as sent for from the head temple).
There are various sizes, such as 20 dai, 30 dai, 50 dai, 70 dai, 100 dai, 120 dai, 150 dai and 200 dai.
Though dimensions of each size differ to some degree depending on sect, the dimensions of butsudan size remain the same through all sects.
Specifically, the dimensions of butsudan sizes are as follows, though they may differ by production area.
Examples: 30 dai means about 42 cm in inner dimension; 50 dai means about 48 cm in inner dimension; 70 dai means about 54 cm in inner dimension.
While the above figures are all inner measurements, the outer dimensions of each size, 50 dai for example, are different from each other.
The measure of 'Dai' is based on precepts of Jodo Shinshu Sect, suggesting the strong linkage between kin butsudan altar and Jodo Shinshu Sect.
This measure goes by the size of objects to be put inside, being rare as a norm of measuring.
Besides, outer dimensions are also used in many areas for measuring kin butsudan in the same way as for karaki butsudan.
Measurements of karaki butsudan are indicated by outer dimensions of its height and door width.
The door width means the entire breadth of a portion of closed door.
Example: 43-18 means about 130 cm in height and about 54 cm in door width.
Depending on local customs, dimensions of the door width are indicated before that of the height.
Since the door width is just the width of the door itself, the total dimensions of width and depth of each size, 43-20 for example, are different from each other.
Measurements of small butsudan which are usually installed on the top of tansu (chest) are indicated by 'go' or 'take' for total heights.
Example: 18 go means about 54 cm in height, and 20 go means about 60 cm in height.
Number of butsudan is counted by 'ki,' 'hon' and 'dai.'
Ki' is a counter suffix to mean installation.
In this case, the installation is meant in other words to fit the owner's house, so that 'dai' and 'hon' are mainly used during the process of production and sale.
Therefore, the terms as the number of hon (or dai) on exhibition and the number of hon (or dai) in production are the properly used expressions.
To decorate solemnly inside of butsudan with butsugu is called shogon.
Honzon is enshrined there, which is either butsuzo (a Buddha statue) or a hanging scroll.
Honzon is an object to be enshrined but is not called butsugu.
Right from the start, butsudan has been dedicated to honzon, and, therefore, it is no more than furniture if honzon is not enshrined in it yet, nor does it function as butsudan until honzon is installed with the solemn decoration of butsugu, (although this idea is based on the view that butsudan originates from a miniature temple, and, from the point of view that butsudan's origin is kuyodan, any altar with ihai and pictures of ancestors installed is included in the category of butsudan).
Butsugu Commonly Used Among All Sects
They are toro (a lantern), san-gusoku (three specific articles for a butsudan altar) (go-gusoku (five specific articles for a butsudan altar)), kabin (a vase), koro (an incense burner), hitate (candle stands), buppanki (a rice bowl for a Buddhist altar), rin (a bell for a Buddhist altar), uchishiki (a piece of cloth laid in a Buddhist altar), kakocho (a family register of deaths), kendai (also known as kakocho-dai (a stand for kakocho)), kyozukue (a sutra desk), kogo (an incense container), and so on.
Butsugu only for Jodo Shinshu and its Lineage
They are kebyo (a special kind of vase), kasha-koro (a special kind of incense burner), kuge (an offering stand), rinto (a Buddhist hanging lantern), homyo-jiku (a hanging scroll with posthumous Buddhist names written on it) and so on.
Butsugu Only for the Other Sects than Jodo Shinshu and its Linage
They are chatoki (a special tea cup for Buddhist altar), takatsuki (a standing tray for cake and fruit), ryoguzen (a special tray for servings for Buddha), and others such as mokugyo (a wooden drum), shogo (a metal drum) and mokusho (another type of wooden drum).
Contents of butsugu vary by Buddhist sects.
Even such Butsugu as with the same name have different shapes and colors according to the sect.
Butsugu used by Jodo Shinshu Sect and its lineage are black-lacquered in the blue range, while those used by other sects are vermillion-lacquered in the vermillion range.
The following are regarded as items not to be kept in Butsudan.
Photograph
No sect has such doctrine as to decorate butsudan with photograph.
The main hall of a temple, which was the origin of butsudan, represents Jodo (the Buddhist pure land) and, therefore, no picture of the dead is decorated inside its sanctum, and accordingly no picture is put into butsudan.
No photograph is supposed to be installed in butsudan because it is nothing more than an instrument to remember the dead.
However, actually most households keep in butsudan a small photograph of the departed, which was decorated at his funeral.
Buddha Statues of Other Sects
They should be enshrined separately in zushi or others.
Amulets and Talismans
They are to be brought along with the holders, or to be enshrined separately.
When a new butsudan is purchased, a priest is required to hold kaigen (a Buddhist service to consecrate a newly enshrined Buddhist image).
This is so called 'shonen-ire' (literally, 'to breathe life') into butsuzo, hanging scroll and ihai.
Only through this ceremony, honzon and ihai become the objects of devotion and the new butsudan changes itself from just a container box to a real Buddhist altar.
This ceremony is also called nyubutsu-shiki, owatamashi, nyukon-shiki, otama-ire and so on, depending on the sect.
Since this is a festive occasion, gifts are wrapped and tied by red-and-white codes.
The description on an envelope of gifts are to be 'Kaigen Kuyo-ryo' (donation for consecration ceremony), 'Nyubutsu-shiki Ofuse' (offering for consecration ceremony) or others.
Priests are often required to hold this consecration ceremony at the same time as hoyo (memorial services) if the date of the latter is not very far from the former's.
In the event of disposal of butsudan, 'shonen-nuki' (withdrawal of life) from butsuzo, hanging scroll and ihai is required.
When kin butsudan is to be washed, 'shonen-nuki' must be done once and then 'shonen-ire' must be done after washing.
In Nichiren Sho Sect, nyubutsu-shiki (a consecration ceremony) is held being guided by doshi (the master priest) when honzon is newly bestowed, and is also held under the guidance of hossu (the head priest of the sect) when a temple is newly built or when honzon is newly enshrined in the main hall, or when the main hall of the temple is reconstructed, (if a main hall is reconstructed but honzon is not newly bestowed, rakusei-shiki (an inauguration ceremony) is held in combination with kaigen-kuyo for existing honzon after restoration of the hall).
In the cases of moving house or purchases of butsudan, relocation ceremonies are often held.
Shonen-nuki' and 'shonen-ire' are not conducted from and into butsudan.
Recently, pets are considered as family members.
Consequently, when pets died, funerals, graves and butsudan for them are increasingly arranged.
Basically, pets do not share the same butsudan with human beings.
Butsudan to worship pets are separately arranged.
It is because the world they live (chikushodo (the realm of animals)) is different from the one human live (ningendo (the realm of human)).
Beside their photographs and ancestral tablets, statues of Bato Kannon (horse-headed Kannon) or Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Buddhisattva) are enshrined.
Assets for religious services including butsudan, butsugu, kamidana and gravestones are not regarded as taxable properties in the inheritance tax law.
In other words, they are excluded from taxation.
This is because butsudan, for example, is not regarded as a personal property but as a common property.
However, any item which is hardly considered as the object of beliefs, such as a Buddhist statue made of pure gold, is a taxable property.
Nichiren Shoshu Sect is one of the religious schools of Buddhism which had Nichiren as the founder of a religious sect, and was founded by Nikko.
Within other schools of the Nichiren sects, it belongs to Fujimon School (Nikkomon School), which embraces Nichiren Honbutsu Ron (the idea that Nichiren himself was an incarnation of the eternal Buddha) and Shoretsu School, and so on, as their doctrine, and is one of the powerful schools in the Fujimon School to which two honzan (head temple) of 'Komon Hachi Honzan' (eight major temples of Nikkomon School (Fujimon School)), Taiseki-ji Temple (Sohonzan (grand head temple)) and Shimojo Myoren-ji Temple (honzan (head temple)), belong.
After the founder passed away, Nikko, one of the Six Disciples, built and found Honzan Taiseki-ji Temple to be 'Gokaizan' (founding a temple) practically, and influenced the doctrine and absolute direction of the school.
Nikko only stayed there for seven years and left the temple after an invitation from the Ishikawa clan when he moved to Omosu-dansho (a Buddhist seminary built in the Omosu Honmon-ji Temple) (current Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple Kongen, also known as Omosu Honmon-ji Temple of Nichiren Sect) in his later years, then he passed the kechimyaku (heritage of the Law) to Nichimoku, taught his disciples up and passed away in this place.
It officially called itself as Nichiren Shoshu Sect in the early the Meiji period, after being one of Shoretsu School of Nichiren Sect (known as Taisekiji School), and at one time, creating Komon School of Nichiren Sect, also known as Nichiren Honmon Sect, the combined school by Hachihonzan (eight major temples) of Fujimon School with other mountains of the Fujimon School.
While the position of the chief abbot became in rotation from Hachihonzan in the period as Nichiren Honmon Sect, it broke away from the sect under the official allowance of the branch temples of Taiseki-ji Temple to be independent, and called themselves Fuji School of Nichiren Sect in 1900, then renamed Nichiren Shoshu Sect in 1912 up to the present, however, it was apparent that they called themselves Shoshu Sect, which supposably meant shoshubun (the main part) of Hoke-kyo (Lotus Sutra), until at least the middle of the Edo period, according to the book of Kanazawa local history (it has 'Shoshu no Daimoku' (Chant of Shoshu)).
Please refer to 'Shoretsu School' in relation to the general doctrine of Shoretsu School.
On November 24, 1279, it was decided that the principle image (Nichiren Shoshu Sect) attributed to the appearance of the founder of the sect, Nichiren (enshrined at Hoan-do of Taiseki-ji Temple, Sohonzan) as one of kimyo eji (basis to take refuge), and it was Nichiren's long-cherished ambition, and was stated as the ultimate end of the Great Mandala of Mandala of the appearance of the founder of the sect.
The basic doctrine is that if a person believes in the correct principal image Honmon Kaidan no Dai-Gohonzon (the Great Object of Veneration of the Sanctuary of the True Teaching)) and practices daimoku (Nichiren chant) with Jigyo Keta (benefiting oneself and benefiting others), anyone can become Buddha in his or her lifetime.
Also, while various religious precepts are preached in each Buddhist sect, the precept, namely 'Sandai Hiho no Juji' (remembering and honoring the Three Great Secret Dharmas) are preached in Nichiren Shoshu Sect.
Thus it is said that each individual believer practices precept only by 'not to have any Hobo (slander of the Law)' (that is to say, not to pray for the principle images other than that of Nichiren Shoshu Sect) and 'to conduct study of Buddhism and chant Nichiren chants (that is to say, to teach Buddhism widely to the world).
That is to say, in Nichiren Shoshu Sect, the principle image is considered as the center of 'Sandai Hiho' (the Three Great Secret Dharmas).
Other than above, the distinctive points in the unique doctrines of the Sect are follows.
The founder of the sect is, in public manner, Jogyo Bosatsu (Bodhisattva Superior Practices) who was predicted in Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra) to save the end of the world, and in private manner, Kuon Ganjo no Jiju Yushin (Buddha of beginningless time) (that is to say, gohonbutsu (the principle image)).
The founder of the Sect was called Nichiren Daishonin.
It is only the Fujimon School which uses the respectful title of Daishonin for the title of gohonbutsu of Mappo (Age of the Final Dharma); in the Nichiren Sect (Itchi School, and so on), it means Nichiren Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva Nichiren).
The founder of the Sect informally notified to found the sect on May 4, 1253, and declared the foundation on June 2.
It is said Nikko received 'Yuiju Ichinin no Kechimyaku Sojo' (transmission of the heritage of the Law to only one person) from the founder of the Sect in accordance with Nika Sojo (documents which were believed to be addressed from Nichiren to his disciple, Nikko) in 1282.
After that, it was passed onto Nichimoku the third, Nichido the fourth, Nichigyo the fifty in order, it is passed to current hoshu (high priest), Nichinyo the sixty eighth.
Those doctrines are examples.
Currently, as the basis of scriptures, Hokke Sanbu-kyo Sutra (The Threefold Lotus Sutra), literary remains of the founder ("Nichiren Daishonin Gosho" (Letters of Nichiren)), those of Nikko the second, Nichiu the ninth and Nichikan the twenty sixth are legitimate scriptures, however, 10 volumes of Makashikan (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation) and Guketsu (Commentary on Makashikan) of the Tendai Sect, 10 volumes of Hokke Gengi (Essentials of the Lotus Sutra) and Shakusen (Commentary on Hokke Gengi), and 10 volumes of Hokke mongu (Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra) and Shoki (Commentary on Hoke-kyo Sutra), are also accepted as minor scriptures.
As the basis of Buddhism, Sanbo (3 treasures of Buddhism: Buddha, sutras and priesthood), it is considered the founder of the Sect as the treasure of Buddha of beginningless time, Dai Mandala (Great Mandala) of Nam Myoho Renge-kyo Sutra (Devotion to the Law of Hoke-kyo) as the treasure of sutra, and the successive hoshu, of which Nikko the second, who was 'a person of kechimyaku fuho' (the person receiving the transmission of the heritage of the Law), was at the head, as the treasure of priest (priesthood).
Originally the Sect officially insisted as the policy that, 'in Hoke-kyo it is said a woman cannot become a Buddha due to five obstacles,' but they changed their policy completely that 'it is only Hoke-kyo which taught that women can become a Buddha' after the defeat in 1945, when there was a movement at General Headquarters (GHQ) to eliminate the feudalistic atmosphere (Note that there is Shoman-kyo (Shri-mala Sutra) which taught the theory that women become a Buddha).
However, this change of policy was followed as there was no other choice but for Nichiren Shoshu Sect to do so in order to have a future as a religious school, since there was political pressure from GHQ described as 'GHQ strikes fear in the hearts of the people.'
There is a theory that the abovementioned change happened in the same way as there was talisman held at the temples to accommodate themselves into Yokusan Taisei (Support system of Taisei Yokusan-kai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association)), and it did not come from opportunism and shameless.
* As it is preached in Daibadatta-bon (Chapter on "Devadatta," the 12th chapter of Hoke-kyo) that an eight year old dragon girl did Sokushin Jobutsu (attaining Buddhahood with the present body), thus in Japan, Hoke-kyo has been respected from ancient times as a doctrine in which women become a Buddha, and Hoke-kyo enshrined in kokubun-niji (nunnery temples) built all over Japan by the order of Emperor Shomu.
Also it is said in the literary remains of Nichiren describe as follows;
It said that especially it is not allowed for women to become a Buddha they die in other crest, (Nyonin Jobutsu Sho (Letters of attainment of Buddhahood by women)).
In Hoke-kyo women are allowed to become a Buddha.
(Reply to Goro Taro HOSHINA)
Only in Hoke-kyo that women can become a Buddha, for Hoon-kyo (the Sutra on the Buddha's Repayment of his Indebtedness) which we receive their kindness from mother's love (Reply to Sennichi ama Gozen)
Thus, there is many thoughts of 'Nyonin Jobutsu' (attainment of Buddhahood by women) in Nichiren's thought, the founder of the Sect, this criticism is in fact not true.
Nikko achieved brilliant success working actively in shakubuku (a method of propagating Buddhism which was practiced by Nichiren Daishonin) as one of the six old monks of close disciples of the founder of the Sect, and established a powerful organization for religious society especially in Suruga Province.
This rapid movement of propagation caused suspicions among the people of other religious sects or the authorities within Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and in 1279 the monks and ordinary people around Atsuhara village were suppressed badly, and finally there was an incident where three believers of farmers became martyrs (Atsuhara Persecution).
After the founder of the Sect, Nichiren died, in the Mausoleum, a rotation system was organized by six disciples, however five disciples other than Nikko refused to do this routine due to the unsecured situation in wars or plagues, propagation in distant areas, and so on.
Nikkomon School of Nichiren Shoshu Sect and Nichiren Honshu Sect insisted that Nikko, the position of betto (chief officer) of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu was forced to leave the temple by the hobo of jito (manager and lord of manor), Rokuro Sanenaga HAKII-bo, after the order of Hyuga, one of the original six old monk disciples.
Nikko founded Taho Fujisan Shimonobo (Shimonobo Temple on Mt. Fuji) in 1289 and is currently know as sacred place where Fujimon School and Nikkomon School originated from.
On the following year in 1290, Nikko founded Taiseki-ji Temple at the foot of Mt. Fuji after receiving donations from Tokimitsu NANJO.
Since then, the various schools which derived from 'Nichiren Sect of Nikko' and commonly called Fujimon School or Nikkomon School for a long time, have no doctrinally interaction and religious communication with Nichiren Sect, the combination of forty-eight honzan of Shoretsu School and Itchi School (of the Nichiren sect) under the religious policy before the War, however, they have academically interaction with them and sometimes monks from Nichiren Sect visited Taiseki-ji Temple.
Among them, Nichiren Shoshu Sect still insists thatevery other schools, including Nichiro School, and even other Fujimon Schools (later, it took a conciliatory attitude towards Nichiren Sect and did not follow Taiseki-ji Temple) are took as hobo because Nichiren's correct teachings were only passed to dharma lineage linked to Nichido through Nikko and Nichimoku
In the Edo period, Taiseki-ji Temple was allowed to have dokureiseki (privilege to meet shogun face to face) at Edo-jo Castle, and Hiyori the twenty fifth, a grandchild of Emperor Gomizunoo, was adopted as the son of Hiroko KONOE, the lawful wife of the sixth Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA, and he was respected by the Imperial family, court nobles, the shogunate families and daimyo family (feudal lord family); however, there was strict control over missionary work by Edo bakufu, the same as for other religious schools, and there was continuous religious persecution in many places such as Kaga clan, Sendai clan, Ii and Owari clan, and Hachinohe clan, and so on.
Kanazawa Persecution, which Nichiren Shoshu Sect suffered, was occurred because Myojyo-ji Temple of Mt. Kinei (later became honzan) in Hakui City, Ishikawa Prefecture, one of the Itchi School of Nichiren Sect, of which sohonzan was Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu, made a false report to Kaga clan, and later on it was found out that Myojyo-ji Temple of the Itchi School of Nichiren Sect feaced criminal charges by making false reports to be punished by being placed under house arrest.
Most persecution that Nichiren Shoshu Sect had to take were due to false charges made by the Itchi School of Nichiren Sect of which honzan is Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu.
There is a detailed description about Kanazawa Persecution in 'Search for religious persecution of Kanazawa' written by the historical writer, Toshiko MUKAI.
There was a conflict between the religious society of Taiseki-ji Temple and national power due to the Meiji Restoration in 1868.
Thus, the Meiji government, which basically tried to nationalize Shintoism as part of religious policy, tried to govern each Buddhist school individually due to tight control and political regulation.
There was a background that the chief abbot of the Nichiren Sect, Nissatsu ARAI, and others aimed to 'unify the whole Nichiren discipline.'
Although Nichiren the fifty fourth of Taiseki-ji Temple put application 'to be independent temple of Taiseki-ji Temple' to Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion) in 1873 and continued to seek approval, it was not accepted, and in 1876, Hachihonzan (eight head temples) of Taiseki-ji Temple, Shimojo Myoren-ji Temple, Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple, Kyoro Yobo-ji Temple, Koizumi Kuon-ji Temple, Hota Myohon-ji Temple, Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple and Izu Jitsujo-ji Temple, which were belonged to the Fujimon School, were categorized as Konon Schools of Nichiren Sect (later renamed Nichiren Honmon Sect).
There was no choice but for the Hachihonzan to have 'an official position in Komon School (chief abbot of Honmon School)' in rotation as representative of a religious school for political purposes, and Nippu the fifty fifth Hoshu became the fourth chief abbot from 1881 to 1882, and Nichio the fifty sixth Hoshu became the fifth chief abbot from 1891 to 1892.
The rank of the chief priest of Taiseki-ji Temple remained the same as Hoshu, while the position of the chief abbot was sometimes assumed by those from Hobo which was an unusual and humiliating situation for monks and other people of Taisekiji School, and the religious group itself was in an insecure situation.
However, after that, Nippu the fifty fifth and Nichio the fifty sixty continued to protest several times against the situation and for other seven honzan temples to stop the activity to the government, and finally they got approval for the group to be independent Honmon Sect and it was officially called Fuji School of the Nichiren Sect in 1900.
Then it was renamed 'Nichiren Shoshu Sect' by the decision of Nissho the fifty seventh on June 7, 1912, which is the current official name.
In 1930, Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (literally, Value-Creation Education Society) was established as an educational group by Tsunesaburo MAKIGUCHI and Josei TODA who declared their policy of a combined doctrine of Nichiren Shoshu Sect and a belief in Makiguchi's 'theory of value,' and Makiguchi assumed the position as the first president; however, Nichiren Shoshu Sect did not accept Soka Kyoiku Gakkai as a group of believers (Makiguchi described in the record, 'Soka Kyoiku Gakkai is not just pure Nichiren Shoshu Sect, but it is an independent group that proceeds my own theory of value.'
After the Pacific War ended, Toda assumed the position as the second president and he changed the name from Soka Kyoiku Gakkai to Soka Gakkai (literally, Value-Creation Society), and after that, Nichiren Shoshu Sect itself became very popular.
Especially after Taisaku IKEDA became the third president, (current chairperson emeritus) in 1960, it was the best time for Nichiren Shoshu Sect and Soka Gakkai, since kyakuden (guest hall) (Taiseki-ji Temple) and Shohon-do (Taiseki-ji Temple) were built with the donations from former Hokke Ko (the former Buddhist parishioner) and believers of Soka Gakkai.
However, the Soka Gakkai side gradually continued to insist on the change of doctrine, and after going through various issues in 1977, Nichiren Shoshu Sect excommunicated Soka Gakkai on November 28, 1991, in the name of the sixty seventh Hoshu at that time, Nikken.
However, in the records of Shumuin Propagation Hall, there is no record of the approval for Soka Gakkai to establish its organization, and the relationship between Nichiren Shoshu Sect and Soka Gakkai is the same as that between Itchi School of Nichiren Sect and Rissho Koseikai (Buddhist organization founded by Nikkyo NIWANO and Myoko NAGANUMA), and some people said that Soka Gakkai was not an official believers group after all.
Usually, in the believers' group (Kochu) of Nichiren Shoshu Sect, the chief priest of the branch temples (instructor) and the representative of the believers need to apply for 'approval of establishing an organization' to Shumuin, and after the application is processed in Shumuin, Hoshu, the chief abbot of Nichiren Shoshu Sect signs and puts his seal onto it; however Soka Gakkai has neither a record of receiving approval for establishing the organization nor instructor from the beginning, and they were treated as outsiders within Nichiren Shoshu Sect.
Nichiren Sect separated into many religious schools after the beginning of the religion, and one of them is called Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu, sozan (the mountain of the foundation) Nichiren Sect, where there are many believers from samurai families, and they strengthened their power under the bakufu government and came to control the whole Nichiren Sect.
On the other hand, Taiseki-ji Temple of the Nikko School, who are the successors of the same kechimyaku (heritage of the Law) of Yuiju Ichinin (succeed everything that the master knows about the art to only one excellent disciple), has installed the So-mon gate (main gate) in Palace-style, made of dark wood (Kuro-mon gate), and a red lacquered Sanmon gate and Niten-mon gate with kikumon (chrysanthemum crest) and Chokushi-mon gate (the gate for the Imperial Envoys) and they showed the power of their religious school to the court nobles with architecture.
However, the above buildings were not allowed to be built without imperial sanction before the war, so these buildings were the one to prove that there was imperial sanction for Taiseki-ji Temple.
It is said that the above mentioned poems were made to criticize two deferent schools of Nichiren Sect, but there are some questions raised in terms of the practical part.
The beginning of the poem is a collection of poetry from the Keicho era, 'Biyokunkashu' (a collection of Muromachi kouta (popular songs in the Muromachi period)).
There is a poem made by an unknown poet which said, 'Mt. Minobu for samurai families, Mt. Fuji for court nobles, Ishiyama for emperors' favorite.'
The hoshu who succeeded the blood line of Yuiju Ichinin is the highest ranked monk of the Nichiren Shoshu Sect, and the rank of the monk was daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order).
In recent religious regulations, only hoshu can definitely become the chief abbot, the manager of Shumu (General Affairs of a sect) politics, after going through a candidate selection meeting for the chief abbot.
Hoshu also work as chief abbot of a Buddhist temple (chief priest) of Sohonzan Taiseki-ji Temple.
The current hoshu is the sixty eighth, Nichinyo HAYASE.
If the next candidate for the successor of hoshu was officially announced, he will be appointed as Gakuto (head student).
The official rank of Gakuto as monk is Gon no Daisojo (the second-ranking of Buddhist monk).
However if the successor is not officially announced, the position of Gakuto is kept vacant.
There are some noge (master) who are a group of high priests one rank next to hoshu, and currently there are ten monks who are in the position of noge excluding former Hoshu Nikken.
Hoshu are called by using their respect title such as 'go hoshu Nichi X jonin geika' and 'Nichi X jonin.'
The former hoshu who leave the temple and retire are called with the respective title of 'goinson geika' or 'goinson jonin.'
The respective title of Jonin (Saint) can be donated or given to as conferring court rank posthumously to noge or former hoshu, after getting the approval of hoshu.
Also Buddhist name with the character of nichi (日) is called Nichigo, which is given to monks while they are alive.
However, only a high priest with rank higher than noge (a lower priest in the highest position) can officially name Nichigo while they are alive.
However, some monks who are not in a high position or lay believers of the religious group can have Nichigo after they die, while they are given posthumous Buddhist names by the approval of hoshu as well.
Only hoshu has the right' to give Jonin go (name) or Nichigo, the same condition as to give rights of honzon shosha ken (rights to make a written copy of the principle images) and kyogi saitei-ken (right to judge doctrines).
These 'centralization' of important powers shows the prohibition of 'independent honzan' beyond the control of sohonzan, in contrast to the Minobu schools of Nichiren Sect, where the local chief priest himself makes a written copy of the principle image of Monji Mandala (mandala depicted Buddha in Chinese characters, scriptures, and so on) and gives away copies to his close believers.
As the position of kancho (the chief abbot) is set as the head to supervise the office work of Shumuin.
The kancho also works as Hoshu and the chief priest of Taiseki-ji Temple.
Shumuin locate in the precincts of Sohonzan Taiseki-ji Temple.
There is a modern official system established and general political matters are divided into five divisions under the supervision of the General Office Director who supports kancho, such as Shomubu (General Affairs Department), Kyogakubu (Educational Department), Kaigaibu (Overseas Department), Shogaibu (Public Relations Department) and Zaimubu (Finance Department).
Furthermore, there is juyaku, a position of executive which follows the position of kancho and sokan (general office director), who works as advisor.
In each department, there is bucho (general manager), fuku-bucho (assistant general manager) (currently there is no one in this position in Kaigaibu and Zaimubu and shunin (manager), and especially, the bucho of Shomubu is practically in the position of supporting sokan.
Apart from above, there are Shukai, which is a committee elected by an election among monks, Kanseikai (監正会) which is enforcement of the law of the land, and representative system introduced which has a group of five people participating in government who are appointed by kancho and are higher rank than gondaisozu (Junior prelate).
Shomuin regulated propagation districts all over Japan called Dai Fukyo-ku (大布教区, large propagation district), and other districts which are controlled by Dai Fukyo-ku.
There is Tokubetsu Fukyo-ku (特別布教区, special propagation district) within tatchu (a sub-temple on the premise of a large temple) of sohonzan.
The office matters in Tokubetsu Fukyo-ku are dealt within Naikotobu (Department of Operation of the Temple) of Taiseki-ji Temple.
In Naikotobu there is one shunin riji (chief director), one or two shitsuji (stewards), and some riji (administrators) are appointed within the chief priests of tatchu temples under the supervision of Hoshu, and they become representatives of operations of the temple of sohonzan.
Legally, hoshu acts as the representative committee of Taiseki-ji Temple, and the shunin riji, riji, and sodai (the representative) act as responsible committee members.
Shunin riji and shitsuji are to support hoshu's judicial affairs as the chief priest of Taiseki-ji Temple, and when hoshu is away, they act as doshi (officiating monks) to conduct Buddhist memorial services.
The chief priest, shukan (supervisor), assistant of the chief priest, fuku-shukan (assistant of shukan) are created by a quite centralized system; they are sent by sohonzan with an order from kacho, and it is not a hereditary or family-run system which can often be seen in traditional Buddhism after the Meiji restoration.
Therefore sometimes there is a change in the chief priest in a short period of time or exchange of a chief priest between two temples.
The assistant chief priest and fuku-shukan are appointed by the chief priest and kancho with instructors in accordance with the regulation of the Sect, and after that they are assumed their new positions after receiving approval from hoshu.
Thus the head priest can not use the property of the temple as his own property (inheritance, and so on).
In old days, monks used to have disciples within the sect to become new monks, but currently people can apply to become a monk by passing the inspection to enter the Buddhist priesthood and become a disciple of Saint hoshu.
Most of the monks are twelve years old when entering the Buddhist priesthood, and as soon as they finish primary school they become the priests.
Other candidates for monks from ordinary people are invited at any time.
After entering into the priesthood and finishing training until the last year of the high school at Taiseki-ji Temple of sohonzan, they work for temples in the countries (mostly for temples with the same rank as honzan and for those around large cities) for about four years, followed by working for sohonzan for one year, and he or she will be appointed as assistant instructor (allowed to teach Buddhist law), and will be sent to temples in the countries as chief priests (or assistant chief priests) if there is an order from kancho.
Some monks spend all their lives in sohonzan after entering into priesthood.
All the priest's robes have shiro-gojo kesa (kesa (Buddhist stole) divided into five parts longitudinally colored white) and clothes with a thin black (there are differences in the pattern of the clothes, depending on the rank of the monks), and monks are not allowed to wear these costumes without having a license to wear them from kancho.
In the generation who entered into the priesthood around 1965, which was called the honeymoon period of Soshu (Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shoshu Sect), many new temples were built rapidly thanks to huge donations from Soka Gakkai, some people were appointed that more monks and lower quality, just like 'quantity products of low quality,' because there were more ascetic monks who came from among lay believers than other traditional Buddhist schools, and currently they have a good reputation of their strict grounding on education of monks.
In Nichiren Shoshu Sect, the rank of the monk (rank of priest) is listed as follows.
Kyoshi (Instructor)
Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order) (hoshu or a person who was previously hoshu)
Gondaisojo (generally second grade Buddhist priest) (Gakuto)

Hokke Ko
Hokke Ko is the only religious group of Nichiren Shoshu Sect.
Each branch temple has XX Ko (kochu (religious groups)) of danka (supporter of a Buddhist temple), which collectively called themselves Hokke Ko.
Hokke Ko have existed since ancient times in religious history, known as the group that conducts daily Shodaigyo (the practice of chanting the daimoku (Nichiren chant)) or group climbing sohonzan, and Nichiren Shoshu Hokke Ko Zenkoku Rengokai (Japan Association of Hokke Ko of Nichiren Shoshu Sect, also known as Zenren for short), was established as a federation of XX Ko in 1962, and Hokke Ko joined the association.
This Zenren was renamed Nichiren Shoshu Sect Hokke Ko Rengokai (Association of Hokke Ko of Nichiren Shoshu Sect, also known as Rengokai for short) in 1967 and up to the present date.
To establish religious groups of Nichiren Shoshu Sect, the chief priest of the branch temples needs to be the chief kyoshi of the religious group to submit the application 'Soshiki Kessei Kyoka Negai' (the application for approval to establish an organization), in the joint signature with the representative of the people who wish to establish the group, to Shumuin, and after the application is processed, 'Soshiki Kessei Kyoka sho' (Approval to establish the organization) will be signed and imprinted with his seal by Hoshu, kancho of Nichiren Shoshu Sect, and approval will be given to XX Ko via the chief kyoshi.
This system has been maintained since the Meiji period, as it said in Nikko the second, 'these Homon (teachings of Buddhism) are to teach the right way from the teacher to the disciples' (Sadonokuni Hokke Ko Shu Gohenji (Reply to those of Hokke Ko in Sado Province)), and the traditions and customs were followed and some old documents still remain related to 'Soshiki Kessei Kyokasho' in the Edo period.
The organization, XX Ko, established under above procedure, submits the application to become a member of Nichiren Shoshu Hokke Ko Zenkoku Rengokai, and then the paperwork will being processed in the office of Nichiren Shoshu Hokke Ko Zenkoku Rengokai within sohonzan (known as Hokke Ko office).
Thus, groups which do not hold 'Soshiki Kessei Kyoka Negai' and do not have any chief kyoshi is not officially considered as a religious group of Nichiren Shoshu Sect.
In Hokke Ko, Daibyakuho paper published by Nichiren Shoshu Hokke Ko Rengokai is the only organ paper.
It is issued on the 1st and 16th of each month and is one hundred yen.
The Committee of the Hokke Ko
As the board member of Hokke Ko of each branch temple, there are koto (the head of the Ko), fuku-koto (vice head of the Ko), kanji (organizer), and kaikei (account) of representatives of kochu and they are all defined as 'Kumi-sewayaku' (careers of the religious group) not to teach members of Ko belonged to other temples since it is regarded as an ultravires act against chief kyoshi (the chief priest and shukan (supervisor)).
In Nichiren Shoshu Hokke Ko Rengokai, for the convenience of the official system, there are official positions such as iincho (chairman), fuku-iincho (vice chairman), riji, and chiho-bucho (manager in the local area), which are defined as 'Kumi-sewayaku' and not allowed to teach or supervise Hokke Ko who are members of 'Rengokai.'
There are honorable positions such as Sokoto (head of all Nichiren lay believers) and Daikoto (senior representative of Nichiren Shoshu Sect lay society) but they are not positions to teach believers of the group.
When they make public speeches in front of groups of believers, the speeches will be defined under the name of 'greetings' or 'encouragement.'
Hokke Ko in Overseas
Hokke Ko exist in about fifty countries overseas, and there are some temples or propagation offices which were built.
Especially in Indonesia it is said that about sixty million believers exist (the number was officially announced by the Indonesian government), and in Taiwan five temples were built and the number of believers is tending to increase.
Dainichiren
The only in-house magazine (Teaching Magazine) of Nichiren Shoshu Sect is called Dainichiren.
There are extra editions issued depending on the different situation.
It carrys information such as Shomuin rokuji (report of Shomuin), Sohonzan rokuji (report of sohonzan), Publication of Shomu, Hoshu's preaching, propagation lectures and essays, the activities of sohonzan and branch temples, overseas movement, greetings from the chief priest who newly assumed, and it costs three hundred yen.
In Shomuin rokuji, it has information such as a notice of a Buddhist memorial service at sohonzan, an official written notification of chief priest, approval of establishing organization of Kochu, approval of a committee of Hokke Ko for a supporters group, approval of representatives of supporters group of branch temples.
There are personnel information of sohonzan in sohonzan rokuji.
In the activities of sohonzan, it has information on Buddhist memorial service held at sohonzan, and in the activities of branch temples, it has information on Buddhist memorial services held at branch temples.
It was first published in 1916.
Also there are temple newsletters published in branch temples, and the only Dainichiren and newsletters of branch temples are considered as the official organ.
The basic activity of the disciple is to chant 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo' to the principle image and to read and learn Hoke-kyo (Nichiren chants for self awareness), as well as practicing Shakubuku (to correct another's false views and awaken that person to the truth of Buddhism) to teach these learnings to other people (chant of Keta (for other people)).
The basic routine of religious service for self awareness (Nichiren Shoshu Sect) is to read and learn Hoben-bon of Myoho Renge-kyo Sutra (Skillfulness, chapter 2 of the Lotus Sutra), Nyoraijuryo-hon (Duration of the Life of the Tathagata, chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra) (in chogo (prose) style, also known as Jigage), intone the Nichiren chant (to chant 'Namu Myohorenge-kyo') and they are proceeded with the ancient custom of 5 morning services and 3 evening services.
Tozan sankei' to branch temples and sohonzan (to visit sohonzan Taiseki-ji Temple) is considered as one of the training and to accumulate kudoku (merit) to become a Buddha.
To register in the list of supporters of Nichiren Shoshu Sect, one needs to have jukai (handing down the precepts) at branch temples, furthermore, you need to be issued with the principal image of Great Mandala.
The people who just received jukai but without issue of the principle image, are called naitoku (内得) believers and are not counted in the numbers of official believers.
In any case, all believers of Nichiren Shoshu Sect receive jukai while they are alive.
But in Myokanko group, 'believers who just received jukai can be counted as official numbers of the believers.'
Traditionally, other schools of Nichiren Sect criticize the Sect such as, the theory of 'imitation of the principle image (Nichiren Shoshu Sect)', one of 'Nika Sojo are forged documents,' and one of 'Sandaihiho-sho (Commentary of the Three Great Secret Dharmas) are a forged document theory.'
However, as it is said the Honmon Kaidan no Daigohonzon (the principle image of Nichiren Shoshu Sect) are dwelled the soul of Nichiren Daishonin, the scientific judgment of radiation was never being used, and the originals of the Nika Sojo or Sandaihiho-sho do not exist nowadays, there is no answer to the dispute which has been around for over seven hundred years.
Honmon Kaidan no Daigohonzon has evidences of tools in the Kamakura period, however, it was possibly made in later years since the Nichiren Sect while Nichiren was alive wasn't able to afford the cost, the flower stamp was different from Nichiren's, and it was very similar to Zenshi juyo mandala (Mandala given by Zenshi), and so on.
As for Sandaihiho-sho, a research group including Zuiei ITO, a monk of Nichiren Sect, are almost certain that it is Shinseki (original handwriting) after having computer analysis.
Nika Sojo is also said to be true within Nichiren Sect, especially among monks who are in the Fujimon School line.
On the other hand, there was the insistence to appoint the political power as gathered into the center, or to believe it would definitely come back to Hoshu himself after the conflict between Shoshinkai (correct faith association) or Soka Gakkai.
However on the Nichiren Shoshu Sect side, they insisted that the above insistence cannot be realistic.
The reason being that hoshu can secure to make decisions objectively when the relationship of Hoshu and other monks are shown in documents like Nikko Yuikai Okibumi (Nikko's last admonitions).
There is a background for criticism of the above, on the contrary to many traditional religious schools in Japanese Buddhism who tried to democratize the nature of the religious group by going through trial and error in the movement of 'modernization from the base' after the 1970's, however, Nichiren Shoshu Sect has a tendency to traditionally focus political power on one person, kancho, and maintains the centralization of power.
There are more arguments for and against than before towards the original theory of Butsubachi (Buddha's punishment) and the theory of death.
In another words, the sales talk such as if someone does not join into the group, when he or she dies, the body will turn to an all black color and become heavy, or the scientific and historical criticisms in relation to their own religious group are not acceptable, however when attacking other religious groups baldy, this group is criticized in that they draw a strict line between others and have an exclusive attitude towards them.
In the past other religions were considered as hobo and bad religions, and they tried to teach right things against these religions.
In that sense the Nichiren Shoshu Sect is against other religions.
But the founder of the Sect stated that to teach right things against other religions had to be done with common sense and good manners, and it is only limited to educational differences in the religions.
Therefore, there is only Sokka Gakkai that has what is currently called 'dispute' (conflict apart from doctrine) against Nichiren Shoshu Sect.
Since Sokka Gakkai was excommunicated in 1990 (the official year of excommunication was in the following year, 1991), they spent much time and energy attacking Nichiren Shoshu Sect, and their point of view is that it is important to 'attack the opposition to Buddha,' and they repeatedly wrote slander and gossip or invasion of human rights in their in-house magazines such as the Seikyo newspaper, and there is repeated severe slander towards the high priest including former Hoshu, Nikken.
Also they filed many suits against Nichiren Shoshu Sect although they knew they would lose the cases; the purpose of doing this was to impart human and financial damage to Nichiren Shoshu Sect.
Another thing was that Soka Gakkai believers caused criminal incidents, and they were arrested twice at Hosho-ji Temple in Yokosuka City when they were caught in the act of starting or causing fires.
However, this kind of violent attack has relatively calmed down recently, but they sometimes send spies, or they are scared of spies and watch people coming in and out of temples of Shoshu Sect.
In Taiwan, Nikken, kancho, was introduced as 'hanaosho priest' (sensual monk) in various media such as newspapers and television by a press, mainly organized by gaishojin (immigrant from China Continent to Taiwan after 1945).
But this press is known for publishing critical articles with a sharp tongue about Soka Gakkai.
In Malaysia only monks of this religious school in the Buddhist group are allowed to be stationed in the country.
In France, there was a report on the official name of 'Nichiren Shoshu Sect' (Soka Gakkai) as a sect submitted to the National Assembly in the 1980's, however it was revised to Soka Gakkai International in new report in 1996, the decision was made after the consideration of separating Nichiren Shoshu Sect and Soka Gakkai, but there is a group exist in one part of private group insisting Nichiren Shoshu Sect as sect, same as Soka Gakkai.
It was reported in an official organ of Soka Gakkai, 'Soka Shinpo' that in Argentina, Mother Teresa was told that Nichiren Shoshu Sect was the only appropriate religion and others are not, and this was considered as criticizing other religions, or after they conducted an opening ceremony for a propagation office without gaining approval from the government, and the group lost the license to be a corporate body and the monks were forced to leave the country; currently, the propagation office held the opening ceremony and the activities of the temples are continuing.
With the background indicated above, there was a misunderstanding due to the actions of the Argentinean Soka Gakkai, and their religious activity was suspended for one year due to the order from the prime minister, however they managed to 'avoid losing the license to be a corporate body and suspension of religious activity' since the interim order was accepted by a local court.
In Europe, Nichiren Shoshu Sect is only known as a parental association of Soka Gakkai.
In Europe, Soka Gakkai is generally considered as the same as Nichiren Buddhism.
Since Soka Gakkai was being considered as part of a religious cult, it was exaggerated that the organization was not part of the religious cult.
There is criticism when all other religious schools are said to be not the right religion.

Ninkan (birth date unknown - 1114) was the founder of the Tachikawa School (Esoteric Buddhism).
He later changed his name to Rennen.
Ninkan was born as the eldest son of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) MINAMOTO no Toshifusa of the Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).
His uncle MINAMOTO no Akifusa held the position of Udaijin (Minister of the Right) and was progenitor of the Koga-Genji (Minamoto clan), his aunt FUJIWARA no Kenshi (Kataiko) was the consort of Emperor Shirakawa and the mother of Emperor Horikawa.
His elder brother Shogaku was the founder of the Daigo Sanbo-in School, the largest of the six most prominent schools (Six Schools of Ono) of Shingon Sect Shugendo (mountain asceticism).
Ninkan enthusiastically studied the teachings of the Shingon Sect under Shokaku and ascended to the highest Shingon Sect rank of Ajari.
He was also appointed gojiso (personal Buddhist monk) of Imperial Prince Sukehito (third son of Emperor Gosanjo) who supported the Murakami-Genji.
After Emperor Gosanjo abdicated the throne in favor of his first son, Imperial Prince Sadahito (who later became Emperor Shirakawa) in 1073, he expressed that he wished Imperial Prince Sukehito to be made emperor following his death.
However, the then enthroned Emperor Shirakawa violated this will and installed his own son Imperial Prince Taruhito (who later became Emperor Horikawa) as emperor while himself exerting cloistered rule.
Following the premature death of Emperor Horikawa, the then 5 year old Imperial Prince Munehito (who later became Emperor Toba) was enthroned.
This exclusion of Imperial Prince Sukehito caused the Murakami-Genji to become increasingly dissatisfied.
In 1113, Ninkan, who believed that Imperial Prince Sukehito should be made emperor, planned to assassinate Emperor Toba.
However, the plot was discovered before it could be carried out.
The testimony boy named Senjumaru, whose role it was to carry out the assassination, led to the Ninkan's arrest and confession following questioning.
In November of the same year, Nikkan was exiled to Ohito in Izu (Senjumaru Incident).
After being exiled to Izu, Ninkan changed his name to Rennen and worked to spread Shingon teachings.
It was during this period that he met Onmyoji (practitioner of Yin and Yang divination) named Kenren from Tachikawa, Musashi Province,
In addition to Kenren, he took other disciples including Kanren, Jakujo and Kansho who he instructed in the secrets of the Daigo Sanbo-in School.
In March 1114, he committed suicide by throwing himself from the peak of Mt. Jo.
It is believed that his teachings were disseminated by his disciples to form the Tachikawa School.
Details remain unclear as the majority of the documents relating to the Tachikawa School were lost during the subsequent suppression of the school.
This is also true of details pertaining to Ninkan, and there remain points of uncertainty in description of his life given above.
Refer to the article entitled 'Tachikawa School (Esoteric Buddhism)' for more details.
The E Ingakyo is one manuscript of the "Kako Genzai Inga-kyo Sutra" (one of the sutras representing the life-story of the Buddha) with transcribed sutras in the lower half of the Kansubon (book in scroll style) as well as illustrations in the upper half depicting the contents of the sutra, and it is believed to be the origin of emakimono (picture scrolls) which spread nationwide from the time of the Heian period.
The E Ingakyo was compiled to pass down the life of Buddha in an accessible way by adding illustrations to "Kako Genzai Ingakyo Sutra," which is a biography of Buddha describing events stretching from his good conduct in his previous life to his spiritual enlightenment in this.
Two types of E Ingakyo remain, one produced in the Nara period and the other in the Kamakura period.
The former is called 'Ko-Ingakyo Sutra' (old Ingakyo Sutra), and is regarded as an important document for the study of pictures in the Nara period as very few illustrations remain from this era.
The style, with the sutra transcribed in the lower half of the Kansubon together with illustrations depicting the sutra painted in the upper half, originated in China, and this has been proved by the archaeological finds of Dun Huang which show their similarity.
Although the E Ingakyo is widely believed to have been influential in the development of emakimono, there is some doubt whether the E Ingakyo had a direct relationship with the emakimono produced abundantly from the Heian period, because the painting style of the E Ingakyo is extremely antique and simple.
Products remaining from the Nara period include Kansubon owned by the Tokyo University of Arts (National Treasure), Kansubon owned by Jobonrendai-ji Temple in Kyoto (National Treasure), Kansubon owned by Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto (National Treasure) and Kansubon owned by the Idemitsu Museum of Arts in Tokyo (Important Cultural Property).
The "Kako Genzai Ingakyo Sutra" is a set of sutras in four volumes, while E Ingakyo consists of eight scrolls in total as each volume of "Kako Genzai Ingakyo Sutra" has two scrolls, depicting the first and second halves.
However, each Kansubon owned by the above-mentioned facilities is only a single scroll out of the eight.
There are also subtle differences in the painting style of each piece, indicating that each Kansubon belonged to separate sets of manuscript.
Fujimon School is one of the generic names for numbers of honzan temples (head temples) and their branch temples in Nichiren Sect, which succeed the dharma lineage of Nikko, who was one of 6 high-caliber disciples of Nichiren.
There are also Nikkomon School, Taisekiji School, and so on, as the old generic names used in and from the medieval period and the early-modern period.
They once formed a unified sect in the Meiji period, and after that, going through splits and uniting with the Nichiren Sect, from 8 major honzan temples of Fujimon School, 5 of them formed an independent sect, starting with Nichiren Sho Sect, and 3 of them, belonging to the Nichiren Sect as an organization, kept Nichiren Honbutsu Ron (a creed which regard Nichiren as the principal image) of Shoretsu School, which is a tradition in this monryu (lineage).
They belong to the Shoretsu School, which divides their dependent sutra, twenty-eight chapters of Hokke-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra), into two and call the first half 'Shakumon' and the second half 'Honmon,' and regard the master secrets of the Hokke-kyo Sutra to be included in Honmon.
(Against this, a school which regards the twenty-eight chapters to be handled as unified sutra is called 'Icchi School').
They regard Nichiren as 'Kuon no Honbutsu' (eternal principal image).

In old days they called themselves Fujimon School, Nikkomon School, and Taiseki-ji School, and even though they did not form a strong unified organization like that seen in the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), they were connected loosely through personal and academic exchanges.
After the Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism) which followed the Meiji Restoration, the Meiji government came out with Isshu-Ikkancho system (a system in which each sect was allowed only one chief abbot) against every Buddhist sect, and in 1872, a number of schools which had Nichiren as the founder formed the Nichiren Sect.
At first, in 1874, this Nichiren Sect was split into Icchi School and Shoretsu School, and Fujimon School belonged to Shoretsu School.
Further in 1876, from the discrepancies of creed and monryu, Shoretsu School of Nichiren Sect was dissolved, and Fujimon School organized Honmon Sect as a unified religious community, which was formed by honzan temples and their branch temples of Komon Hachi Honzan.
Its shumuin (office for religious management) were put in Omosu Honmon-ji Temple and its organizational systems, such as the selection of the head of the sect in rotations of Hachi Honzan, were arranged, and in 1899, it changed its name to Honmon Sect.
However in 1900, Taiseki-ji Temple and its eighty-seven branch temples separated as Fuji School of Nichiren Sect, and in June 1912, changed its name to Nichiren Sho Sect and has kept its form until the present day.
In 1941, the authority pressured a number of Buddhist schools with the same founder to be unified, and 9 schools of the Nichiren Sect were unified in to 4 schools.
As for Fujimon School, Nichiren Sho Sect kept its independence, but Honmon Sect, along with Kenpon Hokke Sect and Nichiren Sect, carried out 'Sanpa Godo' (3 joined sects).
In 1945, by the end of the war, the demand for unity disappeared, but 7 honzan temples and their former branch temples of Fujimon School did not regain their independence as a unified sect,
Twelve temples, including 3 honzan temples, Omosu Honzan-ji Temple, Koizumi Kuon-ji Temple, and Izu Jitsujo-ji Temple, their former branch temples, and the former branch temples of Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple, kept their 'Godo.'
Yoho-ji Temple and about fifty branch temples belonging to it became independent from Nichiren Sect as Nichiren Hon Sect in 1950.
Thirty-four former branch temples kept 'Godo' and remained in Nichiren Sect.
Myoren-ji Temple (Fujinomiya City) and its former 6 branch temples joined Nichiren Sho Sect in December 1950.
Former 1 branch temple kept 'Godo' and remained in Nichiren Sect.
Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple joined Nichiren Sho Sect alone by honzan temple itself in March 1957.
Later became an independent religious corporation.
Hota Myohon-ji Temple and its former 4 branch temples joined Nichiren Sho Sect in April 1957.
In 1993, Hota Myohon-ji Temple became an independent religious corporation.
Former 9 branch temples kept 'Godo' and remained in Nichiren Sect.
Omosu Honmon-ji Temple, which was former sohonzan (grand head temple) of Honmon Sect with shumuin, is counted as one of the 7 grand honzan temples of Nichiren Sect, and with other honzan temples and branch temples of Fujimon School, keeps its original creed as Nikkomon School inside the Nichiren Sect, which has Icchi School and Shaka Honbutsu Ron (creed which regards Shaka as the principal image) as its mainstream.

Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Higashi Hongan-ji school is a school of the Jodo Shinshu consisting of more than 300 branch temples and respected temples which separated from the Shinshu sect Otani school containing around 10,000 branch temples.
The head temple is Higashi Hongan-ji Temple in Taito Ward, Tokyo Metropolitan Area.
The leader of the religious school is called Hossu (high priest), and the present Hossu is the 26th Hossu Koken OTANI (also called Monnyo).
History
Within the Shinshu sect Otani school whose head temple was Shinshu-honbyo Mausoleum, there was a confrontation between conservatives and reformists over several issues such as differences in the interpretation of doctrine and the direction of the movement, which developed into a theological dispute called Ohigashi-sodo Strife in 1969.
Opposing the reformist group, the 24th Hossu Kocho OTANI (also called Sennyo) broke off the existing comprehensive relationship with Shinshu sect Otani school in 1978 with the aim of protecting the traditions of Buddhism, and declared that he would move to realize the independence of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture.
He simultaneously appealed to the quasi head temples and branch temples all over Japan to leave Shinshu sect Otani school.
In concert with this appeal, Kocho's eldest son Kosho (also called Konyo) OTANI, the Hoshi (successor of principle, also called Shinmon) of Shinshu sect Otani school, promoted the separation of Tokyo Hongan-ji Temple (also called Asakusa Monzeki Temple), a branch temple of Shinshu sect Otani school in Tokyo, at which he had once worked as a chief priest, with the result that the separation was certified on June 15, 1981.
However, obstructing the separation plan for Higashi Hongan-ji Temple encouraged by Kosho OTANI, the reformist group expedited the revision of the 'Constitution of Shinshu sect Otani school' and promulgated a new constitution which came into force on June 11, 1981.
Following the new constitution, the reformist group abolished the position of 'Hossu,' effectively the Shishu (leader) who had passed down the tradition of Buddhism particular to Hongan-ji Temple since its establishment by the founder of the sect, Shinran Shonin, and instead established a new position of 'Monshu' (chief priest), which was regarded as a symbol of integration between sects and which lacked authority, and attempted to install Kocho OTANI in the position, however Kocho rejected the promotion.
Furthermore, adopting the idea of 'Shu-hon Ittai' (which means the sect and head temple are undivided and united), the reformist group legally dissolved the religious corporation 'Honganji' (meaning Higashi Hongan-ji Temple), which had maintained an intricate relationship with the religious corporation 'Shinshu Otani ha' (the Shinshu sect Otani school), in order to merge the two bodies on December 14, 1987.
Following this, the official name of 'Shinshu-honbyo' (Shinshu-honbyo mausoleum) was given to Higashi-Hongan-ji temple.
).
Reflecting on these circumstances, Kosho declared on February 29, 1988 that he would succeed as the 25th Hossu of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple, saying that he would inherit the tradition of Buddhism belonging to Hongan-ji Temple which had been made defunct due to changes in the rules of Shinshu sect Otani school.
At the same time, he formed 'Jodo Shinshu sect Higashi Hongan-ji school,' containing more than 300 temples separated from Shinshu sect Otani school, choosing Tokyo Hongan-ji Temple as the head temple.
Afterwards, he formalized the religious regulations and charter in 1996, as well as establishing the 'branch temple' system.
After the death of Kosho in 1999, his eldest son Koken (also called Monnyo) succeeded as the 26th Hossu and changed the name of the head temple 'Tokyo Hongan-ji Temple' into 'Jodo Shinshu sect Higashi Hongan-ji school, Honzan Higashi, Hongan-ji Temple' on April 26, 2001.
The Nichiren Honmon Sect (Also known as Honmon Sect) is a sect based on Nichiren Buddhism, which was organized by Nikkomon School (a branch temple succeeding the Nikko's Buddhist teaching lineage) in 1876, and merged with the Nichiren Sect and the Kenpon Hokke Sect in 1941 in order to form a better organization.
As for the doctrine, the sect believed Shoretsu School, Shuso Honbutsuron (believing Nichiren as the True Buddha).
History
It was established as the Komon School of Nichiren Sect in 1876 by eight head temples and their branch temples that belonged to the Fujimon School.
Its name was changed to The Nichiren Honmon Sect (Honmon Sect) in 1899.
The Taiseki-ji Temple and its branch temples separated from the school and became independent as the Fuji School of the Nichiren Sect in 1900, and it was changed into Nichiren Sho Sect in 1912.
In 1941, it was united with the Kenpon Hokke Sect of Shoretsu School and the Nichiren Sect of Icchi School in order to form the better organization, the Nichiren Sect, which was composed of major and branch temples of various schools of Shoretsu School and Icchi School.

Hatto is a construction in a Buddhist temple where priests make lectures about Buddhism.
The word 'hatto' is used in temples of the Zen sect, and in other sects, it is usually called kodo.
The establishment of hatto was in China, not India, and it is believed that it had already been established in the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (China), when Buddhism began to spread through the noble class.
It is one of the most important constructions that form Buddhist temples, along with towers to enshrine Buddha's ashes and butsuden (kondo), where Buddha statues are enshrined, and in Japan, the location of each structure differs in each period, but it is usually placed in the center of the temple, because it came to be positioned as the most important construction, next to butsuden.
The head priest and lecturing priests make lectures about Buddhist scriptures and preachings against Buddhists and other priests, and especially in the Zen sect, it is called 'Jodo Seppo' to make preachings up on the hoseki (seat for preachers), and the contents of the preachings, which are called jodogo, are recorded in goroku (collection of quotations) such as 'Rinzai Roku' (the record of Rinzai's teachings).
Further, kodo in present day in schools are usually used as gyms, and so on.
Also in universities, when placed as a room in buildings for normal classes, it is sometimes called kogishitsu (teaching room) and daikyoshitsu (great classroom).
Takuhatsu (pindapata in Sanskrit) is one of the forms of ascetic practice for monks of Ancient Indian religions, including Buddhism and Jainism, and it is an ascetic practice to make monks go around the homes of believers, beg for the least amount of food and so on required, and let the believers earn merit.
It is also called kotsujikigyo, zudagyo, or gyokotsu.
Because monks in religions in Ancient India usually deny desires for possessions, they only possess sanne-ippatsu (three robes and one begging bowl), bare necessities, and they do not engage in productive activities such as agriculture in order to devote to ascetic practices.
Because of this, monks needed to supply the least amount of food required to maintain their bodies from believers other than the monks, and under such a situation, exchanges between monks, who are usually involved in ascetic practices in mountains and woods and do not relate much to other people, and believers who live in towns and villages were born.
Arakan, which is one of the names for those that practice asceticism in Buddhism and other religions in Ancient India, is a transcription of Arhat in Sanskrit, which means 'a person who deserves to receive a offerings' shown in Chinese translation 'ogu,' and also, biku (Buddhist priest) is a transcription for Sanskrit bhiksu, which means 'begging person.'
However, on the other hand, 'people who only beg for food' (pindola) were seen as vulgar people by lay believers.
As a result, even though they had similar activities, those that did not possess personality as monks could not receive offerings from lay believers.
Takuhatsu was also introduced into Buddhism, which is one of the Ancient Indian religions.
Takuhatsu is still practiced in the present day, in the year 2006, in Theravada Buddhism of Southeast Asia.
Nowadays, takuhatsu is practiced every morning, and the foods taken back to the religious community are divided equally between everyone by those in charge.
In "Hokkukyo Sutra" (Words of Truth, Dhammapada), an anecdote is recorded that Brahman (priest of Hinduism, members of the highest caste) challenged Shaka to a debate, who was practicing takuhatsu, and instead, was influenced by Shaka to be a lay believer.
Takuhatsu was also introduced to Japan from China and the Korean Peninsula along with Buddhism.
In the Nara period, Gyoki and others practiced takuhatsu in a form of kanjin (temple solicitation) to prepare social infrastructure such as embankments for rivers and maintenance of wells and reservoirs, and to erect the Great Buddha, which also had the meaning of charity.
Takuhatsu in this kind of situation also had the meaning of publicity along with the collection of funds, so it was practiced not only in their neighborhood but also in distant places.
These takuhatsu in distant places led to propagation of the Jodo (Pure Land) Sect by wanderers called hijiri, such as Kuya, at the end of Heian period.
On November 9, 1872, Takuhatsu was banned (ordinance No. 25 of Kyobusho (the Ministry of Religion)).
The ban was removed on 15 August, 1881 (ko dai 8 go (ordinance No. 8 of the first part) of the Ministry of Interior), but a license given by the chief abbot needed to be carried.
Takuhatsu in present days practices in two manners; that of visiting homes of supporters of the sect in groups, and that of begging for almsgiving by standing without moving in front of gates of temples and on the crossings of busy streets by individuals.
Further, it is common to assume that police permission to use roads based on the Road Traffic Act is not required for takuhatsu.
As seen above, takuhatsu in Buddhism in Japan lost its original purpose, because Mahayana Buddhism that spread in Eastern Asia including Japan, being different from Theravada Buddhism, does not prohibit the possession of articles, and as a result, it became possible to maintain temples by the rent paid by tenant farmers in the management of contributed manors and others, and there was no more need for takuhatsu for the purpose of maintenance.
Kyonyo (6 November, 1558 - 6 November, 1614) the twelfth chief priest of the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.
His imina (personal name) was Koju.
He was the first son of eleventh chief priest, Kennyo.
He was engaged to a daughter of Yoshikage ASAKURA, but it was broken off.
When the Ishiyama War broke out against Nobunaga ODA in 1570, he helped his father and fought exhaustively against Nobunaga.
But in 1580, his father tried to leave Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple after the violent attacks by Nobunaga, accepting the Imperial order by Emperor Ogimachi to make peace.
Kyonyo claimed to resist to the last and fought against Nobunaga ignoring the Imperial order for peace and shutting himself in Hongan-ji Temple, and was disowned by his father.
After that, he wandered through many regions such as Yamato Province, Omi Province, Kii Province, Yamashiro Province, Settsu Province, and Aki Province.
In 1582, when Nobunaga died in the Honnoji Incident, he reconciled with his father.
After Kennyo died in 1592, his first son Kyonyo tried to succeed the chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple, but Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI opposed the succession by Kyonyo with the reasons that he was once disowned by his father, he resisted exhaustively against Nobunaga in the past, and so on, and appointed Junnyo, his half-brother, as the successor.
Because of this, Kyonyo could not succeed to his father's position.
However, when Ieyasu TOKUGAWA came into power after Hideyoshi's death, because of the reason that Ieyasu was once troubled by the Ikko Sect, he started to intervene in the quarrel between Kyonyo and Junnyo.
Ieyasu came to support Kyonyo, and after experiencing espionage on the night before the Battle of Sekigahara (it was sensed by the Mitsunari ISHIDA side and was encountered in such a dangerous situation that he had written a farewell poem, but with the help of Hidenobu ODA and others and hard fighting by his followers, he at last returned to Kyoto), he erected Shinshu-honbyo Mausoleum in Karasuma in Shichijo in Kyoto in 1602, with Imperial sanction from the Emperor Goyozei in the background.
Because of this, Hongan-ji Temple in Shichijo Horikawa, succeed by Junnyo, came to be called Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, and the religious community of Hongan-ji Temple was split into East and West.
In 1614, he died at the age of 57.
Tokudo is a ceremony in Buddhism to enter into priesthood.
Originally, everyone could become a priest if he had the approval of ten senior members of Buddhist society (sanshi-shichisho (three leaders and seven witnesses) and an oath to obey religious precepts, but because they were exempted from labors, tax payments, and military service in China and in Japan, many people became priests one after the other and developed into a situation threatening the national finances.
Therefore, to limit the number of people who became priests every year and in the regions, government created the tokudo as a national license system.
After Buddhism originated in India was introduced to China, it had to be taken control of by the government, in addition to its original Buddhist religious precepts.
Zanning of Northern Sung mentioned in the chapter 'Soseki Shicho' (tensioning and loosening of priesthood) of his writing "The Essential History of Great-Song Monks" as follows.
Originally, Buddhism had no reason to be controlled by the government, but because not only those that seek the truth, but also those who envy the elegance and gracefulness of a priest's life, and those that wished to escape from labor by entering the priesthood, increased so much, it became impossible for Buddhist precepts alone to restrain evil customs, and government thus started to take control by the establishment of priest officials and registration of priests and priestess.
Indeed in China, since the special privilege of exemption from labor was given to priests, many priests with the purpose of exemption from labor appeared, and because of that, the government established various restraining policies and regulations, such as limiting the numbers of priests receiving tokudo.
Further, the priests officially recognized by the government were forced to become organized in priesthood, and this accelerated the control by the government.
Simultaneously, official certificates as priests who were officially recognized by the government were issued by the government, and its control was further strengthened.
In ancient times in Japan, it meant to join priesthood with tonsure under the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the Ritsuryo code).
There were nenbundo, which approved fixed numbers of tokudo each year, and rinjido (approved tokudo on special occasions), and generally, the number of tokudo approved were limited to ten.
Both were officially approved by passing examinations.
The ones that were approved were issued an official certificate to prove the tokudo by government, and after the priestly teacher of the approved person guaranteed his name, age, and place where his family was officially registered, signed by officials and priests of Genbaryo and Jibusho (both ministries to manage diplomacy and registration of monks), it was provided with a seal by Daijokan (Grand Council of State).
As those that were approved had the privilege to be exempted from labor, farmers who became priests without official approvals were appeared, that was called shido, and priests by shido, called shidoso, were prohibited by Kokonritsu (Penal Law on Households and Marriage) and Soniryo (Regulations for Monks and Nuns), which were both part of Ritsuryo code.
Also, rinjido were hold in the occasions such as a shortage of priests in official temples, praying for restoration from illness and so on to nobilities such as the Emperor, and helping nobilities, who were permitted to approve fixed number of tokudo as an award by the government to nobilities, to accumulate good deeds.
However, even when the priest was shidoso, that person seems to be treated with tolerance when he has made proper ascetic practices and activities as a priest.
In article of September 11, 758 of "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicles of Japan, Continued), there is writing about tokudo approved to 'seiko isshi' (清行逸士) in various regions around the country, who have accumulated ascetic practices for more than ten years hiding in mountains and forests.
It does use the expression 'seiko isshi' (ones with pure actions), but it shows the fact that sometimes shidoso, even though making ascetic practices without an official certificate, were not punished, but were even approved as monks.
After that, in writings such as Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories), there are articles that are mentioned again and again about the examinations held to approve tokudo to ones that make ascetic practices, and it is believed that many of those examinees were shidoso.
Shidoso was illegal and was an object to be regulated, but actually, it is believed that there were two different policies; on the one hand, strict regulations were made against those that became shidoso for the purpose of exemption from labor, but on the other hand, to some extent, those that held actual activities as monks were approved, and those that had excellent results were not objects to be punished, but rather were objects to be approved as tokudo and actively taken into the system.
Further, there are Kukai, Encho (a leading disciple of Saicho), Kyokai (the author of "Nihon Ryoiki" (Miraculous Stories from the Japanese Buddhist Tradition, written in the early Heian period)), and so on as the ones that succeeded as shidoso.
Nika Sojo are documents which were believed to be addressed from Nichiren to his disciple, Nikko, in 1282.
They are regarded as documents that approved Nikko as the successor of each and every teaching by Nichiren (So-fuzokusho (total document for entrustment)) and decided Nikko as the chief priest of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu (Betsu-fuzokusho).
They are called Nika Sojo since there are 2 ('ni', in Japanese) documents, and from the place it was written, they are also called 'Minobu Sojo' and 'Ikegami Sojo' respectively.
Originally, those were handed down to Omosu Honmon-ji Temple (Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple), but presently, there are no original copies by Nichiren, and only manuscripts are handed down to Yobo-ji Temple in Kyoto, Taiseki-ji Temple in Fuji, Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple, and so on.
Also, many different manuscripts exist.
Minobu Sojo, from its contents, is also called Nichiren Ichigo Guho Fuzokusho (document entrusting Nichiren's lifetime preachings) and Sofuzokusho.
It is written that it was composed at Mt. Minobu right before Nichiren departed from Minobu, and is called Minobu Sojo.
Nichiren departed from Minobu for a hot spring cure, and on his way, he stopped at Ikegami, and died at there.
Ikegami Sojo is called that since it was written at the time of his death at Ikegami (Ikegami Honmon-ji Temple).
Also from the description as the betto (chief priest) of Minobu Kuon-ji Temple, it is also called Minobusan Fuzokusho (document for entrustment of Mt. Minobu) and Betsu-fuzokusho.
The date on Minobu Sojo is September 13, but in Ganso Kado Ki (biography of Nichiren), it is written that he had departed from Minobu-sawa stream on September 8, so that he could not be at Mt. Minobu on September 13.
From this date, some people point out that Nika Sojo are forged documents.
Further, Nika Sojo are regarded as fake documents since there are no records in ancient times, but according to Fuji Taiseki-ji Temple, there is a document by Niccho, who was one of roku roso (the Six Senior Disciples of Nichiren), called Honzon Sho Tokui Sho Soegaki (The Covering Letter of "Kanjin Honzon Sho" (the Spiritual Contemplation and the Most Venerable One)), written in the twenty-seventh year after Nichiren's death.
On November 19, 1308, it is described as follows in Honzon Sho Tokui Sho Soegaki.
By this entrustment of Nichiren's lifetime preaching, Nikko directly inherited the Buddhist teachings by the head of the sect Nichiren, and it is time that you should stop learning by yourself and spread the teachings to people as the second coming of Muhengyo Bosatsu (Boundless Practices) in Mappo (latter days of Buddhism) (Nichiren Shu Shugaku Zensho (the Complete Works of Nichiren Sect), volume 1).
However, in many articles which are regarded as having been written by Nichiren, the head of the sect is assumed as Shakyamuni, and since in Honzon Shoto Tokui Sho Soegaki it is written as the head of the sect Nichiren, it is pointed out that it was written in later years.
In 1350, it is described as follows in Saijarissho Sho (Commentary written by Nichijun about the principle images of kuge (court nobles) and samurai families).
Of edifying honzon written by Nichiren, there was Byakuren Ajari (a master in esoteric Buddhism) and so on written on the card granted to Nikko.
(Nichiren Shu Shugaku Zensho, volume 2)
This is not Nika Sojo itself, but it can be seen that there was some kind of a document of entrustment.
The disciples of Nichiren called his teachings ho (Buddhism), and called the proper inheritance of these teachings sojo, fuzoku, fuho, and so on.
It is also called Yuiju Ichinin Kechimyaku Sojo (only one person to inherit the blood) and Chaku Chaku Fufo (legitimate inheritance), and regard it as the basis for the assertion of Nikko as the legitimacy.
Strictly speaking, Nika Sojo and Kechimyaku Sojo are different things.
However, the assertion of Nikkomon School, which argues that only Nikko has inherited the teachings, is not accepted by other schools of Nichiren Sect.
Nikkobon (book by Nikko)
November 6, 1468
Nikko, the tenth chief priest of Juhon-ji Temple, transcribed the whole Nika Sojo at Omosu.
It is at Yobo-ji Temple in Kyoto.

The contents of Nikkobon can not be confirmed since it is not open to the public, but it is believed that since Nikkyo, who is introduced below, was also from Yobo-ji Temple, that Nikkobon has the same contents as Nikkyobon (book by Nikkyo).
Nikkyobon
In 1482, Nikkyo (日叶) of Juhon-ji Temple submitted to Taiseki-ji Temple and changed his name to Nikkyo (日教).
There are 2 books that are called Nikkyobon, and the contents of Minobu Sojo and Ikegami Sojo is replaced by each other.
Hyakugojikkajo (Hundred and Fifty Articles)
In 1480, Nikkyo of Juhon-ji Temple wrote 'Hyakugojikkajo' and quoted Nika Sojo in the book.
Minobu Sojo
The lifetime preachings of Nichiren were entrusted to Byakuren Ajari Nikko, and he should become a great preacher to spread honmon (second half of 28 chapters of Lotus Sutra), if the lord of the province respects these teachings, Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) of Honmon-ji Temple should be constructed at Mt. Fuji, and you should only wait, this is the Kaiho (religious precepts in Buddhism), and especially our disciples should obey this document.
In October (blank), 1282, lineage of Nichiren and Nikko, written at Mt. Hakii in Kai Province.
Ikegami Sojo
Fifty years of preaching by Shakyamuni should be entrusted to Byakuren Ajari Nikko, he should become the betto of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu, and all the lay believers and monks who are against this should be regarded as ones that are against the Buddhist teachings.
November 21, 1282, honorable seal by Nichiren, Ikegami in Bushu (Musashi Province).
Ruiju Kanshushi ("My Personal Views" written by Nikkyo)
In 1488, Nikkyo wrote 'Ruiju Kanshushi' and quoted Nika Sojo there.
Minobu Sojo
Fifty years of preaching by Shakyamuni is entrusted to Byakuren Nikko, he should become the betto of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu, and lay believers and monks who are against this are regarded as people who are against the teachings of Buddhism.
November 21, 1282, honorable seal by Nichiren, lineage of Nichiren Nikko, written at Mt. Hakii in Kai Province.
Ikegami Sojo
The lifetime preachings of Nichiren are entrusted to Byakuren Ajari Nikko, he should become a great preacher to spread honmon, if the lord of the province respects these teachings, he should construct Kaidan of Honmon-ji Temple at Mt. Fuji, and he should wait, this is the so-called Kaiho, and especially our disciples should obey this document.
In October (blank), 1282, honorable seal by Nichiren.
Rokunin Ryugi Haryu Shoshiki (literally, Commentary on proposition of six people)
In 1489, Nikkyo wrote 'Rokunin Ryugi Haryu Shoshiki' and quoted Nika Sojo there.
Minobu Sojo
Fifty years of Shakyamuni's preaching is entrusted to Byakuren Nikko, he should become the betto of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu, and lay believers and monks who are against this should be regarded as those that are against Buddhist teachings.
November 21, 1282, honorable seal by Nichiren, lineage of Nichiren Nikko, this is written in the mountain at Hakii-go Village of Kai Province.
Ikegami Sojo
The lifetime preachings of Nichiren are entrusted to Byakuren Ajari Nikko, he should become a great preacher to spread honmon, if the lord of the province respects these teachings he should construct Kaidan of Honmon-ji Temple at Mt. Fuji, and he should wait, this is the so-called Kaiho, and especially our disciples should obey this document.
October (blank), 1282, honorable seal by Nichiren
Nichigenbon (book by Nichigen)
In 1516, Nichigen, the 8th chief priest of Echigo Honjo-ji Temple, quoted the whole Nika Sojo in 'Gonin Shoha Shoshaku' and further wrote as follows.
Nichigen says, the first sojo (October 22) is Minobu Sojo, and the second one (November 21) is Ikegami Sojo and so on.
The honorable seal is a original one.
However, the handwriting is not by Nichiren, and it seems to be forged.
Also, it is not the handwriting of Nikko, either, and I hear that it is similar to the handwriting of a person called Kurodo Ajari Nichidai.
(Nichiren Shu Shugaku Zensho, volume 7 - 182)
Nikko came down from Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu, received donations from the Nanjo clan, constructed Taiseki-ji Temple but handed this over to Nichimoku, and after 2, 3 years, he constructed Omosu Dansho (Omosu Honmon-ji Temple).
The second chief priest of Omosu was Nichidai.
Nichidai was thrown out from Omosu, later founded Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple, and assumed the position of the first chief priest there.
Also, since there is the name of Nichikaku recorded on the family register of deaths in Nishiyama Honmon-ji Temple, it is supposed that both temples had exchanges with each other.
Nisshinbon (book by Nisshin, also known as Nichiyobon)
It is said to be a transcription of Nika Sojo in Omosu which was ordered to be transcribed by Nisshin in Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple to his disciple Nichiyo in 1556, and exists in Nishyama Honmon-ji Temple.
The characteristics are that the date in Minobu Sojo is written as 'October (blank)' and does not have the date 22, and Mt. Minobu is written as Mt. Mito.
The contents of Nikkobon cannot be confirmed, but since it is written as Mt. Minobu in Nikkyobon which is located at the same temple, Juhon-ji Temple, it is said that Mt. Mito is simply a mistake in transcription.
However, in the transcription by Nisshu, the 14th chief priest of Taiseki-ji Temple (the period as chief: 1573 - 1586), which is handed down in Taiseki-ji Temple, it is written as 'Mt. Mito,' and the Taiseki-ji Temple side assumes that there is a possibility that the original document was written as 'Mt. Mito.'
The transcription by Nisshu is regarded as almost the same as Nisshinbon.
The Loss of Nika Sojo
In April 14, 1581, 300 years after the death of Nichiren, vessels of Katsuyori TAKEDA raided Omosu, and robbed Nika Sojo (Fujishu Gaku Yoshu (Teachings of Nichiren sects), volume 9 - 17 and 20).
Nika Sojo documents were robbed by the army of Katsuyori TAKEDA and were transmitted as being lost in the disturbance by TAKEDA, and books were wrote about the story of Nika Sojo's loss by Nichiga and others in Hota Myohon-ji Temple, but there is a record stating that Ieyasu TOKUGAWA read the Nika Sojo thirty years after the disturbance.
In the Year 1611
Ieyasu, in Sunpu-jo Castle, read Nika Sojo brought from Omosu.
(Sunpu Seijiroku (Records of Sunpu Government) and Sunkoku Zatsushi (Topography of Sunpu), volume 31 - second - 74)
In the Year 1611
Honko Kokushi received Nika Sojo from Doshun (Razan HAYASHI) and wrote it in his diary.
(Bukkyo Zensho (Compendium of Buddhism), Honko Kokushi Nikki (the Honko Kokushi Journal), volume 1 - 165)
In 1617, Nichiyo, the 24th chief priest of Mt. Kanama, went to Omosu and read Nika Sojo.
(Fujishu Gaku Yoshu, volume 5 - 60)
On June 13, 1877, read them at Okazeire (summer airing) at Omosu (Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple).
(Komon Guketsu (Kegi (the way Buddha guides people) of Komon School)
Since the record of Nika Sojo in Omosu after that is not certain, it is also said that they still are concealed in Omosu.
Others
There are documents other than Nika Sojo such as 'Hyaku Rokka Sho' (One Hundred and Six Articles, also known as Kechimyakusho) and 'Honinmyosho' (Honin-myo Sho (On the Mystic Principle of the Original Cause, also known as Hokkehonmonshu Kechimyakusojonokoto (document about the inheritance of blood lineage in Hokke Honmon Sect)), which are also called Ryokan Kechimyaku (blood lineage of two books), but both are criticized by other sects within Nichiren sects that they are fake books.
Daishi is a kind of honorific title in China and in Japan bestowed to priests with high virtue by the Imperial Court, and many of them are okurina (posthumous names).
In China, according to chapter 'Shishigo' (bestowment of title to high virtue monks) in the final volume of "Daiso Soshiryaku" (The Essential History of Great-Sung Monks) by Zanning in the beginning of the Northern Sung Dynasty, the origin is when shigo (title for high virtue priest) 'Sanei Daishi' was Imperially bestowed to Unko of east area of Changan and 'Joko Daishi' was to Sotetsu of west area of Changan in discussion in Engyosetsu (延慶節) on December 10, 870, in the reign of Emperor Iso, in the latter half of the Tang Dynasty.
It means that it regards that there were only Hoshigo (kind of title bestowed to monks with high virtue) and Zenjigo (title given to master of Zen Buddhism) existing before that.
It states that after that, since bestowment of Daishigo (same meaning as Daishi) and shie (purple robe bestowed Imperially) was issued excessively at the end of the Tang Dynasty, a command to prohibit them was officially announced in 921.
It concludes that even at the beginning of the Sung Dynasty, Daishigo was never bestowed until 979.
However, at least in the reign of Shino (King of Jin), an example of Emperor Yodai of Sui Dynasty bestowing the Daishigo 'Chisha' to Zhi-yi when the Emperor had received Bosatsukai (Bodhisattva Precepts) from him can be seen, so actually, the origin of Daishigo can be thought to go back before that time.
In Japan, in August of 866 in the reign of Emperor Seiwa, Daishigo 'Denkyo' and 'Jikaku' were bestowed to Saicho and Ennin respectively, for the first time.

Jetavana Vihara (the formal name is "Jetavana Anathapindadasya-arama" in Sanskrit) was a temple at Sravasti in Middle India, where Buddha preached sermons.
Jetavana Vihara was one of five Shoja (a hall where priests practiced asceticism, with similarities to a temple) in India that existed during Buddha's lifetime.
The name is composed of two elements, 'Jetavana' (a tree-clad land belonging to Prince Jeta) and 'Anathapindada' (to give charity to people with no relatives), and originates from the following episode.
There was a wealthy person named Sudatta in Sravasti, India, who was widely called 'Anathapindada' because he, out of a sense of pity, provided people without a family with food.
After listening to Buddha's sermon one day, Sudatta decided to convert and become a believer and donate to Buddha a temple for preaching.
The land he chose for this was the tree-clad land belonging to Prince Jeta.
In jest Prince Jeta said to Sudatta who asked him to cede the land, 'If you should cover the land with gold coins, I will give it to you.'
On seeing Sudatta starting to spread gold coins, Prince Jeta was so surprised that he not only gave Sudatta the land, but also supported the construction of the temple by donating trees.
Therefore, the land contributed to Buddha was called Jetavana Anathapindada by adopting both of the names of Prince Jeta and Anathapindada Sudatta, and the temple established in the land was called Jetavana Anathapindadasya-arama.
Jetavana Vihara is well-known in Japan from the introduction to "Heike Monogatari" (The Tale of the Heike) which runs 'The sound of the temple bell in Jetavana Vihara echoes as if it is telling us that all things existing in our world are not eternal.'
Moreover, the name of Gion, a famous Hanamachi (entertainment area and geisha district in Kyoto), originates from the fact that the area it covers was a Monzen-machi (temple town) built around Yasaka-jinja Shrine, formerly called Gion-sha Shrine.
The name of Gion-sha Shrine, another name for Yasaka-jinja Shrine, originates from that of Gion-ji Temple, itself another name of Kankei-ji Temple.
Myocho SHUHO (1282 - January 21, 1338) was a priest of Rinzai Sect in the last Kamakura period.
He is generally known as Daito Kokushi.
His imina (personal name) was Myocho and his go (pen name) was Shuho.
He was originally from Harima Province (Hyogo Prefecture).
He was born as a child of Ikkoku URAKAMI, who was a member of the Urakami clan, which was Gozoku (local ruling family) in Urakami no sho Manor in the same Province, and the vassal of the Akamatsu clan, then shugo (provincial constable) of the province.
He was bestowed the title of kokushi (the most reverend priest), Kozen Daito and Kosho Seito, by the Imperial Court.
He was a founder of Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto.
He joined Engyo-ji Temple on Mt. Shosha, a big temple at his birthplace, and started to study teachings of Tendai Sect when he was 11 years old, but later on, he became aware of the Zen sect and studied Zen teachings under Kennichi KOHO in Kamakura and Jomin NANPO (Daio Kokushi; 1235 - 1308) in Kyoto.
When Jomin NANPO moved to Kencho-ji Temple in Kamakura, Shuho also moved to Kamakura and obtained Inka (Certification of spiritual achievement) from his mentor in 1307 when he was 26 years old.
After Shiho (inheriting the dharma from a priest master), he practiced kotsujiki-gyo (begging for offerings from community members) for about 20 years at a tea hut in Kyoto.
As he practiced a Zen Style with unparallel severity, few people visited him.
With the devotion of Norimura AKAMATSU (Enshin), who shared birthplace with him, Shuho constructed a small temple at Murasakino of Rakuhoku (north of the capital of Kyoto) in 1315 (or 1319).
This is believed to be the origin of Daitoku-ji Temple.
Emperor Hanazono (1297 - 1348) devoted to Shuho and he issued an imperial command to make Daitoku-ji Temple a place of prayer in 1325.
Around that time, he boosted his reputation by confuting priests of both exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism on Shochu no shuron (debate about teachings of Tendai Sect and Shingon Sect).
Egen KANZAN (1277 - 1360) was his disciple.
When Myocho became seriously ill in 1337, he recommended Egen KANZAN as the Zen priest who was to be the mentor of the Cloistered Emperor Hanazono after Myocho died, upon the request of the Cloistered Emperor Hanazono,.
In addition, when the Cloistered Emperor Hanazono converted his detached palace at Hanazono into a Zen temple, Myocho named it Myoshin-ji Temple on Mt. Shobo and he died on January 21 of the same year.
The founding year of Myoshin-ji Temple was 1337 and Egen KANZAN, who received Myocho's last words, was its founder.
Zen Style emphasized to attainment of one's own enlightenment through strict, severe and relentless ascetic practice and it intended to revive the Zen Style prevailed in the period of the Tang Dynasty.
Myocho nurtured his disciples with his own Zen conundrums and made a frontal challenge to the essence of Zen without using hoben (expedients).
The Buddhist lineage from Jomin NANPO (Daio Kokushi), Myocho's mentor, through Myocho SHUHO (Daito Kokushi) to Egen KANZAN is called 'otokan' (literally means Daio, Daito and Kanzen) which all of the current Rinzai Sects in Japan belong to.
Among his writings, "Daito Kokushi goroku" (Analects of Daito Kokushi), "Kana-hogo" (Buddhist sermon in kana (the Japanese syllabary)) and "Shoun Yawa" (Dialogue of Myocho SHUHO and Hikari Osho at Shoun-an Hut) are well known.
Episodes
Myocho SHUHO was fond of oriental melon.
When Emperor Hanazono came to know that Myocho was in the group of beggars, he instructed a government officer to post a notice stating that oriental melons would be given to beggars free of charge on a certain day.
On that day, when an officer told the group of beggars to 'come here without using your feet,' one of the beggars immediately responded with 'give it to me without using your hands' and as a result, the beggar in question was identified as Myocho.
As Myocho stood tall when he first met with Emperor Hanazono, the Emperor said 'A Buddhist priest is strange because you stand tall even when meeting with the emperor,' but Myocho immediately responded 'The emperor is strange because you stand tall even when meeting with a Buddhist priest.'
Ejo KOUN ((1198 - September 26, 1280) was a priest of the Zen Sect in the Kamakura period.
He was the second founder of the Soto Sect and the second chief priest of Eihei-ji Temple (the period of his term; August 1253 - 1267).
He was reappointed and was in office from March in 1272 until September in 1280).
His shigo (posthumous name) was Dokofusho Kokushi.
He was born in Kyoto as a son of Tamemichi KUJO.
He went up to Mt. Hiei when he was a child and became a learned priest pursuing his studies of the Tendai Sect when he was 18 years old.
Although he excelled in scholarship and was a promising priest, he left the temple because of his mother's admonition saying 'You should endeavor to enlighten people as an inconspicuous priest by preaching to them whilst wearing a sedge hat and no sandals, rather than by pursuing high status only through studying.'
When he was 24 years old, he completed the study of teaching of Jodo Sect under the guidance of Shoku, a priest of the Seizan school of the Jodo Sect, but he was not persuaded and when he was 26 years old, he started to study Zen under the guidance of Kakuan, a priest of the Nihon Daruma Sect who resided at Tonomine in Yamato Province.
Ejo obtained Inka (Certification of spiritual achievement) from Kakuan and became his leading disciple, but in 1228 he was forced to evacuate because of a fire set by many priests of Kofuku-ji Temple.
Under such a chaotic situation, he heard about the reputation of Dogen, who stayed at Kennin-ji Temple after returning from Sung (dynasty), and challenged Dogen to a doctrinal debate.
After several days of the doctrinal debate, he finally admitted that Dogen's views were superior to his and asked for Dogen's guidance, although Dogen was younger than him by 2 years.
On this occasion, Dogen declined it because he was staying at a temporary residence.
In 1234, Ejo visited Dogen, who had left Kennin-ji Temple and was staying at his tea hut located at Fukakusa in Yamashiro Province, and asked for his guidance once again and was allowed.
In 1236, when Dogen founded Kosho-ji Temple, Ejo was assumed the position of shuso (the leader of monks practicing asceticism) and became the patriarch of believers.
Since then, he served Dogen at all times and strived to record and spread Dogen's teachings.
Since he put most of Dogen's writings "Shobogenzo" (Treasury of the Eye of True Teaching) in order and transcribed them, all existent "Shobogenzo" are based on Ejo's manuscript copy.
He also wrote "Shobogenzo-zuimonki" which was a compilation of Buddhist sermons that Dogen usually preached to people (according to the commonly-accepted view at present, this book is believed to have been edited and completed by his leading disciples based on Ejo's posthumous manuscript).
This book is deemed first-class material in order to study the philosophy of Dogen as well as the state of things in the Zen Sect at that time.
"Komyozozanmai" (Samadhi of the Treasury of the Radiant Light), another book written by Ejo, is valued as excellent Zen literature and Soseki NATSUME acclaimed it by saying 'the contents of this book were written by a person who knows things. It is real common sense.'
In 1241, dozens of priests who had belonged to Nihon Daruma Sect converted to Dogen's school.
Although it is not clear to what extent Ejo was involved in their conversion, it can easily be surmised that he played a not small role.
After Dogen passed away in 1253, Ejo succeeded his position of the 2nd chief priest of Eihei-ji Temple.
Within Eihei-ji Temple at that time, there was a conflict between conservative priests who stuck to Dogen's old traditions and reformist priests who tried to introduce, for the purpose of educating people, ritual rules that Dogen had insisted unnecessary (most of them belonged to the school of Nihon Daruma Sect) and under such circumstances, Ejo constantly had to strive to mediate and conciliate both groups.
In 1267, he handed over the position of chief priest to Gikai TETTSU, who was his disciple from the period of the Nihon Daruma Sect, but the conflict between two groups became intensified (Sandai Soron (third-generation differentiation)).
Due to such a situation, Gikai resigned and left the temple in March 1272 and Ejo was reappointed.
Even after assuming the position of the chief priest of Eihei-ji Temple, Ejo is said to have kept the attitude of being an attendant of Dogen throughout his life, built his residence next to the mausoleum of Dogen and served Dogen's effigy in the same manner as he had done while Dogen had been alive.
Further, as he was afraid that he might be enshrined in the same category as Dogen as one of the successive chief priests, he left a will saying 'My remains should be buried at the place of Dogen's attendants and on the anniversary of my death, a memorial service and sutra chanting should be conducted while facing the tomb of Dogen.'
He died of illness on September 26, 1280.
As he disliked a special memorial service for himself, he hoped his memorial service would be conducted on a certain day during the 8-day memorial service conducted on the anniversary of Dogen's death and his hope was realized.
At Eihei-ji Temple, keeping the entrance door of Shoyoden (mausoleum of Dogen) slightly open is a custom.
This is because even at present, Ejo is believed to make the rounds of Dogen's mausoleum.
Also, inspection of yakuryo (inspection of the temple premises conducted by a responsible monk) is said to be conducted at times other than midnight in order not to meet Ejo.
Jiun (August 24, 1718 - January 22, 1805) was a Buddhist priest of the Shingon Sect in the late Edo period.
He emphasized Buddhist precepts and advocated 'Shoboritsu' (Shingonritsu (literally, True Word Precepts)).
He was a founder of Unden Shinto.
He was also known as a skilled calligrapher.
His secular surname was the Uezuki clan.
His imina (personal name) was Onko.
His go (pen name) was Hyakufuchi Doji (literally, know-nothing child), Katsuragi Sanjin (literally, a man on Mt. Katsuragi) and Soryu no okina (literally, an old man of twin dragon), and so on.
His title of honor was Jiun Sonja (Buddhist saint).
He was born at Kurayashiki (Warehouse-residence) of Takamatsu clan's located in Osaka Nakanoshima (Osaka Prefecture) (present Kita-ku Ward, Osaka City) as a son of Yasunori KOZUKI, became a priest at Horaku-ji Temple in Settsu Province (Higashi-Sumiyoshi-ku Ward, Osaka City) at his age of 13 in accordance with his father's will and studied Esoteric Buddhism and Sanskrit under the guidance of Sadanori SHINOBITSUNA, the chief priest of the temple.
When he was 18 years old, he went to Kyoto at the order of Shinobitsuna and studied ancient Confucianism under the guidance of Togai ITO.
In the following year, he travelled to Nara to study Exoteric Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism and the Shinto Religion and thereafter he started to study Buddhist precepts at Nonaka-dera Temple (Habikino City) in Kawachi Province under the guidance of Shugen and was bestowed Gusokukai (taking the full precepts) in 1738.
In the following year, he received kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) from Shinobitsuna and assumed the position of the chief priest of Horaku-ji Temple, but he handed over the position to a fellow priest two years later.
Thereafter, he visited Daibai, a priest of Soto Sect in Shinano Province, and studied the Zen Sect as well.
In 1744, he restored Choei-ji Temple (Higashiosaka City) in Kawachi, assumed the position of the chief priest and conducted his first lecture on Buddhist precepts, and thereafter he continued ascetic training and lectures on Mt. Koya and other places in the Kinki region.
From 1758, he stayed at a tea hut called Soryuan on Mt. Ikomayama, concentrated on studying and wrote 1,000 volumes of "Bongakushinryo", a book of Sanskrit research.
In this book, he rejected the magical interpretation of Sanskrit which was prevalent in the world of Esoteric Buddhism and tried to correctly understand the contents of the original Buddhist scriptures written in Sanskrit, by studying Sanskrit grammar.
The contents of "Bongakushinryo" were highly valued by Silvain Revie, a French researcher of Sanskrit who came to Japan during the Meiji period.
He wrote "Juzen Hogo" (Sermons on the Ten Good Precepts) in 1775.
In 1776, he joined Koki-ji Temple (Anan-cho, Minamikawachi-gun) in Kawachi.
With the support of Yasumitsu YANAGISAWA, a feudal lord of the Koriyama clan, he repaired the temple buildings of Koki-ji Temple and selected this temple as the head temple of Shoboritsu.
It is said that as Yasumitsu was a devout believer in Jiun, he buried his hair beside Jiun's tomb when he took the tonsure after the death of Jiun.
In his last years, he advocated his own Shinto thoughts and decided on Iwafune-jinja Shrine (Kanan-cho) as the konpondojo (fundamental training hall).
The Shinto religion which Jiun advocated was called 'Unden Shinto' in later years.
In 1804, he ended his life at Amida-ji temple in Kyoto.
Gyokyo (years of his birth and death was unknown) was a Buddhist priest of Daian-ji Temple in the Heian period.
His father was KI no Gyohitsu of Yamashiro no kami (the governor of Yamashiro Province).
He was a secular brother of Yakushin, a priest of Ninna-ji Temple, and an uncle of Yasumune, the betto (a priest who manages the affairs of a temple) of Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine.
His life before entering the priesthood was unknown.
He is said to have studied Hosso Sect, Sanron Sect and Esoteric Buddhism at Daian-ji Temple, but he is also said to have studied under the guidance of Gyoho, the mentor of Saicho who was the founder of the Nihon-Tendai Sect, and Soei of the Shingon Sect.
Upon the recommendation of Shinga, he was dispatched to Usa-Hachimangu Shrine in Kyushu in 858 in order to pray for the enthronement of Imperial Prince Korehito (later Emperor Seiwa), a grandchild from a daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa, who married into another family.
In 859, the following year, he once again confined himself for 90 days in Usa-Hachimangu Shrine to pray for the protection of the Emperor since Imperial Prince Korehito was enthroned soon after.
Since he received the oracle during this period, he prayed for the coming of Great Bodhisattva Hachiman from Usa-Hachimangu Shrine to Gokoku-ji Temple at Mt. Otoko in Kyoto Prefecture, and founded Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine.
He assumed the position of dento daihosshi (great Dharma-master who transmits the flame) in 863.
Kakuyu (1053 - November 3, 1140) was a Buddhist priest of the Tendai Sect in the late Heian period.
He was well known by people as Toba Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) and although he was a high-ranking priest who played important roles in Japanese Buddhist society, he was also well versed in paintings and is assumed to be the painter of Choju-Jinbutsu-giga (scrolls of frolicking animals and humans).
Thanks to his humorous style, he was sometimes mentioned as the originator of cartoons.
Kakuyu was born in 1053 as the 9th son of MINAMOTO no Takakuni.
He became a priest in his youth and while studying Tendai Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism at Onjo-ji Temple, he also came to excel in painting.
He resided at Horinin of Onjo-ji Temple for a long time and made a great contribution in collecting Esoteric Buddhist art as well as nurturing artists while striving to develop his own painting technique.
While successively holding important positions at big temples and shrines, such as betto (a monk who manages the affairs of a temple) of Shitenno-ji Temple, betto of Hosei-ji Temple and chori (the head priest) of Onjo-ji Temple, he became Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) in 1132 and Daisojo (the highest ranking Buddhist priest) in 1134.
He assumed the position of the forty-seventh head priest of the temple in 1138, resigned 3 days later, moved to Shokongoin of Toba-Rikyu Palace, where Emperor Toba, a devout believer in Kakuyu, resided, and assumed the position of gojiso (a priest who prays to guard the emperor) in the Toba-Rikyu Palace.
Thereafter, he was called Toba Sojo.
Kakuyu died on November 3, 1140 at the advanced age of almost 90.
When he was requested by his disciples to leave a will concerning the division of his property, he is said to have left a will saying 'Division of property should be decided according to physical strength.'
His paintings are called caricature since they are full of humor and satire.
As the anecdote of his last will indicates, he seemed to have been a person of humorous personality and he is depicted as a person with a mischievous and innocent personality in "Uji Shui Monogatari" (a collection of the Tales from Uji).
At the same time, Kakuyu is believed to have been critical of Buddhist society, as well as the politics of the time, in spite of the fact that he successively held important posts in Buddhist society.
According to legend, the national treasures "Choju-Jinbutsu-giga" (Choju-Giga), "Hohi Kassen" (Battle of breaking wind) and "Yobutsu Kurabe" (Measuring phallus) are believed to be his work.
Although at a glance these works appear to be simple, cheerful and humorous paintings, they are rich with satire spirit and are assumed to be Toba Sojo's works.
From the viewpoint of art history, however, there is no established evidence that proves the fact that Kakuyu was the painter of these paintings.
On the other hand, these paintings are said to represent Kakuyu's painting style well and there are opinions asserting that a part of Choju-Jinbutsu-giga must have been painted by Kakuyu.
Nihon Daruma Sect is a school of the Zen Sect which Nonin DAINICHIBO founded.
Nonin initially studied at Tendai Sect but he attained enlightenment by himself, without a mentor, by reading through Zen books that had been introduced into Japan in the old days and thereafter, he began propagation activities at Sanpo-ji Temple in Settsu Province (Osaka Prefecture).
The name of Daruma Sect derives from the legend, which appears in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and "Genko shakusho (History of Buddhism of the Genko era), that Prince Shotoku met with the incarnation of Daruma Daishi.
Although the name of Nihon Daruma Sect is commonly used at present, this sect was simply called Daruma Sect while Nonin was alive because the current name, which includes the word of 'Nihon' (Japan), was put into use by researchers in early modern times.
Zen with no mentor advocated by Nonin was seen as unorthodox in Zen Sect society whose tradition was the succession of teaching from a mentor to a disciple.
In addition, as the court noble society was accustomed to teachings that eyed achieving earthly desires, such as Esoteric Buddhism, there was no background to accept Nonin's Zen teaching which aims to attain enlightenment through ascetic training and his propagation activities constantly faced difficulty.
As for the reputation of Nonin's Zen teaching at the time, it can easily be guessed from the fact that conservative people in waka (a 31-syllable Japanese poem) society criticized FUJIWARA no Teika, who created new style waka around the same time, by saying 'Shingihikyo no darumauta' (heresy of Daruma).
Such ridicules or attacks disappeared after Totsuko SETTAN of Mt. Ikuo bestowed Inka (Certification of spiritual achievement) on Nonin and from then, his reputation started to rise.
Nonin, who felt the time was ripe, started propagation activities in Kyoto together with Eisai, but such activities were banned due to an appeal to the Emperor made by priests of Mt. Hiei and soon after, Nonin was killed in an accident.
After Nonin's death, Kakuan HIGASHIYAMA, Nonin's disciple, succeeded in the religious order and continued propagation activities, together with Ejo KOUN (1198 - 1280), at Mt. Tonomine in Yamato Province (Nara Prefecture).
However, they were again attacked by believers of Nara Kofuku-ji Temple by means of fire and fled to Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture) (in 1227).
In Echizen, they used Namitsuki-dera Temple, one of the principal temples of Tendai Sect, the lineage of Mt. Haku, as the base of activities.
After Kakuan's death, Ejo in 1234 and Ekan, Giin (1217 - 1300), Gikai (1219 - 1309) and Gien, in 1241, also became disciples of Dogen who stayed at Kosho-ji Temple in Fukakusa (Kyoto Prefecture).
Although it was believed in the past that the activities of Daruma Sect finally ended at that time, it has become known in recent years that one of its schools had survived at Sanpo-ji Temple until the end of the medieval period.
It is further believed that Kakun's school was a branch and the school of Sanpo-ji Temple was mainstream.

Summary
Kenpon Hokke Sect is a school of the Nichiren Sect whose head temple is Myoman-ji Temple in Kyoto.
In the past, it was also called the Myoman-ji School of the Nichiren Sect or Nichijumon School.
Honda Nissho Shonin
He was born in 1867 as the 2nd son of Kenjiro KUNITOMO of the Himeji clan and became the heir of Nikkyo HONDA, who was a priest at his family temple.
He studied at Tetsugakukan (later Toyo University).
He assumed the position of the head of the religious affairs division at the age of 24 and strived for education and propagation since he was so disappointed with the school's deep-rooted evil and slump, but his activities caused other priests' resentment against him and he was suddenly divested of his priesthood.
In order to realize justice, he established propagation facilities of the Kenpon Hokke Sect at many places and was constantly on the move.
On the back of many religious associations' voice that requested his return to Buddhist society, he returned to the priesthood and compiled the elements of the Myoman-ji School.
He renamed the school Kenpon Hokke Sect.
As he was worried about the decadence in Buddhist society, as well as the fragmented Nichiren Sect, he organized toitsudan (unification groups) in cooperation with interested people from other religious orders.
Thereafter, he organized Tensei-kai, which consisted of prominent persons from various societies, Komyo-kai, Chimei-kai, which were for females, and Jikei-kai, which was for laborers.
He was active throughout the nation, spreading Buddhism centered on Buddha and Shakyamuni, which was advocated by Nichiren Shonin, as well as the joy of belief that gives courage and mercy in life.
He died in 1931 at the age of 65.
History
Nichiju established Myoman-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) in 1389.
In 1608, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA ordered Nikkei of Myoman-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) and Kakuzan of Jodo Sect to hold a doctrinal debate (Keicho shuron) at Edo-jo Castle and Nikkei was punished by having his ears and nose cut off.
In 1872, the Nichijumon School became associated with other schools in the Nichiren Sect according to the system of one superintendent priest for one sect.
In 1874, the Nichijumon School became affiliated with the Shoretsu School of the Nichiren Sect.
In 1876, Nichijumon School officially named itself Myoman-ji School while nominating its own superintendent priest and the Shoretsu School of the Nichiren Sect was dissolved.
In 1898, Myoman-ji School officially renamed itself Kenpon Hokke Sect.
In 1941, Kenpon Hokke Sect, Honmon Sect and Nichiren Sect consolidated in accordance with the Religious Corporation Act and the new sect officially named itself Nichiren Sect.
In 1947, out of about 380 temples belonging to the Nichijumon School, about 200 temples including Myoman-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) became independent from the Nichiren Sect again and officially named themselves Kenpon Hokke Sect.
Another 180 temples of the Nichijumon School remained in the Nichiren Sect.
Head temples and Kazusa ten temples belong to each sect as shown below.
Kenpon Hokke Sect : The main temple Myoman-ji Temple, the head temple Aizu Myoho-ji Temple, the head temple Shinagawa Tenmyokoku-ji Temple, the head temple Kyoto Jakko-ji Temple, Kazusa ten temples including Toke Zensho-ji Temple, Toke Honju-ji Temple, Honno Renpuku-ji Temple, Togane Honzen-ji Temple, Kitanokoya Myotoku-ji Temple and Matsunogo Honsho-ji Temple.
Nichiren Sect : The main temple Aizu Tenmyokoku-ji Temple, the main temple Iida Honko-ji Temple, the main temple Mitsuke Genmyo-ji Temple, the main temple Yoshimi Myoritsu-ji Temple, Kazusa ten temples including Oami Rensho-ji Temple and Miyatanidanrin Honkoku-ji Temple.
Independent : The head temple Shinagawa Honko-ji Temple, Kazusa ten temples including Togane Saifuku-ji Temple and Tanaka Hoko-ji Temple.
Currently, Nichigen NAKAMURA is the three hundred and fifth chief abbot of Myoman-ji Temple.
Mongaku (1139 - September 5, 1203) was a priest of the Shingon Sect of Buddhism who lived from the Heian period to the early Kamakura period.
He had several disciples, including Jokaku and Myokei.
His secular name was Morito ENDO.
Being originally a samurai belonging to the Watanabe party in Settsu Province, which was under the umbrella of Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), he served Imperial Princess Muneko (Josaimonin), a daughter of Emperor Toba, as a Hokumen samurai (samurai on guard at the ex-emperor's palace).
He is said to have loved Kesa Gozen, the wife of Wataru WATANABE, who was his male cousin and worked together with him, killed her by mistake, and consequently become a priest.
(Based on this incident, the nagauta (ballad sung to samisen accompaniment, sometimes with other instruments) "Toba no Koizuka" (tomb of the lover in Toba) was created in the Meiji period.)
Wishing to revive Jingo-ji Temple, where priests were absolutely corrupt, Mongaku presented a direct petition to Emperor Goshirakawa, which resulted in Mongaku being exiled to Izu Province, which was the feudal domain of MINAMOTO no Yorimasa of Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), the head of the Watanabe party.
Mongaku persuaded MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, who was also exiled to Izu Province, to take up arms against the Taira family.
Thereafter, he restored temples in various places under the patronage of Yoritomo and the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa.
After Yoritomo's death, however, Mongaku got on the wrong side of Emperor Gotoba, and was then exiled to Sado Province and died there.
"Jigokumon" (Gates of Hell), a film directed by Teinosuke KINUGASA that won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, depicts a drama where Morito ENDO (whose role was played by Kazuo HASEGAWA) loved Kesa Gozen (whose role was played by Machiko KYO), the wife of Wataru WATANABE (whose role was played by Isao YAMAGATA), and consequently became a priest.
"Hinotori (the Phoenix): Turbulent Times" (cartoon) by Osamu TEZUKA depicts Morito ENDO and Mongaku as different persons.

Summary
With succeeding Nikko's dharma, this school divides the basis of Hoke-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra) into Hon-Jaku (Honmon and Shakumon, a theory of the Fundamental Aspect (Honmon) and the Manifestation Doctrine (Shakumon) of the Lotus Sutra in Nichiren Buddhism) and decides mastery for each.
Although it was once forced to adopt the philosophy of Icchi School and Zobutsu School by Kansei no honan (the religious persecution in Kansei era), it is, at present, a school of Fujimon School whose principal image of Buddha is mandala.
History
In 1339, Nisson established Jogyoin Temple (Kyoto Prefecture).
In 1550, Nisshin merged Jogyoin Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) with Juhon-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) and renamed it Yoho-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture).
In 1872, Nissonmon School was associated with other schools that inherit Nichiren's Teaching in accordance with the system of one superintendent priest for one sect.
In 1874, Nissonmon School became affiliated with the Shoretsu School of Nichiren Sect, which was an integrated religious order of the Shoretsu School.
In 1876, as the Shoretsu School of Nichiren Sect was dissolved into each school, Nissonmon School organized an integrated religious order together with other head temples and their branch temples of Fujimon School, nominated its own superintendent priest and officially named itself the Komon School of Nichiren Sect (Komon School).
In 1899, Komon School was renamed Honmon Sect.
In 1941, Honmon Sect merged with the Shoretsu School of Kenpon Hokke Sect and Icchi School of Nichiren Sect in accordance with the Religious Corporation Act and officially named themselves Nichiren Sect.
In 1950 when Nichijo ADACHI was the chief abbot, Yoho-ji temple and 50 of its branch temples became independent from Nichiren Sect (some of the branch temples remained in Nichiren Sect and became members of Shimane Sonmonkai (島根尊門会) of Koto Hoenkai (興統法縁会) and since then, they have been officially calling themselves Nichiren Hon Sect up to the present time.
The term earthen image means images of which the material is clay.
Unlike terra cotta, a firing process is not involved in producing them.
Earthen images were introduced from Tang into Japan in the early Nara period and many images were produced in the late Nara period.
The producing process employed winding straw ropes around wooden mandrel, heaping up coarse-grained barren soil followed by fine-particle finishing soil and molding by a pallet or the fingers.
The seated statue of Miroku Buddha, which is the principal image of Buddha at Kondo (main hall) of Taima-dera Temple in Nara, was produced in the late 7th century and is believed to be the oldest earthen image in Japan.
Most of the earthen images were produced in the Nara period and few were produced in Heian period or later (mainly after 9th century) when wood carvings became the mainstream in sculpture society.
Well-known products, especially those designated as national treasures, are as follows.
The seated statue of Miroku Buddha (Maitreya) at Kondo of Taima-dera Temple (Nara Prefecture)
The seated statue of Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion) enshrined at Ryugai-ji Temple (Nara Prefecture) - its height is 4.6 m and it is the tallest earthen image in Japan

Buddhist altar fittings are defined as special tools or accessories which are used by clergymen, such as Buddhist monks, on the occasion of Buddhist rituals and they are different from daily necessities.
They are also called ritual implements or ritual apparatus.
According to Buddhist precepts, monks were originally prohibited to own money and other articles other than sanne-ippatsu (three robes and one begging bowl), which were deemed as the minimum required clothes and eating utensil.
After 100 years had passed after the death of Shaka, however, monks were divided into two groups (fundamental schism), a group which requested permitting the ownership of minimum money and daily necessities that were donated by believers, and a conservative group which stuck to Buddhist precepts, and monks belonging to the former group were allowed to own money and other articles other than sanne-ippatsu.
With Buddhism introduced into the western regions of China as well as China after A.D, Buddhist monks began presiding over rituals such as prayers and funerals among people and tools which were used in such rituals were developed.
With Esoteric Buddhism, which had been prevalent in India, introduced into China and Tibet in the 7th century, special Buddhist altar fittings such as Vajra and mandala came into use.
Further, as Jodo-kyo (Pure Land teachings), which had originated in China, helped the explosive diffusion of Buddhism among ordinary people, and ordinary lay believers began worshipping Buddha directly by themselves rather than through Buddhist monks and as a result, Buddhist altar fittings such as Juzu (beads) and Buddhist pictures were brought into use by lay believers at their home.
Currently, there exist several centers for the production of family Buddhist altars and Buddhist altar fittings, including Kyo-butsugu (Buddhist altar fittings produced in Kyoto) which are designated as national traditional industrial arts.

Setsuna is one of the Buddhist concepts of time and is the briefest unit of time in Buddhism.
It is also known as nen.
There are various theories as to the length of setsuna, however it is said that there are 65 setsuna in the space of one click of the fingers, and also in the "Mahavibhasa-sastra" (a Buddhist document) it states that 24 hours = 30 mukoritta (1 mukoritta is 2880 seconds) = 900 robaku (1 robaku is 96 seconds) = 54,000 tasetsuna (1 tasetsuna is 1.6 seconds) = 6,480,000 setsuna and the length of one setsuna is 1/75th of a second.
However, Nagarjuna (an Indian philosopher), originator of Yuishiki doctrine, rejects the concept of determining a specific length of time for setsuna.
According to the Sarvastivadin school which is a sect of Theravada Buddhism, human consciousness is the mind repeatedly emerging and ceasing in the period of one setsuna.
In response to this, Dogen, a priest in the Soto sect, preached in "Shobogenzo" and 'Hotsubodaishin' (Awakening the Mind of Enlightenment) works that the meaning of seeking enlightenment practicing meditation puts such impermanence first, and because it is always changing, the bad is extinguished and good is born.
Setsuna is used as a numerical unit in countries that use the Chinese writing system.
The value of Setsuna differs across the ages and regions, however nowadays it is 10-18(0.000000000000000001), or one-tenth of a dantsu or ten times a rittoku.
In Japanese, the word 'setsunai' which means painful or distressing has no relationship to Setsuna, and is derived from the Chinese character for setsu which means to feel strongly, as can be seen in the way it is written with different characters than Setsuna..
Jiin Sho-Hatto is a general term for a set of regulations that applied to the Buddhist religious community in the Tokugawa Shogunate in the Edo period.
However, as there is no fixed proper name, several names such as 'Shoshu Jiin Hatto' (Acts Relating to the Temples of Each Sect) and 'Shoshu Sho-honzan Hatto' (Acts Relating to the Head Temple of Each Sect) have also been used formally.
While the Edo bakufu (the Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) adopted a policy to respect Confucianism, particularly Neo-Confucianism, it promulgated the Jiin Sho-Hatto for Buddhist priests belonging to each sect with the aim of controlling those priests, as well as approving the ownership of temple estates and promoting the maintenance of Buddhist temples.
In relation to the Zen sect, following acts were each promulgated one by one.
Sotoshu Hatto (Act for the Soto sect), 1612
Chokkyo shie no Hatto (Act prohibiting the Imperial Court from granting purple Buddhist robes to high-rank priests), 1613
Gozan-Jissatsu Shozan Hatto (Act for the five first-class temples, ten second-class temples and many third-class temples), 1615
Myoshinji Hatto (Act for Myoshin-ji Temple), 1615
Eiheiji Hatto (Act for Eihei-ji Temple), 1615
Daitokuji Hatto (Act for Daitoku-ji Temple), 1615
Sojiji Hatto (Act for Soji-ji Temple), 1615
With the promulgation of Gozan-Jissatsu Shozan Hatto, the traditional posts of 'Rokuon Soroku' (the highest-ranking priest responsible for taking charge of managing personal affairs, ranking temples and other duties) and 'Inryoshiki' (officer of correspondence between Shogun and Soroku) were abolished, and instead a new post of 'Konchiin Soroku' (Soroku of Konchi-in sub temple of Nanzen-ji Temple) was established by appointing Suden of Kokui no saisho (a priest who has influence in politics) to the post in 1619.
Initially, the Edo bakufu tried to control the entire Zen sect through this new Soroku, although the leadership had a direct effect only on the Gozan-ha (group of five first-class temples in Zen sect).
After the death of Suden, the jisha-bugyo (magistrate of temples and shrines), which was established in 1635, took charge of the management of temples, with the result that the authority of the Soroku was further reduced.
Basically, the Soroku position evolved into that of Furegashira (post dealing with orders and negotiation arising from the jisha-bugyo) of the Gozan-ha.
With the enactment of Jiin Sho-Hatto to control the priests, the Edo bakufu also established 'Terauke seido' (the system of organizing whole temples in Japan with the registration of follower families) and 'Honmatsu seido' (the system of head and branch temples) aiming to firmly control Buddhism.
Wakei Seijaku (literally meaning harmony, respect, purity and tranquility) is a slogan emphasized in Sado (Japanese tea ceremony), which is particularly respected in the House of Sen through the 'Shiki' (Four Principles of Tea) as laid down by SEN no Rikyu.
This slogan, however, is not academically accepted as being directly attributable to Rikyu, because there is no description about it in any credible material compiled in the period contemporaneous with Rikyu.
The recent study by Chuzo MACHIDA, 'The Background of the Establishment of the Nanpo-roku (the Secret Book of Rikyu) and the Birth of the Rikyu Myth' (reported in "No.9 of Chanoyu Bunka-Gaku (The Study of the Culture of Tea Ceremony), 2004), pursues the possibility that the term 'Wakei Seijaku' should be attributed to Daishin Gito (1657 - 1730), the 273rd chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple.
Note: The four-Chinese character idiom Wakei Seijaku (和敬清寂) is often mistakenly written as 和敬静寂.
Genkitsu SANYO (1548 - June 19, 1612) was a Zen priest who was active during the period from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the early Edo period.
He was originally from Hizen Province (Saga Prefecture).
His Go (pen name) was Kanshitsu.
He was called Kicchoro or Kanshitsu Osho.
He went up to the capital in his childhood and became a priest at Iwakura Entsu-ji Temple (Kyoto City).
After assuming the position of the head of Ashikaga School, he attended Ieyasu TOKUGAWA during the Battle of Sekigahara and at its front, he distinguished himself by conducting divination (using bamboo divination sticks).
He assumed the position of Jisha-bugyo (a commissioner of temples and shrines) along with Konchiin Suden and thereafter, he succeeded Jotai SAISHO as a responsible officer of Shuinjo (shogunate license to trade) related jobs and was involved in shuinsen (shogunate-licensed trading ship) related jobs.
Later, he was invited by Ieyasu to a school in Fushimi-ku Ward, founded Enko-ji Temple and strived for the publication of the Fushimi edition.
Dohaku MANZAN (1635 - 1715) was a priest of Soto Sect in the early Edo period.
He was originally from Bingo Province (present Hiroshima Prefecture).
His secular surname was Fujii.
His Go (pen name) was Dojin FUKKO.
At the age of 10, he entered the Buddhist priesthood under the guidance of Dohan ISSEN of Ryuko-ji Temple.
When Dohan resigned from the post at Ryuko-ji Temple, Dohaku accompanied him and went to the east region of Japan.
He practiced Zen meditation under Bunshun KOSHU and Soko GESSHU.
He succeeded the teachings of Soko GESSHU.
As the successor of Soko, he assumed the position of the chief priest of Daijo-ji Temple in Kaga Province (present Ishikawa Prefecture).
Along with his mentor priest Soko and Zuiho MENZAN, he advocated the restoration of the sect's tradition and strived for the rehabilitation of shiho (succession of the lineage of sect) and kiku (regulations) in the sect.
In the Soto Sect at that time, other than Hoto (the lineage of sect) that was inherited from a mentor priest to a disciple by means of menju (face to face transmission) (nin-po), there was also another Hoto that was inherited by means of succeeding the position of chief priest of a temple (garan-ho), and under such circumstances, there were a variety of abuses resulting from such confusion.
Under such circumstances, Dohaku and others asserted that only menju shiho of isshi-insho (a rule whereby a priest who received menju from his mentor priest shall not change his mentor priest during his whole life) (nin-po), which the founder Dogen valued, should be regarded as legitimate.
The campaign by Dohaku and others affected Jisha-bugyo (a commissioner of temples and shrines) and their objectives were accomplished when Eihei-ji Temple law and Soji-ji Temple law were enacted.
He also rearranged and revamped the sect's kiku, which had been corrupted, following Ryuki INGEN's 'Obaku Shingi' (Chinese Characters as Symbols in the Huanboquingui).
Daijo-ji Temple, of which the chief priest was Dohaku, became known as the temple of rigid kiku and was called 'Kikudaijo.'
In 1689, Kozen, the chief priest of Eihei-ji Temple, asked Dohaku and others to become advisors for restoring soki (the rules of the temple) and the reform initiated by Dohaku gradually took root in the sect.
On the other hand, Tenkei Denson and others criticized Dohaku, who tried to apply seiki (regulations) of the other sect (Obaku Sect) instead of traditional regulations established by Dogen, as 'formalism' and there were debates among them.
These debates, however, activated the study of sect teachings and the revision and publication of sect code, and produced many achievements in Soto Sect.
Dohaku himself was engaged in compiling "Shohogenzo" (Treasury of the Eye of True Teaching) at Daijo-ji Temple and his work Manzanbon (89 volumes) still exists.
After handing over Daijo-ji Temple to Shushin MYOSHU, he lived in seclusion at Kozen-ji Temple in Settsu Province (present Osaka Prefecture).
In 1694, he was asked to restore Genkoan Temple, an ancient temple of Rinzai Sect located in Yamashiro Province, and converted it to a temple of Soto Sect.
Emperor Reigen, who came to know the reputation of Dohaku, invited him for monbo (hearing of Buddhism teachings) but he declined with the excuse of illness.
The Cloistered Emperor, who felt regret, bestowed cotton which he possessed.
In 1715, Dohaku died of illness at the age of 80.
Myoe (February 28, 1173 - February 18, 1232) was a Buddhist monk of Kegon Sect in the early Kamakura period.
His hoi (imina (personal name) used by Buddhist priests) was Koben.
He was also called Myoe Shonin or Toganoo Shonin.
TAIRA no Shigekuni.
His mother was a daughter of Muneshige YUASA.
He was born in the present Aritagawa-cho, Wakayama Prefecture.
He lost his parents when he was 4 years old and became the priest of Jingo-ji Temple on Mt. Takao with Jokaku, a disciple of Bunkaku, being his mentor.
He studied Shingon Esoteric Buddhism and Kegon Sect at Ninna-ji Temple and Toda-ji Temple and showed great promise as a priest, but he abandoned the connection with secular society and lived in seclusion at Shirakami, Arita-gun in Kii Province and Ikadachi in the same Province.
As he yearned for Shakyamuni very much, he twice planned to travel to India but finally gave up because of the oracle of Kasuga Myojin (the deity of Kasuga Shrine).
In 1206, he founded Kozan-ji Temple when Toganoo of Yamashiro Province was given to him by the retired Emperor Gotoba and strove for kangyo (practice of observation and contemplation) and study.
He highly valued Buddhist precepts and endeavored for the restoration of kenmitsu (exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism) against the increase of nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) supporters.
He left many writings including "Zaijarin" (A Wheel for Pulverizing Heresy) and "Shizakoshiki" (a chant composed of four formulas), both of which criticized Honen's Jodo Sect, "Yumeki," which recorded dreams which he had during his 40 years' kangyo, and "Kyakuhaiboki," which was taken in notes by his disciples.
He also excelled in waka (a 31-syllable Japanese poem) and "Myoe Shonin Waka-shu" is a collection of his waka.
Jogyo (also known as Teigyo, March 25, 1186 - April 3, 1231) was a monk living from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the Kamakura period.
He was the third son (out of wedlock) of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.
His mother was Daishin no Tsubone, a daughter of the Hitachi-nyudo monk Nensai (also called by the names FUJIWARA no Tokinaga and Tomomune DATE), the founder of the Date family.
He was himself also known as Kamakura Hoin (the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests).
Biography
His mother, Daishin no Tsubone, was a lady's maid serving the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), who was favored by Yoritomo and became pregnant.
As Masako HOJO, the lawful wife of Yoritomo, noticed her pregnancy, Daishin no Tsubone was kept at a distance by Yoritomo who feared Masako's anger, and she bore a baby boy at the residence of Kageto NAGATO, one of his retainers.
The child's birth ceremony was not performed for fear of arousing Masako's envy, and Kageto retired to the vicinity of Fukazawa after running away with his children, because he had been cut off by Masako after she discovered that he had harbored Daishin no Tsubone.
He was in such a pitiful condition as no one would agree to become his wet nurse for fear of Masako, therefore his mother raised him away from the public eye.
He went to Kyoto to become a priest at the age of seven on July 7, 1192.
Yoritomo secretly visited his son on the evening he was due to depart in order to pass him a sword.
He changed his Homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) from 'Nokan,' which he used soon after he became a priest at Ninna-ji Temple, to Jogyo (also referred as Teigyo) after practicing asceticism further, keeping himself away from the world of everyday affairs by climbing Mt. Koya to confine himself for religious training.
While the members of the Minamoto clan were killed one after another amid a struggle for supremacy, he devoted himself to religious practice completely isolated from the general world, and as a result he earned respect from many people.
Later, Masako finally became one of Jogyo's believers, and asked him to pray to Buddha for the happiness of the dead in the Minamoto clan, providing him with aid and money.
Accordingly, establishing an Amida-do Hall (temple hall having an enshrined image of Amitabha) called Joroku-do in Kyochi-bo, Mt. Koya, Jogyo put the hair of his departed father Yoritomo into the sitting statue of Amitabha which was enshrined in the hall for the repose of his soul, and furthermore, he held a religious service for the repose of the soul of the third Shogun MINAMOTO no Sanetomo, a half younger brother with the same father, by erecting a gorinto (gravestone composed of five pieces set one upon another).
According to one story, when Masako approached him about his ambition to become the fourth shogun, suspecting him of having evil intentions regarding the succession after the death of Sanetomo, he proved his innocence by taking out one of his eyeballs and thoroughly rejecting her offer.
It is said that Masako, who shed tears at the display of honesty, never suspected him again.
He died on Mt. Koya at the age of 46 in 1231, one theory suggesting that he killed himself.
His death resulted in the extinction of the male line of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo (with the death of Take no Gosho three years later, the female line was also extinguished).
Although Jogyo and Nokan are treated as different people in "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (Bloodlines of Noble and Base), this is mistaken.
Senkei IKENOBO (the dates of his birth and death were unknown) was a Buddhist priest of Kyoto Choho-ji Temple (Rokkakudo) in the middle of the Muromachi period.
He became famous during the period from 1469 until 1487 as a superior of Tatebana (standing flowers) and according to 'Hyakuhei Kanojo' (records of flower arrangement by a hundred people) (completed in 1600) compiled by Shocho GEKKEI, a Buddhist monk of Kyoto Tofuku-ji Temple, he is deemed as the founder of Ikenobo School.
According to 'Hekizan Nichiroku' (a diary of the monk Daikyoku, 15th century) (1459 - 1464, 1465 - 1468) written by Zen priest Daikyoku, Senkei in 1462 arranged tens of flowers in a golden vase responding to the invitation of the Sasaki clan, shugo (constable) of Omi Province, and many of the dilettantes inside the capital competed to see it.
Juko MURATA (1432 - June 29, 1502) was a chajin (master of the tea ceremony) in the middle of the Muromachi period.
He was widely believed to be the founder of 'Wabicha' (the tea of refined simplicity).
As he was a Buddhist monk, he should be called, in principle, without a surname.
In practice, however, he has been called 'Juko MURATA.'
Biography
His career is not clear but according to historical records compiled in later years, his father was Mokuichi MURATA Kengyo and his childhood name was Mokichi.
He became a Buddhist monk at Shomyo-ji Temple (Nara City), the temple of Jodo Sect.
Based on postwar research, it was once believed that he had returned to secular life and become a merchant, but currently it is generally believed that he had been a Buddhist monk throughout his life because of the discovery of "Yamashinake raiki" (diary of Hisamori OSAWA, zassho (a person in charge of miscellaneous tasks) of the Yamashina family), which was written in the year when Juko was 64 years old, in which he was referred to as 'Jukobo' (monk Juko).
In addition, it has also been believed that he practiced Zen meditation when he was around 30 years old under the guidance of Sojun IKKYU, a monk of Daitoku-ji School of the Rinzai Sect, but some researchers are skeptical since no firm historical records that support such a view exist.
However, the fact that he had a close relationship with Daitoku-ji Temple is certain, because according to the article on May 15 of second year of Bunki era in the death register of Shinjuan Temple founded by IKKYU, 'Jukoan-shu' offered 1 kan-mon (10,000 yen) for the memorial service on the thirteenth death anniversary of IKKYU (source : "History of Chanoyu," Isao KUMAKURA, Asahi sensho paperback).
Further, even if Juko had practiced Zen meditation under IKKYU, it could be for the purpose of ascetic practices in various sects and teachings and it is impossible to conclude that he converted to Rinzai Sect (it is true, however, that his son Soju was a Buddhist monk of Rinzai Sect).
Based on 'Juko Isshi Mokuroku' (Juko's diary about the method of judgment) in "Yamanoue Soji ki" (The Record of Soji YAMANOUE) (Nigatsu-bon), it had also been believed that Juko served Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, 8th shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), as an instructor of the tea ceremony, but the results of current research on the history of the tea ceremony basically disputes this fact because the descriptions concerning Noami that are included in the same book are not correct in light of the year of his birth and death.
Juko's Tea Ceremony
There are few historical records as explained, but his letter written on a scroll titled 'Furuichi harima hoshi Juko' (its byname is 'Kokoro no Shi no Bun' (literally, a writing of master on my mind)), which was given to his disciple Choin FURUICHI, is highly valued as a precious documentary record of that time.
The expression of 'hiekaruru' (literally, be cold and dry) that appears in the above document is the wording used in Renga (poetic dialogue) and this fact suggests that Juko's tea ceremony was substantially influenced by Renga.
As Juko was acquainted with other artists, his remark saying 'I love the moonlight peeping through the cloud. It is interesting' was introduced in "Zenpo Zodan" (Miscellaneous conversations with Zenpo), a book written by Noh player Zenpo KONPARU, as a famous anecdote concerning Juko.
As the above anecdote shows, his attitude of refusing perfectness itself was the starting point of new tea drinking culture that led to 'Wabicha.'
In the shogun family of the Muromachi period, the Tenmoku tea bowl or celadon porcelain tea bowl of Ryusengama were appreciated because of the tea drinking culture that valued Tang-style tea bowls, but Juko praised plain "Juko bowls" and established the tea ceremony using such plain tea utensils.
Juko's tea ceremony was developed by his disciples, including his son Soju, and he was acclaimed in later years by SEN no Rikyu as the founder of the tea ceremony.
Tea Utensils Which Juko Loved
There are many tea utensils which are believed to be those that Juko loved and they are collectively called 'Juko specialties.'
Principal items are as follows.
Juko tea bowl
Nagezukin tea caddy
Juko bunrin tea container
Juko censer
Kango bokuseki (圜悟墨蹟)
"Painting of egret" by Joki
The fact that Juko owned these utensils was the grounds for the assertion that he once returned to secular life (this is the reason why he has been generally known with by the name 'Juko Murata').
However, according to "Seigan Meibutsu-ki," a record of specialties which was compiled during the Tenmon era and discovered recently, only the Juko tea bowl is listed as a utensil that was owned by Juko.
According to "Yamanoue Soji ki" in 1588, many utensils are listed as the ones that were owned by Juko and the necessity to probe possible fabrication of an oral tradition arose.
The above fact enhanced the credibility of the view that Juko had been a Buddhist monk throughout his life, which was based on the above-mentioned "Yamashina-ke raiki."
Further, the credibility of the view asserting that Juko owned Tang-style specialties languished thanks to the above view, and it has become necessary to rethink the meaning of his description, which appears in 'Kokoro no shi no fumi,' saying 'make the border between Japanese-Chinese admixed.'
Incidentally, there also exists the view asserting that Juko made Goro HANEDA produce natsume (tea utensil), but this view is also questionable because according to chakai-ki (the record of the tea ceremony), natsume was first used from 1558 to 1569, after the death of Joo TAKENO, and its first use was later than other wooden tea utensils.
Sotan (1413 - 1481) was an artist-monk in the middle of the Muromachi period.
His name was also written 宗丹 (Sotan).
His secular surname was Oguri.
He studied India-ink painting with Shubun, an artist-monk of Shokoku-ji Temple.
In 1462, he won the recognition of the 8th shogun, Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, after painting the fusuma-e (images drawn or painted on fusuma) of Shosen-ken in Kyoto Shokoku-ji Temple and in the following year, in 1463, he became the official painter of the shogun family as the successor of Shubun.
Thereafter, he painted the fusuma-e of Takakura Gosho, Untaku-ken and Ishiyama-dera Temple as an authority on Chinese style painting in the capital.
Although records of the fact that he was engaged in painting around 1473 are existent, no paintings by Sotan have been discovered so far except for the fusuma-e of Yotokuin in Daitoku-ji Temple which Sokei, his son, completed based on what Sotan left unfinished.
Shubun (the years of his birth and death was unknown) was a Zen priest and artist-monk in the middle of the Muromachi period.
His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Tensho.
His secular surname was Fujikura.
While being responsible for the finance of Shokoku-ji Temple as Tsukan, he also served Ashikaga Shogun family as an official painter.
In 1423, he participated in the delegation dispatched to Korea and drew landscape paintings there.
His achievements, such as coloring the Daruma sculpture of Daruma-ji Temple in Kataoka of Yamoto Province in 1430 and traveling to Nara Todai-ji Temple for the purpose of collecting useful information in deigning the Buddhist image of Ungo-ji Temple in 1440, are well-known and he is supposed to have lived until around 1454.
However, works of art which Shubun actually painted do not exist and therefore, his painting style is not clear.
After Shubun died, the position of official painter of the shogun family was succeeded by Sotan Oguri.

Josetsu (the years of his birth and death was unknown) was an artist-monk from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts to the middle of the Muromachi period.
His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Taiko.
It is believed that Chushin ZEKKAI named him after remark of 'Lao-tzu' saying 'Being too skillful is nothing more than being unskillful.'
Although his biography is not so clear, the fact that he engaged in the construction of Soseki MUSO's monument and drew 'Hyonen-zu' (painting of catching Japanese catfish with bottle gourd) from 1384 to 1429 at the behest of Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, 4th shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), is widely known and it is almost certain that he had a close relation with the Ashikaga Shogun family and was a monk of Shokoku-ji Temple.
He was revered by Sesshu, an artist-monk of Shokoku-ji Temple, as a founder and was admitted by the Kano School as the founder of Chinese style painting in Japan.

Hibutsu are Buddhist images that are normally withheld from public view for religious reasons; they are enshrined in zushi (miniature shrines in temples) with the doors closed.
In Buddhist temples, the doors of the Butsudo (Buddhist shrine) are normally open so that the Buddhist image can be seen from outside, but zushi that enshrine hibutsu are usually closed except for a certain period when the hibutsu are unveiled to the public.
The practice of retaining Buddhist images, which were intended as idols for worship, in zushi with the doors closed is quite unique in Japan even among East Asian countries where Buddhism has prevailed.
In this country, hibutsu are often found with Buddhist images that are the principal icons of well-known temples, as well as the temples that are deep-rooted in folk beliefs, including pilgrim stamp offices of the 33 Temples of Saigoku, fudasho (temples where amulets are collected) and those in reijo (sacred ground).
In the following, we'll focus on hibutsu in Japan.
Some hibutsu are so-called 'absolute hibutsu,' which are completely withheld from public view, but most are unveiled to the public on specific days (this practice is called 'gokaicho' or 'kaihi,' both meaning 'opening the gate').
Like the Amida (Amitabha) triad image at Zenko-ji Temple in Nagano, some Buddhist images have never been unveiled to the public; a statue called 'omaedachi,' a copy of the hibutsu (literally, 'standing in front'), is exhibited on the day of 'gokaicho.'
So far, no major progress has been made in the research on when and why hibutsu came into existence; the questions remain unanswered.
At least, there is no record about hibutsu in or before the Nara period.
According to 'Koryu-ji Temple sizai kotai jitsuroku cho,' an inventory list of Koryo-ji Temple's assets (completed around 890), the principal image of its Kon-do hall, 'Reiken-yakushi-butsu' (the Healing Buddha), was placed in the 'naiden' (inner shrine) that can be locked; this reveals that the Yakushi Buddha image was treated as a hibutsu by the end of the 9th century at the latest.
Some say that Shinto (indigenous religion of Japan) shrines may have affected the birth of hibutsu.
The doors of the main hall of a Shinto shrine are usually closed and occasionally opened for special rituals as well (this practice is also seen in kamidana (household Shinto alters) and soreisha (alters that enshrine the souls of ancestors), which are usually closed and opened only for specific services).
Primarily, Shinto gods are invisible.
Although Shinto god images came into existence by the early Heian period under the influence of Buddhist sculpture, they were secretly placed deep inside the shrines as 'go-shintai' (an object of worship) and were seldom unveiled to the public.
It is said that the temples of the Shingon and Tendai Sects have relatively more hibutsu than those of Jodo (Pure Land) Sect and the Zen Sect.
When seen by Buddhist image, hibutsu are more often found with Yakushi Nyorai (Buddha of Medicine and Healing) images, which are often worshipped as the principle image of Esoteric Buddhism temples, and with Kannon Bosatsu (Goddess of Mercy), which includes Juichimen Kannon (Eleven-faced Avalokiteshwara), Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Avalokiteshwara), and Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion), and Fudo Myoo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings); thus, hibutsu are considered to have a bearing on Esoteric Buddhism.
Like Kangiten (Nandikesvara, Ganesh in the Buddhist pantheon) (the figure of a man and a woman with elephant heads and human bodies embracing each other), erotic designs may have been hidden from public view as 'they may have caused the misunderstanding of the doctrine.'
When seen by sect, the temples of the Shingon and Tendai Sects are more relatively to withhold their principle images from public view.
Among the principal images of the major temples of the Tendai Sect, the images of the following Buddhist gods are all treated as hibutsu: Yakushi Nyorai at the Konpon-chudo hall of Enryaku-ji Temple, Shaka Nyorai (Shaka Buddha) at the Saito-shaka-do hall of Enryaku-ji Temple, Miroku Bosatsu (Buddha of the Future) at the Kon-do hall of Onjo-ji Temple (also known as Miidera Temple), and Nyoirin Kannon at the Kannon-do hall of Onjo-ji Temple.
The Ashuku Nyorai (imperturbable Buddha, free from anger, considered identical to Yakushi Nyorai) image, the principal image of the Kon-do hall of Kongobu-ji Temple on Mt. Koya of the Shingon Sect, was destroyed by the fire of 1926 together with the hall that had housed it, leaving the image forever unknown as they had been strictly hidden from public view and no photograph had been taken.
At the temples of the Jodo Sect and Zen Sects, hibutsu are relatively few in number.
But, this does not mean that no hibutsu are found within these temples: Zojo-ji Temple (Minato-ku Ward, Tokyo Prefecture), the main temple of the Jodo Sect, for example, treats the principal image of its Ankoku-den hall, the Amida Nyorai image (commonly known as Kuro-honzon) (literally, black principle image) as a hibutsu.
Some images of Nyorai (Tathagata), Bosatsu (Bodhisattva), Myoo (Vidyaraja), and Tenbu (Celestial beings) are treated as hibutsu, and statues that typically do not fall in the category of 'Buddhist image,' including those of Suijaku (literally, trace manifestation) as Zao Gongen (the highest-ranking deity worshipped in Japanese mountain asceticism), and the Soshizo (sect founder images), as the image of Jianzhen are also treated as hibutsu.
When seen by Buddhist image, Yakushi Nyorai, Kannon Bosatsu, and Fudo Myoo are more likely to be treated as Hibutsu; in general, Buddhist images worshipped at Esoteric Buddhism temples tend to be treated as hibutsu (Yakushi Nyorai, which is an exoteric Buddha, is often worshipped as the principle god of esoteric temples).
Although all pilgrim stamp office of the 33 Temples of Saigoku worship the Kannon images, most of them treat as hibutsu; out of 33 temples, those that treat them otherwise are limited to the following: Minamihokke-ji Temple (Also known as Tsunosaka-dera Temple), the 6th pilgrim stamp office, Ryugai-ji Temple (Also known as Oka-dera Temple), the 7th, Hase-dera Temple, the 8th, and Yoshimine-dera Temple, the 20th.
There are various patterns in which hibutsu are unveiled.
Hibutsu unveiled for a relatively long period in every spring and fall: Kuze Kannon image (the god of salvation) at Horyu-ji Temple and Kisshoten (the goddess of beauty and prosperity) image at Joruri-ji Temple.
Hibutsu unveiled once a month on a specific day: Senju Kannon image at Fujii-dera Temple in Osaka, where the image is unveiled on the 18th of each month, the day believed to have a bearing on the kannon.
Hibutsu unveiled only on one or several days in a year: Shukongoshin (a gate guardian) image at the Hokke-do hall of Todai-ji Temple.
Hibutsu unveiled only once in several years or decades: Senju Kannon, the principle image at Kiyomizu-dera Temple (Kyoto), which is unveiled to the public every 33 years.
Many Kannon images are unveiled 'once every 33 years' because Kannon is believed to save the people by disguising itself into 33 different figures.
Hibutsu not unveiled in principle or those with the exhibition period not determined: Fudo Myoo image at the Goei-do hall of To-ji Temple.
Absolute hibutsu (those not unveiled at all), even with their pictures not disclosed: Juichimen Kannon, the principle image at the Nigatsu-do hall of Todai-ji Temple.
The following are short descriptions of hibutsu considered historically and culturally important.
Kannon Bosatsu (Kuze Kannon) standing statue, the principle image of the Yume-dono hall of Horyu-ji Temple; the hall is the central hall of Toin (the east wing) of Horyu-ji Temple, which was built in the site of Ikaruga no miya (literally, Palace of Ikaruga) operated by Prince Shotoku.
The Kuze Kannon image housed in a zushi placed in the middle of the hall is a wooden sculpture of the Aska period and considered to be the exact image of Prince Shotoku, and according to historical materials, this statue had already been treated as a hibutsu by the 12th century, the late Heian period.
According to the prevailing view, Tenshin OKAKURA (the forerunner of Japanese art educators and researchers) and Ernest Fenollosa (an American philosopher and an art historian), who visited Horyu-ji Temple in 1884 (or 1886), opened the door of the zushi by brushing aside the opposition from Buddhist priests; this is how the Kannon statue came into view for the first time in hundreds of years.
At this time, the statue was covered with a white long cloth.
This story has almost become a legend; some say it unbelievable that the image had been completely kept out of sight for as long as hundreds of years before it was finally opened by Tenshin and Fenollosa.
Amida triad statue, the principle image of Shinshu Zenko-ji Temple; according to a record kept by the temple, the first Buddhist image presented to Japan by Sho Myoo (the King of Kudara, an ancient Korean kingdom) in the 6th century was somehow carried all the way to Nagano to become the principal image of the temple.
This statue, which is known to have been treated as a hibutsu as early as the Kamakura period, is still an 'absolute hibutsu' even today.
However, Zenko-ji Temple made a copy of the hibutsu called 'omaedachi-zo' (an important cultural property built in the Kamakura period, made of bronze), through which people can imagine what the hibutsu looks like.
The Omaedachi-zo statue, made up of Chuson (the principal statue in a group of Buddhist statues) and two Ryowakiji (statues standing at both sides of Chuson) features the Ikko-sanzon (meaning the three icons carrying one large halo) and has characteristics in style, the gods' inso (the shapes expressed with their fingers), the way they are dressed, and the hokan (crowns) worn by the Ryowakiji.
These features are commonly seen in the kondo-butsu statues (gilt bronze Buddhist statues of the Three Kingdoms period of the Korean Peninsula); it is highly likely that the hibutsu of Zenko-ji Temple came over to Japan from the peninsula in quite ancient times.
Amida triad images of so-called 'Amida triad images of Zenko-ji temple-style,' which are seen in temples across Japan, are of the same style.
Zenko-ji Temple has the period of 'gokaicho' (opening the gate) once every 7 years (more precisely, every 6 years, as the year of gokaicho is counted as the first year), and even in that period, it is the 'omaedachi-zo' image, not the hibutsu, that is publicly displayed.
Juichimen Kannon standing statue, the principal image of the Nigatsu-do hall of Todai-ji Temple; the hall locates at the foot of the mountain east of Daibutsu-den (the Great Buddha Hall) and is famous for its water-drawing festival called 'Omizutori.'
Omizutori' is officially called Shunie (a Buddhist mass held in February by the lunar calendar), where people repent and confess all their sins and mistakes to Juichimen Kannon, the hall's principal image, and pray for their happiness and prosperity as well as their country's peace and stability.
An inner room called naijin in the Nigatsu-do hall houses two Juichimen Kannon statues called O-gannon (big kannon) and Ko-gannon (small kannon), both of which have been treated as hibutsu and put under strict control, although it is not known since when they have been treated as such; even priests who perform the 'Omizutori' ritual never get to see them.
However, only the halo of the Kannon which was damaged by the fire of the Nigatsu-do hall in 1667 has been retained in a different place and publicly exhibited (it has been deposited in Nara National Museum).
The halo, made of bronze, 226 cm high, carries the images of many Bosatsu Buddha carved on its surface although it is heavily damaged, and is considered to have been made in the Nara period.
As there are too many hibutsu in Japan, it is impossible to list them all here; we limit them to those that are well-known, including the ones designated as national treasures.

Doki TETSUGYU (August 25, 1628 - October 2, 1700) was a Zen priest of the Obaku School in the early Edo period.
His Go (pen name) was Jibokushi.
His shigo (a posthumous name) was Daijifuo kokushi.
He was born in Nagato Province (some assert that he was born in Iwami Province).
After conducting ascetic training at Ryuho-ji Temple in Inaba Province (Tottori City, Tottori Prefecture), he practiced Zen meditation under the guidance of Ryuki INGEN, who was then staying in Nagasaki City, and was involved in the foundation of Manpuku-ji Temple.
After that, he studied under Shoto MOKUAN, a leading disciple of INGEN, renamed himself Doki TETSUGYU and succeeded Mokuan's teachings.
He endeavored to spread the teachings based on the philosophy of the convergence of teachings and Zen meditation, strove for the construction of Manpuku-ji Temple on Mt. Obaku in Uji, restored Kyoto Rakusei Hamuro Joju-ji Temple and founded Odawara Shotai-ji Temple in Sagami Province and Kofuku-ji Temple in Edo.
He cooperated with Doko TETSUGEN in the publication of 'Daizokyo' (the Tripitaka) and also lent assistance in social work such as the reclamation of Tsubakinoumi sea in Sosa-gun of Shimofusa Province.
Upon the request of people, he later constructed Fukuju-ji Temple (Tosho-machi) (Tosho-machi, Chiba Prefecture) near the place where Tsubakinoumi had been located, and died there.
Doko TETSUGEN (February 12, 1630 - April 27, 1682) was a Zen priest of the Obaku School in the early Edo period.
His shigo (a posthumous name) was Hozo Kokushi.
He was born in Moriyama-mura, Masuki-gun, Higo Province.
Initially, he called himself Tetsugen.
He was born as a son of Joshin SAEKI, who was a Buddhist priest attached to Moriyama Hachiman-gu Shrine.
Initially, he studied Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) due to the influence of his father.
When he entered the priesthood (at the age of 13 years old), his then-mentor was Kaiun, a priest of Jodo Shinshu.
However, as he was ashamed of becoming a high-ranking priest among Hongan-ji Temple priests, thanks to the high status of his temple, irrespective of his talent and virtue, he converted to Zen Sect in 1655 while practicing Zen meditation under Ryuki INGEN and succeeded the teachings of Shoto MOKUAN, a disciple of INGEN.
Thereafter, he founded Zuiryu-ji Temple (Osaka City) in Nanba-mura, Settsu Province.
He endeavored to help residents of Kinai (the region in the vicinity of the capital) who were tormented by starvation and distributed, without stinting, the alms that were donated for the publication of Daizokyo (the Tripitaka).
It is believed that he took such action twice.
"Tetsugen Zenshi Kana Howa" (Buddhist sermon by Tetsugan Zenshi) is a book written for the purpose of preaching the teachings to females.
He didn't decide the successor to his teachings until the end of his life and asked Hoshu, his junior disciple, to take care of the temple.
Thanks to his praiseworthy activities, he was listed in volume 2 of "Kinsei kijin den" (Biographies of Eccentrics of Recent Times).
He swore by Buddha to publish "Daizokyo" in 1664 and collected alms in 1667 by making a pilgrimage throughout the nation.
Although he had given up twice due to the above-mentioned circumstances, he finally succeeded in collecting alms at his third attempt and established Inkyobo (later Baiyo shoin) at Nijo, Kiya-machi, Kyoto, started to carve a woodblock in 1668 based on the Banreki edition of Ming, China, and finally completed it in 1678.
1,618 copies, 7334 volumes.
He reported to the Emperor Gomizunoo.
This Daizokyo is called Obaku edition Daizokyo or Tetsugen edition.
Although its woodblock was carved based on the Banreki edition, no border lines were carved between the lines.
The woodblock has been kept in Hozoin Temple on Mt. Obaku through the ages and Baiyo shoin has been printed as and when requested.
Ryonin (February 26, 1073 ? - February 26, 1132) was a Buddhist priest of Tendai Sect in the late Heian period and the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) Sect.
Shoo Daishi.
He was a son of HATA no Michitake who was a feudal lord of Chita-gun in Owari Province.
His name (良忍) is also written as 良仁 (Ryonin) and his bogo (priest title) was Koseibo or Kojobo.
There exists a view that he was born in 1072.
He became a monk of Jogyozanmai-do Temple of Toto on Mt. Hiei and while engaging in zoyaku (odd jobs), he practiced Fudan Nenbutsu (chanting Nenbutsu throughout the day) under the guidance of Ryoga.
He also succeeded Zennin and Kanzei at school of Endonkai (Perfect and Sudden Precepts) and strove for the restoration of Endonkai.
When he was 22 or 23 years old, he entered a secluded life at Ohara in Kyoto and devoted to praying to Buddha but in the meantime, he founded Raigoin Temple (Sakyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City) and Jorengein Temple (some assert that Jakkoin Temple was also founded by Ryonin) and completed Ohara Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) by unifying the divided Tendai Shomyo.
In 1117, he received the manifestation of Amida-Buddha and created Yuzu Nenbutsu based on the thought that Nenbutsu recited by oneself and others can be united with each other or 'Nenbutsu recited by a person can be nenbutsu for everybody,' and thereafter he advocated rebirth in Jodo (pure land) by means of Shomyo Nenbutsu (Invocation of the Buddha's Name) and made propagation at various places while carrying a meicho (name list) that was to be used for recording the names of people who made a connection with Buddha.
According to the dream of Buddha's oracle that Ryonin had when he confined himself in Shitenno-ji Temple, he founded Shuraku-ji Temple at the residence of SAKANOUE no Hirono, then the feudal lord of Hirano-sho, Sumiyoshi-gun, Settsu Province (present Hirano-ku Ward, Osaka City), and it was the predecessor of Dainenbutsu-ji Temple, the head temple of the Yuzu Nenbutsu Sect.
In 1773, he was granted the shigo (posthumous name) of Shoo Daishi.
Shoshun TOSANOBO (1143 - November 26, 1185) was busho (Japanese military commander) as well as a Buddhist priest in the last Heian period.
Shoshun TOSANOBO was his priest's name and his real name was Konnomaru SHIBUYA.
He was a son of Shigeie SHIBUYA, who belonged to the Chichibu lineage of Kanmu Heishi (the Taira clan).
When Shigeie SHIBUYA, who had been without child for a long time, prayed for the birth of a child, he received the oracle of Kongoyashamyoo (金剛夜叉明王) and was blessed with a baby boy soon and therefore, he named his son Konnomaru (金王丸) using the first and last Chinese characters of 金剛夜叉明王 (Kongoyashamyoo).
He served MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo as a page from his early years.
He accompanied Yoshitomo for the Heiji War in 1159, but after Yoshitomo was defeated by TAIRA no Kiyomori, he went to Owari along with Yoshitomo who left from the battle line.
When Yoshitomo was murdered by Tadamune OSADA in Owari in 1160, he tried to take revenge but failed, and broke through the enemy line by slaying tens of Osada's soldiers while covered all over with wounds.
After returning to Kyoto, he informed Tokiwa Gozen of Yoshitomo's death and thereafter, he entered the priesthood as a priest of Saikon-do of Kofuku-ji Temple in order to pray for Yoshitomo and called himself Shoshun TOSANOBO.
Thereafter, he was captured by Sanehira DOI because he committed an outrage in Hari no sho Manor in Yamoto Province.
However, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, who was also engaged in the Heiji War and remembered Konnomaru SHIBUYA, appreciated Shoshun's loyalty to his father and employed Shoshun as a vassal whilst pardoning the crime.
At the secret behest of Yoritomo, he tried in November of 1185 to assassinate Yoshitsune by assaulting his residence, located at Horikawa in Kyoto, but failed.
Subsequently, he escaped to Mt. Kurama but was captured by Yoshitsune's soldiers and on November 26, he was decapitated at the Rokujo-gawara riverbed and his head was kept on public display.
He died at 43.
Konno Hachiman Shrine (Konno Hachiman-gu shrine)
Shibuya in Tokyo, where Konno Hachiman-jinja Shrine is located, coincides with Yamori no sho Manor of Toshima-gun in Musashi Province that was awarded in 1051 to KAWASAKi no Kaja Motoie of Chichibu Party, who was a grandfather of Shoshin TOSANOBO and insisted that he was a descendant of Prince Takamochi, a grandson of Emperor Kanmu, for his military exploits in Zen Kunen no Eki (Former Nine Years' Campaign).
It is believed that Hachiman-jinja Shrine occupies a part of the site of Shibuya-jo Castle, which used to be the castle of successive Shibuya clans, and it was constructed in 1092 by Motoie KAWASAKI at a corner of the castle.
Even at present, Konnomaru-eido Hall, which enshrines Shoshin TOSANOBO, namely Konnomaru SHIBUYA, is located at the corner of Konno Hachiman-jinja Shrine and next to it, there exists a stone that has been handed down as 'the stone used for the fortress of Shibuya Castle.'

Summary
In the Azuchi-momoyama Period, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, who was then kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor), ordered Nichiren Sect Buddhist monks to attend senso-kuyo (a memorial service conducted by one thousand priests) to be held for the purpose of praying for the repose of his late mother Omandokoro (1595).
At that time, Nichiren Sect's Buddhist monks were split into two groups, namely the Jufuse School that insisted on attending in order to protect the sect, and the Fujufuse School that insisted on refusing attendance in accordance with the religious regulations of Fuju-fuse-gi(nothing could be received or given).
Only Nichio of Kyoto Myokaku-ji Temple refused attendance and left Myokaku-ji Temple.
Further, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA ordered Nichio and Nissho (belonging to the Jufuse School) to hold a debate at Osaka-jo Castle (Osaka Tairon (Debate in Osaka)) and banished Nichio, who didn't bow to authority, to Tsushima Province (1599).
13 years later, Nichio was pardoned and returned to Myokaku-ji Temple.
In the Edo period, Nissen of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu (Jufuse School) complained to bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) that Nichiju of Ikegami Honmon-ji Temple in Musashi Province (Fujufuse School) took believers out of Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu by slandering it (in 1630) and both schools held a debate at the behest of bakufu (Miike Tairon (Debate between Ikegami School and Minobu School)).
At that time, as Kuon-ji Temple on Mt. Minobu had a close relationship with bakufu, including its privilege as motodera (head temple), it took advantage of such a relationship and as a result, the Fujufuse School, which was not appreciated by the ruler from a political standpoint, lost the case and the monks of the school were banished.
Nichio was supposed to be banished to Tsushima again, but as he had already died, his ashes were banished.
Bakufu then banned the Fujufuse School (in 1665), including a ban on terauke (to register with a temple in order to prove their Buddhist faith) (refer to the column on the terauke system) (the ban on terauke by the Fujufuse School), based on 'Tsuchimizu Kuyo-ron' (土水供養論) in which bakufu asserted that the temple's estate was the shogun's offering to a temple and drinking water while walking on a road was also the shogun's offering.
Under such circumstances, some temples, such as Tanjo-ji Temple in Awa Kominato, secretly kept the doctrine of fujufuse by establishing 'Hiden School' (悲田派), which ostensibly compromised with bakufu using the pretext that the temple's estate was a charity to the poor, but such a fact was revealed and the monks involved were banished (in 1691).
Many of the believers of the Fujufuse School concealed themselves in Kazusa Province, Shimofusa Province and Awa Province, which had been Nichiren's home turf and Bizen Province and Bicchu Province (Okayama Domain) where Nichiren Sect believers had increased in the Muromachi period.
Like crypto-Christian, they also were searched severely and once arrested, they were punished or forced to submit written oaths of conversion.
Although the believers of the Fujufuse School depended on other sects or schools for terauke, many of them were actually 'naishin' (内信), those who believed in the Fujufuse School at heart, and some ardent believers were ashamed of depending on other sects or schools for terauke and became 'donors (法立, horyu)' for the Fujufuse School by seceding from the school.
Buddhist monks of the Fujufuse school were called 'hocchu' and they were led by 'hoto' (the light of Buddhism) at each place.
According to the doctrine of the Fujufuse School, as 'naishin' were distinguished from believers of fujufuse and were not allowed to donate offerings directly to 'hocchu,' these 'donors' played the role of mediating between them.
Such strong ties among believers constituted a firm underground organization and the Fujufuse School survived this era thanks to it.
In this period, a dispute arose among the believers of fujufuse in Okayama concerning whether or not 'horyu' were allowed to act as doshi (Lead Chanter) and this dispute became a problem not only in Okayama but in the entire Fujufuse School.
Since then, the school was split into the Fudoshi School (Komon school) which was led by Nikko, who was in exile in Hyuga Province, and the Doshi School which was led by Nichigyo, who was in exile in Sanuki Province, and the former became Fujufuse Nichiren Komon School and the latter became the Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.
After the Meiji Restoration, upon the request for restoration of the school and official government permission for the school's name, which was made by the Fujufuse School led by Shakunissho, the government promulgated (April 10, 1876) the restoration of the Fujufuse School and granted permission for the school's name on the grounds of religious liberty.
Thereafter, Shakunissho founded Ryuge Kyoin Temple in Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture, renamed it Myokaku-ji Temple after Nichio's Kyoto Myokaku-ji Temple and selected it as the head temple of Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect (in 1882).
History
In 1378, Nichijitsu constructed Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (Kyoto Prefecture).
In 1595, Nichio of Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (Kyoto Prefecture) refused to attend senso kuyo, held by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, while asserting fujufusegi and was oppressed.
In 1599, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA ordered Nichio, who was a monk of Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (Kyoto Prefecture) and represented Fujufuse School, and Nichiju, who was a monk of Honman-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) and represented Jufuse school, to hold a debate at Osaka-jo Castle (Osaka tairon) and Nichio was banished.
In 1630, the Tokugawa shogunate ordered the holding of a debate at Edo-jo Castle (Miike tairon) between monks belonging to Fujufuse School, Nichiju of Ikegami Honmon-ji Temple (Tokyo), Nikken of Hokkekyo-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), Nikko of Hondo-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), Nichiryo of Konishi Danrin (a school annexed to a temple) (Chiba Prefecture), Nisshin of Enyu-ji Temple (Meguro-ku Ward, Tokyo) (Tokyo) and Nichiju of Nakamura Danrin (Chiba Prefecture), and those belonging to Jufuse School, Nikkan of Kuon-ji Temple (Yamanashi Prefecture), Nichien of Kuon-ji Temple (Yamanashi Prefecture), Nissen of Kuon-ji Temple (Yamanashi Prefecture), Nitto of Myoko-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), Nichijun of Myohokke-ji Temple and Niccho of Renei-ji Temple (Shizuoka Prefecture), and Nichiju, Nikken, Nikko, Nichiryo, Nisshin and Nichiju were banished.
In 1666, the Tokugawa shogunate issued Tsuchimizu Kuyo Rei (土水供養令, the act for kuyo (Buddhist memorial service) based on the thought that temple estates are regarded as kuyo of shogunate) and based on it, Nikko of Noro Danrin (Chiba Prefecture) was accused of teaching fujufusegi and was banished.
In 1669, the Tokugawa shogunate banned terauke by the Fujufuse School and the school has been oppressed for a long time since then.
In 1871, the Meiji Government abolished the terauke system and the ban was removed.
In 1876, the Meiji Government permitted the restoration of the Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.
In 1941, Myokaku-ji Temple (Okayama City) (Okayama Prefecture) of the Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect and Honkaku-ji Temple (Okayama City) (Okayama Prefecture) of the Fujufuse Nichiren Komon School merged and officially named itself Honge Seishu Sect.
In 1946, Honge Seishu Sect was split into two schools and each of them became independent.
In Sagami Province (Kanagawa Prefecture), the teachings of this school were spread with Myohon-ji Temple in Kamakura being the center of propagation activities.
According to 'Fujufusecho' (literally, the list of Fujufuse temples) compiled in 1667, there were 26 temples as shown below : Rensho-ji Temple (Odawara City), Hosen-ji Temple (Sakawa), Rensen-ji Temple (Itabashi (Odawara City)), Renkyu-ji Temple (Ogikubo (Odawara City)) and Daien-ji Temple (Nuta) in Ashikagashimo-gun, Myorin-ji Temple (Oiso-machi), Myodai-ji Temple (Higashikoiso) and Myosho-ji Temple (Higashikoiso) in Yurugi-gun, Honjo-ji Temple (Funako) in Aiko-gun, Teisei-ji Temple (Tamura), Ryuan-ji Temple (Shimohirama), Ryusei-ji Temple (Ogami), Chogen-ji Temple (Soya), Hogen-ji Temple (Soya) and Rensho-ji Temple (Teradanawa) in Osumi-gun, Myogen-ji Temple (Shimootani), Honzai-ji Temple (Takada), Myoko-ji Temple (Murota), Myoko-ji Temple (Ichinomiya) and Myozen-ji Temple (Fujisawa City) in Koza-gun and Honko-ji Temple (Omachi), Myoten-ji Temple (Koshigoe), Honryu-ji Temple (Koshigoe), Bukko-ji Temple (Fueta), Myocho-ji Temple (Ranbashi) and Enkyu-ji Temple (Tokiwa) in Kamakura-gun.
The above accounts for 68% of branch temples listed in 'Honmatsu cho' (The book of the relation between head and branch temples) compiled in 1633.
(refer to page 353 of Kamakura City, "The History of Kamakura-City, The overview of modern history" Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1990)

Summary
Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect, which tried to observe Nichiren Sect's doctrine of fujufuse, was oppressed severely by bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) through the ban of terauke (to register with a temple in order to prove their Buddhist faith) by Fujufuse School and the illegalization of the religious order itself.
Under such circumstances, the religious order tried to survive by organizing an underground organization consisting of hocchu (Buddhist priest), horyu (法立, believers of fujufuse) and naishin (内信, believers who ostensibly pretended to believe in other sects or schools).
In 1682, however, disputes arose inside the religious order in the Okayama region concerning whether naishin, who ostensibly pretended to be believers of other sects or schools, could be treated equally with pure believers of fujufuse as well as whether horyu could officiate, instead of hocchu, as doshi (Lead Chanter) in Kangyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) for the sake of naishin.
While this internal conflict was spreading from Okayama to the entire Fujufuse School, a group headed by Nikko, who was in exile in Sadohara in Hyuga, and Nichiryu at Tsudera-an Temple of Kurashiki in Bizen insisted that naishin people who were spending a calm and stable life, and the believers of fujufuse who were keeping faith without terauke, even becoming homeless, should be clearly distinguished and horyu should not be allowed to act as doshi.
This group was called the Tsudera School (Fudoshi School) and it has become the Fujufuse Nichiren Komon Sect of which head temple is Honkaku-ji Temple.
On the other hand, a group headed by Nichigyo, who was in exile in Sanuki, and Nitsu at Hisashi-an of Kurashiki in Bizen referred to Nikko who was in exile in Sadohara and refuted by saying 'Although he is in exile, Nikko is spending a peaceful life without worrying about assassination and he cannot understand the feelings of naishin people who are keeping faith while constantly worrying about their lives' (Jokoki (writings about removing Nikko)).
This group was called the Hisashi School (Doshi School) and it has become the Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect of which the head temple is Myokaku-ji Temple (Okayama).

He studied Kenmitsu Buddhism (Exoteric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism), kai (precept) and siddham (Sanskrit) initially under Dengyo Daishi Ennin and after his death, under Hensho.
He tried to travel to China (Tang) in 877 but gave up.
He became Ajari and assumed the position of the head priest of Gankei-ji Temple in 884.
In his later years, he established Godaiin at Mt. Hiei and concentrated in the studies of Tendai Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism.
He strongly emphasized Esoteric Buddhism, which was principally based on 'Dainichi-kyo Sutra' (Mahavairocana Sutra), and completed Taimitsu (esoteric Buddhism of the Japanese Tendai Sect).
Seno IKENOBO (1482 - 1543) was a Buddhist monk of Kyoto Choho-ji Temple (Rokkakudo) as well as a tatebana (flower arrangement) master in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
During 1532 through 1555, he enhanced the Ikenobo School of tatebana to the level of art, systemized tatebana and laid the foundations of the Ikenobo School which later became the mainstream of the Tatebana world.
Senno Kuden,' his oral tradition in his later years, has been inherited for generations, and has been called 'Omaki' as the basis of Ikenobo flower arrangement school and even at present, it is granted to pupils.

History
In 1295, Nichizo constructed Myohorenge-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture).
In 1394, Nikkei reconstructed Myohorenge-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) and renamed it Myoren-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (Kyoto Prefecture).
In 1872, Nichiryumon School merged with other schools of Nichiren Sect under a system in which each sect was allowed only one chief abbot.
In 1874, Nichiryumon School became affiliated with the Shoretsu School of Nichiren Sect.
In 1876, Nichiryumon School officially called itself Happon School and appointing its own superintendent priest and the Shoretsu School of Nichiren Sect was dissolved.
In 1898, Happon School was renamed Honmon Hokke Sect.
In 1941, Honmon Hokke Sect, Honmyo Hokke Sect and Hokke Sect merged together pursuant to the Religious Corporations Act and officially named itself Hokke Sect.
In 1951, Myoren-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (Kyoto Prefecture) became independent from Hokke Sect and officially called itself Honmon Hokke Sect.
Gyoen (the dates of his birth and death are unknown) was a monk in the mid-Heian period.
He was from Kyushu.
Although he had been a hunter in early adulthood, one day after shooting dead a stag that he came across when hunting, he saw a fawn appear out of the blood spurting from the animal's wound, and made up his mind to become a Buddhist monk.
Becoming a hijiri (a high-ranking priest) reciting the Senju Darani Sutra, he built Gyogan-ji Temple (also called Ko-do) on Ichijo, Kyoto in 1004.
Basing himself at this temple, he held several meetings such as Shiju-hachi ko (48 religious association), Shaka ko (religious association of Shkyamuni), Shibu ko (literally, religious association of four parts), and gave people lectures about the Hokke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra).
He attracted many believers of a variety of rank, such as FUJIWARA no Akinobu, a son of FUJIWARA no Michinaga, who became a priest with Gyoen as his mentor.
He also gathered a lot of people to remove stones from the road in Awata in 1016.
He was called kawa-hijiri (hijiri wearing leather) or hisen (皮仙) (unworldly person wearing leather) because he always wore a buckskin.
He carved a statue of the Kannon Deity of Mercy out of a keyaki (zelkova tree) at Kamo-jinja Shrine and enshrined it at Gyogan-ji Temple, and thus the temple was also called ko-do (temple built by kawa hijiri).
Mansai (Also known as Manzei) (1378 – July 17, 1435) was a Buddhist monk of Daigo-ji Temple (Shingon Sect) from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts through the middle of the Muromachi period.
Mansai also went by the title of Hosshinin Jugo (honorary rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress).
As a restorer of Daigo-ji Temple, Mansai was compared with the later Gien Jugo in the Momoyama period.
Mansai's father was Juichii (Junior First Rank) Dainagon (grand councilor) Morofuyu IMAKOJI, and Mansai's mother was Shirakawadono who was a daughter of Geni, Bokan (a priest who served for the families of Monzeki (temple formerly led by founder of sect, temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family)) Hoin (the highest rank among Buddhist priests) of the Seigoin Temple, and served Nariko HINO, the legal wife of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, the third Shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
The Imakoji family, the house where Mansai was born, descended from Yoshifuyu NIJO (a son of Kanpaku Kanemoto NIJO (chief advisor to the Emperor)) and Mansai was the 4th generation grandchild of Kanemoto.
Mansai was adopted by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and studied Buddhism under Sanboin Kenshun to come to enter the Buddhist priesthood under Hooin Ryugen.
Mansai served as the twenty-fifth monzeki (head priest of the temple, formerly led by the sect founder) of the Sanboin Temple, and also held the post of seventy-fourth zasu (temple head priest) of Daigo-ji Temple from 1395 to 1434, creating a precedent for the monzeki of Sanboin Temple concurrently holding the post of zasu of Daigo-ji Temple.
While concurrently holding the two posts, Mansai also served as To-ji choja (the chief abbot of To-ji Temple) and the head priest of Shitenno-ji Temple, and finally rose to Daisojo (head priest of the Buddhist sect) in 1409.
In 1428, Mansai was titled Jusango (Also known as Jusangu) which was the first time the monzeki of Sanboin Temple received the title.
Mansai was proclaimed Jugo, the title equivalent to the Grand Empress Dowager, the Empress Dowager, and the Empress.
Having the confidence of Yoshimitsu and his sons, the fourth shogun Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA and the sixth shogun Yoshinori ASHIKAGA, Mansai was deeply involved in the internal politics and diplomacy of the shogunate government and was nicknamed Kokui no saisho (a priest who has influence in politics).
Mansai contributed so much to the appointment of Shogun Yoshinori by lot (creating Lottery Shogun) that even Shogun Yoshinori, who was a tyrant, did as Mansai suggested on most occasions, feeling his obligation to Mansai.
Getting involved in the corridors of power in the shogunate government, Mansai was cool in assessing the situation and warm in getting on with people, which was appreciated by his contemporaries as 'a loyal retainer of the whole country' ("Kanmon Nikki" (Diary of Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadafusa) by Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadafusa).
Extant Mansai's diary is called "Mansai Jugo Nikki" (Also known as "Hosshinin Jugo-ki," Diary of Mansai) which was recorded on the back of the guchureki (Japanese Lunisolar calendar) from 1411 through the year Mansai died, and the copies written by Mansai are existent.
The diary is now considered as a quite important historical source on the middle of the Muromachi period because Mansai recorded not only prayers as a gojiso of the Muromachi-dono (a priest who protects the public residence of the Shogun) but also the contemporary political circumstances in detail.
Jokei (June 29, 1155 - March 3, 1213) was a Buddhist monk in the Hosso Sect in the early Kamakura period.
He was born in Kyoto.
His grandfather was FUJIWARA no Michinori (Also known as Shinzei), and his father was FUJIWARA no Sadanori.
His go (pen name) was Gedatsu-bo.
He was posthumously titled Gedatsu-shonin by Imperial edict.
He was called himself by Kasagidera Shonin.
He entered the priesthood at Kofuku-ji Temple and studied Hosso Sect Buddhism and Ritsu Sect Buddhism under his uncle Kakuken.
In 1182, Jokei, as a promising learned priest pursuing his studies, passed the Ryugi (oral examination for a novice priest as a gateway to be a Buddhist priest) to serve the Yuimae (big Buddhist Mass) and also served other big Buddhist Mass of Gosaie (ritual for the Sutra of Golden Light performed at the Imperial Palace) and Kinomidokyo (Seasonal reading of the Great Perfection of Insight Sutra).
In 1193, though, Jokei, disgusted at the depravity of the monks, retired from the (official) monk circle to the Kasagi-dera Temple to which he had professed his worship of Miroku (Buddha of the Future, Bodhisattva of the Present).
Thereafter, Jokei further deepened his faith in Miroku by establishing the Ryukokai (literally, gathering of dragon incense) and the Miroku Koshiki (Buddhist rite dedicated to Miroku), while improving the appearance of the Kasagi-dera Temple by constructing the Hannyadai (a monastic building meaning "Wisdom Heights") and the Jusanjunoto (13-storey pagoda).
In 1205, he drew up a report to the throne titled Kofuku-ji Sojo in which he criticized Honen's Senju Nenbutsu (the Single-Minded Recitation of the Nenbutsu) and asked for it to be stopped.
In 1208, he moved to the Kaijusen-ji Temple and also got interested in Kannon (Deity of Mercy) Worship.
Other than 'Gumeihosshinshu' (literally, spiritual awakening of those who are folly and in lost), Jokei wrote many books on the Hosso, the Ritsu, and the Miroku worship.
Bencho (June 27, 1162 - March 23, 1238) was a Buddhist monk in the Jodo Sect from the late Heian period to the Kamakura period.
His father was Norishige FURUKAWA.
His azana (adult males nickname) was Bena.
His priest name was Shoko-bo.
Bencho came from Kazuki in Chikuzen Province (present, Yahatanishi-ku Ward, Kitakyushu City in Fukuoka Prefecture).
He was considered as the founder of the Chinzei school.
Bencho entered the priesthood in 1168 and studied Buddhism on Mt. Hiei, and in 1175, he was given vows to follow jukai (precepts) at the Buddhist ordination platform called Kaidan in the Kanzeon-ji Temple and became a monk in the Tendai Sect.
In 1197, however, he seceded from the sect and became a disciple of Honen.
Afterwards, he returned to his homeland, Chikuzen Province, and founded Nenbutsu Dojo (Buddhist invocation training halls for monks) in Chikugo Province and Higo Province.
Bencho built the Zendo-ji Temple in Yamamoto in Chikugo Province as a main Dojo for training nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) in the Kyushu region, and opened the Ojoin Temple in Shirakawa in Higo Province (Kumamoto City) to found the Chinzei School which would form a mainstream of the Jodo Sect.
Chosai (1184 - February 19, 1266) was a priest of the Jodo Sect in the middle of the Kamakura period.
His father was FUJIWARA no Kuniaki, Iyo no Kami (Governor of Iyo Province).
He was born in Sanuki Province.
His priest name was Kakumyo-bo.
He proceeded to the capital Kyoto at age 9, and became a priest at age 19 to study under Honen.
He resided in Kuhon-ji Temple in Kyoto (Kyoto City) and gave lectures on his own shogyo hongangi (doctrines of single nenbutsu, multiple nenbutsu, multiple practices), making his pupils become known as the Kuhonji School.
He wrote 'Jodo Ehyo kyoron isho mokuroku' (Also known as Chosai-roku, Chosai's bibliographical record (of Jodo Sect)).
Taimitsu is Esoteric Buddhism (Buddhism handed down secretly from general people) handed down by the Tendai Sect.
It is named against Tomitsu (eastern esotericism), which is Shingon Esoteric Buddhism that has To-ji Temple in Kyoto as konpon dojo-seminary (basic hall of training), and was started by Saicho, who was the founder of the Nihon Tendai Sect (Japanese Tendai Sect).
Summary
Tendai Sect is recognized as exoteric Buddhism (teachings by Shaka which are made easy to understand for general people) because it has Hoke-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra) as its basis, or Konpon kyoten (primal scripture), but in the middle of the 9th century when Ennin and Enchin went to Tang and learned Esoteric Buddhism, the Tendai Sect in Japan also began to have the color of Esoteric Buddhism, too, and began to perform incantations of Esoteric Buddhism, and was started to be called Taimitsu.
This is considered as the general opinion.
But the truth is, Taimitsu was founded by Saicho.
Saicho went to Tang and learned mainly Tendai Doctrinal Studies, but it was popular to learn nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation), Zen, Buddhist precepts, and Esoteric Buddhism in China back then.
Saicho brought back those teachings from Jungyo, Esshu, and tried to introduce them into Tendai Doctrinal Studies.
Saicho was trying to establish original doctrinal studies as Japanese Tendai Sect, which has different meanings from Chinese Tendai Sect, but was based on the Chinese Tendai Doctrinal Studies founded by Chigi.
Because of that, the Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei is called the training hall of four sect studies.
Saicho gained the confidence of the Imperial Court, but when Kukai came back the next year with all the teachings of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, he gained the confidence of the Imperial Court instantly, and played an active role, and Saicho realized that what he had learned was only a part of Esoteric Buddhism, and made great courtesy to Kukai, and became Kukai's disciple at Jingo-ji Temple on Mt. Takao with other disciples of his own.
After learning sutra again and again from Kukai as a disciple, Saicho tried to use 'Rishishakukyo' (explanation of Rishu-kyo (Principle of Wisdom Sutra)) but was finally rejected by Kukai, and also, Saicho's best disciple Taihan and other disciples went over to Kukai and did not return back to Mt. Hiei, and for those and other reasons, exchange between Saicho and Kukai disappeared.
Because of that, the aim of Saicho to establish Japanese original doctrinal studies of the Tendai Sect, which is said to be a synthesized Buddhism, with Buddhist precepts, Zen, nenbutsu, and Esoteric Buddhism all combined into Hoke-kyo Sutra, had to be interrupted there.
Further in the present day, the sects that sees Nichiren as the principle Buddha of Mappo (Age of the Final Dharma), determine Chigi and Saicho as marked bosatsu (Bodhisatta) in Zobo Period (Age of the Semblance Dharma) following the general opinion, while they criticize Ennin and Enchin in later history as they made hobo (criticism against one's Buddhism) by introducing Shingon Esoteric Buddhism into Tendai.
But it is clear from historical facts that Saicho himself tried to introduce Esoteric Buddhism into Tendai Doctrinal Studies.
Also, Ennin and Enchin just tried to complete the doctrinal studies of Tendai by re-studying Esoteric Buddhism and introducing it into Tendai Doctrinal Studies, because it was Saicho's desperate desire.
Also, Enchin points out that there are five faults in Kukai's 'Jujushin Ron' (one of Kukai's masterpiece), and argued that 'neither Tendai nor Shingon is better than the other,' so the opinion of the sects that defines Nichiren as the principle Buddha have been completely denied here, too.
Therefore, it is not too much to say that Taimitsu, which is Esoteric Buddhism in the Tendai Sect, was founded by Saicho, and Ennin and Enchin completed the Nihon Tendai Doctrinal Studies.
Later, it split into the Sanmon School, which followed Ennin, and the Jimon School, which followed Enchin.
In Tomitsu, they teach sermons by Kongokai (Diamond Realm) and Taizo (Womb Realm), but in Taimitsu, they teach three great sermons, Taizo, Kongokai, and Soshitsuji (Wonderful Accomplishment).
Nichijo ASAYAMA (? - November 5, 1577) was a Buddhist monk of Nichiren Sect in the Sengoku period (period of warring states).
He is said to have been born in Izumo Province.
Many theories call him Chozan NICHIJO, but there was a younger brother called Saemon ASAYAMA in "Tokitsugu Kyoki" (history book by Sir Tokitsugu).
His surname seemed to be Asayama.
His imina (personal name) was Yoshishige.
He reported to the throne his wish to make temple solicitation for the repair expenses of the ruined Imperial Palace, and was sent a go (name of respect), Nichijo Shonin, by Emperor Gonara.
When Nobunaga ODA entered the capital in 1568, he was appointed by Nobunaga as a mediator for the Imperial Palace, later gained Nobunaga's trust, and was awarded a territory in Ise Province.
He lost in the shuron (religious argument) against Luis Frois and other missionaries in front of Nobunaga, and after, was made a religious enemy of the Society of Jesus.
Also, he failed to entrap Koremasa WADA, who was a Christian, lost Nobunaga's grace, and lost his position around 1573.
Manshuin Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Tendai Sect that is located at Ichijo-ji Temple in Sakyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City.
It does not have a sango (literally, "mountain name," which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple).
Its principal image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), and the founder of the temple was Zesan.
Because it is a monzeki temple (a special temple where the hereditary position of Juji (chief priest), is held by a member of the imperial family or an aristocrat), Manshuin Temple is also known as Takeuchi Monzeki; it is also one of the Tendai Go Monzeki (the 5 major monzeki temples of the Tendai Sect), the other temples being Shorenin Temple, Sanzenin Temple (Kajii Monzeki), Myohoin Temple, and Bishamon Do Temple.
Its many cultural properties include the Ki Fudo (a hanging scroll of a Buddhist god known as the Yellow Fudo (Acala)) and the Manshuin Bon Kokin Wakashu (the Manshuin Temple version of Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), both of which are national treasures.
It is the seventeenth Fudoson (Acala) of the 36 Kinki Fudoson.
Like other Tendai monzeki temples, a bo (small temple) that began on Mt. Hiei during time of Saicho (767 - 822) is said to be the origin.
Afterward, it moved its base to Kitayama (around present day Rokuon-ji Temple in Ukyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City) in around the twelfth century, moved inside the capital (around present-day Shokoku-ji Temple in Kamigyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City), and it was in 1656 that it moved to its present location.
The temple history states that a bo ran by Dengyo Daishi Saicho up on Mt. Hiei is the origin.
After Ennin and Anne, at the time of Zesan in the later half of the tenth century, it moved to Kitadani in Saito (Western Section), which is one of the Hieizan Santo (The three temple precincts on Mt. Hiei), and named Tobi-bo.
Saicho, Ennin, and Anne, are names representing religious lineage of Buddhism in Tendai Sect, and it can be said that the history of Manshuin virtually begin in the period of Zesan.
It is not very clear about Zesan's achievements, but it is said that he was a disciple of Emperor Kazan (968 - 1008).
Manshuin Temple, ever since the Heian period until the end of the early-modern period, had intimate relations with Kitano-jinja Shrine (present day Kitano Tenmangu Shrine), and successive monshu (head priest) of Manshuin Temple also assumed the position of betto (the superior of a temple) of Kitano Shrine.
There is a common opinion saying that since Zesan, the first monshu of Manshuin, was from the Sugawara clan, he was appointed as the betto of Kitano-jinja Shrine, which holds Michizane SUGAWARA as enshrined god, when it was constructed (in 947).
Further, there is another theory about the appointment of Zesan stating that it was not when Kitano-jinja Shrine was constructed, but that he was appointed as head priest when Emperor Ichijo made Gyoko (Emperor's visit) to Kitano-jinja Shrine (in 1004).
When considering that there are seventy years difference between the year which is said to be the construction year of Kitano-jinja Shrine (947) and the year Zesan died (1018), it is likely that the theory stating that the appointment was in 1004 is more appropriate.
In the era of Tennin (1108 - 1110), at the time of Chujin, who was the 8th monshu counting from Zesan, betsuin (a sub temple) was constructed at Kitayama (present day Ukyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City) not far from Kitano-jinja Shrine, and the name of the temple was changed to 'Manshuin Temple.'
It is believed that the reason he constructed betsuin was for convenience to manage Kitano-jinja Shrine.
Honbo (main bo) on Mt. Hiei and betsuin at Kitayama were both operated at the same time for a while, but gradually betsuin at Kitayama became the main temple.
Manshuin Temple, located at Kitayama, had to be moved for the construction of Kitayamaden (later Rokuon-ji Temple) by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and moved inside the capital Kyoto in the era of Koryaku (1379 - 1381).
The new location was at the south of Shokoku-ji Temple, present inside the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden in Kamigyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City.
In around 1495, after Cloistered Imperial Prince Jiun of Daisojo (high priest), who was the son of Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadatsune and an adopted child of Emperor Gotsuchimikado, became the twenty-sixth monshu and entered the temple, it became a custom for a member of the Imperial family to serve as a monshu in Manshuin Temple, and the position as miya-monzeki (temples headed by imperial princes) was established.
It was the twenty-ninth monshu Imperial Prince Yoshinao (Imperial male who received Imperial proclamation for shinno after becoming a priest) who moved Manshuin Temple to the foot of Mt. Higashi mountain, the present day location, and fixed the view of the temple.
The moving of Manshuin Temple to the present location was in 1656, and Oshoin (Also known as hondo (main hall)) and Koshoin (small study) that exist now were made at that time.
It is said that this place, like Manshuin Temple, was one of the small bo on Mt. Hiei, and was a site of Getsurin-ji Temple, where Kangakue (an association for prayers) was started by YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane and others, but later disbanded.
Imperial Prince Yoshinao was the second son of Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito, who was famous for building Katsura Rikyu (Katsura Imperial Villa), and was a adopted child of Emperor Gomizunoo.
Imperial Prince Yoshinao was not only a Buddhist who served as Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai Sect), but also was a cultivated person who was familiar with Sado (tea ceremony), Kado (flower arrangement), Kodo (traditional incense-smelling), waka (a 31-syllable Japanese poem), Shodo (calligraphy), and landscape gardening, and the influence that he had on the culture of the time was great.
The cultural properties handed down in Manshuin Temple, such as chashitsu (tea room), Kokindenju archive (archive to hand down the secrets of Kokin Wakashu), and Tatebana Zu (a sketch of Tatebana, or decorated flowers, made by Senko IKENOBO, who was the 2nd head of Ikenobo School), shows how broad the Imperial Prince's hobbies and educational knowledge were.
Its precinct is located at the western foot of Mt. Hiei.
The walls of both the right and left side of Chokushi-mon gate (the gate for the Imperial Envoys), which is the entrance, are tsukiji walls (walls made with mud) with 5 horizontal lines, showing the high formality of the temple as a monzeki temple.
Main constructions are Entrance hall, Oshoin, Koshoin, kuri (monastery kitchen), and goma-do Hall (a hall for the goma (holy fire) rites).
There is no main butsudo (Buddhist temple), and the principle image is enshrined at the butsuma (the room where the family Buddhist altar is placed) in Oshoin.
Karesansui (dry landscape) garden is said to have been made by Enshu KOBORI.
Oshoin (Also known as hondo) - constructed in 1656.
It is also called 'hondo' (main hall) since the principle image, the standing statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), is enshrined at the butsuma, but from bokusho (writing in India ink) and other articles found when repairing with dismantling, it is understood that it was called 'Oshoin' at the time of construction.
It is a residential-like construction with yosemune-zukuri (a square or rectangular building, covered with a hipped roof) and kokerabuki (roofed with shingles).
There is 'Jussetsu no ma' (room of Ten Snow) at the east side from the front, 'Taki no ma' (room of Waterfall) at the west side, behind 'Jussetsu no ma' is 'butsuma,' and behind 'Taki no ma' is 'Hika no ma' (a waiting room).
Concrete shapes such as gourds and fans are designed to sugido (sliding doors made of cedar) in the construction, and the common sense design can be seen with the goten (palace) of Katsura Rikyu.
The wooden seated statue of Jikei Daishi (important cultural property) is enshrined at tokonoma (alcove) in 'Jussetsu no ma,' and other statues of Buddha, with the principle image of Amida Nyorai in the center, are enshrined in butsuma.
Koshoin - stands at the north-eastern side of Oshoin (hondo).
It was constructed at the same time as Oshoin, and has yosemune-zukuri and kokerabuki.
It has 'Fuji no ma' (room of Mt. Fuji) at the south-eastern side and a main fort 'Tasogare no ma' (room of twilight) with toko (alcove) and tana (shelf) in the north of its layout, and the western side of the construction is divided into several small rooms including 2 jo no chashitsu (tea room in 3.3 square meters area).
The tana at the side of tokonoma of 'Tasogare no ma' is made with several kinds of wood, and is known as 'Manshuin Temple-dana.'
The fretwork of ranma (transom) at the border of 'Fuji no ma' and 'Tasogare no ma' and kugikakushi (object which conceals the head of nail) with cloisonne ware, are also the characteristics of this construction.
There is another chashitsu, not the 2 jo no chashitsu mentioned above, attached to the north side of Koshoin, and it is known as 'Hassoken' (literally, house of eight windows).
Hassoken - chashitsu adjoining the north side of Koshoin.
It is believed that it was constructed at the same time as Oshoin and Koshoin.
It is hirasanjodaime (6.19 square meters (3 tatami mats and one daimedatami (three-quarters tatami mats)) with tatami mats laying in wide plan) and gezadoko-no-seki (name of layout of chashitsu when tokonoma is behind the position of the host).
Designs of Enshu KOBORI style can be seen here and there.
Renjimado (a window with vertical or horizontal wooden laths or bamboo) above nijiriguchi (small door which leads into a tea ceremony hut) is especially famous for it makes a shadow like a rainbow.
Color painting on silk, a portrait of Fudo Myoo (Ki Fudo (Yellow Cetaka)) - one of the portraits produced based on Ki Fudo Zo (produced in the early Heian period) located in Enjo-ji Temple (Miidera Temple) in Shiga Prefecture, and is estimated to have been produced in around the twelfth century, in the late Heian period.
Deposited at the Kyoto National Museum.
Kokin Waka Shu (Manshuin-bon (Manshuin Temple version)), 1 volume - a manuscript copy of Kokin Wakashu written on dyed paper with different colors with elegant Japanese style handwriting, and is an article that goes back to the eleventh century.

Gishin (born 781, died August 26, 833) was an early Heian-period Buddhist monk of the Tendai sect.
His secular name was either Maruko MURAJI or Maruko BE..
He was a native of Sagami Province.
He was called Shuzen Daishi (the Great Teacher of Mastering Meditation (Dhyana)).
At Kofukuji temple in Nara he studied the Hosso sect of Buddhism and was sworn to obey the precepts by a disciple of Ganjin; he could also communicate in Chinese.
After this stage he became the disciple of Saicho, and in 804 he crossed over to Tang China with Saicho as an interpreter of Chinese; he returned to Japan after receiving both the Endon precepts from Daosui (a Chinese Tiantai (Tendai) monk) and the dharmic transmission of Vajrayana (esoteric) rituals from Shunxiao, exactly as Saicho did.
In 822, after Saicho passed away, Gishin became the first priest in charge of transmitting the precepts at the Mahayana Buddhist ordination platform of Mt. Hiei.
In 824 he assumed the position of the Head Priest of Tendai, becoming the first such head priest, and also participated in the Yuima-e (Buddhist debates) as a lecturer in 832; this was the first time a priest designated as a member of the Tendai sect had done so.
His written works include the 'Tendai Hokkeshu Gishu' (Collected Teachings of the Tendai Hokke (Lotus) Sect).
Taihan (778-?) was an early Heian period Buddhist monk of the Shingon sect.
It is unknown where he was born, though one theory claims he was from Omi Province.
After joining the Buddhist priesthood at Gango-ji Temple in Nara, he became a disciple of Saicho.
In 810, together with Saicho, he created the Three Precepts of Buddhist law on Mt. Hiei, and established rules for dwelling at temples.
In July and August 812, as a result of Saicho having fallen ill, he was appointed the head priest of all of Mt. Hiei, but internal strife among the clergy of the mountain (Taihan irritated the clergy with his personal inconveniences, so he asked Saicho for a leave of absence, and permission to depart from the mountain) caused him to seclude himself from the world on Takashima island in Omi Province.
Saicho took Taihan with him to go twice to visit Kukai and persuade him to bestow the dharmic succession ritual of the Diamond Realm on him, but Taihan refused (this led Saicho to go in 812 without Taihan, accompanied by other disciples, to see Kukai, who then granted him the dharmic succession ritual of the Diamond Realm).
On January 23, 813, Taihan, along with Saicho and others, did receive the succession ritual of the Womb Realm from Kukai at Takaosan-ji Temple (Jingo-ji Temple), and thereafter became a disciple of Kukai.
On April 14, 813, he also received the succession ritual the Diamond Realm.
Thereafter, Saicho--recognized as Kukai's favorite pupil, and groomed as his successor--tried to press Taihan into returning over and over to Mt. Hiei, but Taihan did not in fact return.
In the end, it is said that Kukai had Taihan write a letter and sent it off to Saicho.
This struggle over Taihan, as well as Saicho's views on esoteric Buddhist ritual, among other factors, eventually led to a separation between Saicho and Kukai.
Nonetheless, it is said that to the very end Saicho never gave up his quest to have Taihan return to Mt. Hiei.
In 816, Taihan established temporary residence at Otokuni-dera temple, and when Kukai established the monastery of Mt. Koya, Taihan, along with Kukai's other disciple Jichie, worked hard, climbing the mountain and erecting a thatched hut.
In 837, when Taihan would have been about 60, his name appears on a document of Buddhist precepts as one of the established monks of To-ji Temple, but thereafter nothing is known of what became of him.
Taihan was one of the Ten Great Disciples of Kukai, and is counted as one of the Four Sages, but because very little is known of his priestly career, he is frequently considered as on a par with Kojo, another disciple of Saicho's, but this comparison is considered an error.
Jichie (also pronounced Jitsue, born 786, died December 24, 847), was an early Heian-period Buddhist priest of the Shingon sect.
His secular origin was as a member of the Saeki clan; he was born in Sanuki Province, and was related to Kukai.
He was also known as Kinoo Sozu ('Father Kinoo') and Doko Daishi (Doko the Great Teacher).
He became the first abbot of To-ji Temple.
He studied the Yuishiki theory (of vijnapti matrata, the theory that everything exists only in the mind) of the Hosso sect with Taiki, a priest of Daian-ji Temple in Nara, and in 807 took Buddhist vows, receiving the succession ritual from Kukai in 810.
In 812 he assumed the position of Sango (the Three Offices) of Jingo-ji Temple on Mt. Takao, and starting in 816, he began to assist Kukai in founding the monastery on Mt. Koya.
He established the temple of Kanshin-ji Temple (in the city of Kawachinagano in Osaka Pref.) in 827.
In 836 he became head priest of To-ji Temple, and afterwards established a second head priest position at To-ji Temple.
At the same time, he founded the Kanjoin sub temple at To-ji Temple, which served as the training hall for the Kechie kanjo (Dharma transmission) of Shingon Buddhist teachings and rituals.
In 845, he sold the Shugei Shuchiin, the school Kukai had founded in 828, and with the income from that and the revenue from his shoen (private estate) in Oyama in Tanba Province, he began to hold Buddhist religious assemblies at To-ji Temple.
Encho (772-837) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the first part of the Heian period.
He was born into the Mibu clan.
He came from Saitama County in Musashi Province.
It was under Dochu of the Kanto region that he first entered the Buddhist priesthood and took the name Hokyo but went on to study under Saicho of Mt. Hiei in the year 798 and change his name to Encho.
In the year 806, he received the Endonkai (Precepts for Perfect and Immediate Enlightenment) from Saicho and his aptitude led to him being given the opportunity to recite the second volume of the Lotus Sutra following Saicho at a Hokke Choko (long recitation of the Lotus Sutra) in the year 807.
Encho was appointed as the second Tendai Zasu (head priest of the Tendai Sect) in the year 833 before establishing Saito-in Temple and Jakko-in Temple on Mt. Hiei.
He also recommended that Empress Dowager Tachibana no Kachiko make an offering of several hundred Buddhist surplices to Guoqing Temple on China's Mt. Tiantai.
Gien (October 1, 1558 - June 15, 1626) was a Shingon Sect Buddhist monk who lived from the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan) to Edo period.
His father was Haruyoshi NIJO and his mother was Ishi NIJO, daughter of Imperial Prince Fushimi-no-miya Sadaatsu.
He became the adopted son of Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA, 15th Shogun of the Ashikaga Shogunate.
Gien entered the Buddhist priesthood in 1571 and studied under Gyojo of the Risei-in sub-temple of Daigo-ji Temple, and revived Kongorin-in Temple, anther of Daigo-ji Temple's sub-temples, in 1575.
He was appointed the 80th head priest of Daigo-ji Temple in 1576, made Daisojo (High Priest) in 1579, given the imperial title of Jusango (honorary rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress) in 1585, and promoted to chief abbot of To-ji Temple in 1594.
During Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's Bunei-Keicho War (invasion of Korea), he conducted Benevolent Kings Wisdom Sutra services at To-ji Temple.
He was revered by emperors, retired emperors and the samurai class alike, and Hideyoshi in particular visited Daigo-ji Temple regularly.
It was also with the Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and his son Hideyori that Gien revived the Sanbo-in sub-temple of Daigo-ji Temple.
Shuen (771 - July 16, 835) was a Hosso Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the first part of the Heian period.
He was born into the Kodani clan.
He came from Kitatani in Yamato Province.
He is also known as Teisho Zenji.
Shuen studied the Hosso Sect teachings under Kenkei of Kofuku-ji Temple in Yamato Province, served as one of the overseeing monks during the service celebrating the completion of Konpon Chudo Hall on Mt. Hiei in the year 794, and was consecrated by Saicho in the year 805.
He became a preceptor in the year 810 and betto of Kofuku-ji Temple in 812, following which he constructed Denpo-in Temple within the precinct of Kofuku-ji Temple where he began conducting Shinmitsue.
In the year 827, he was promoted to the rank of Shosozu (junior secondary prelate).
He is not the same 'Shuen' who studied the Tendai Sect teachings under Gishin before declaring himself Tendai Zasu (Chief Tendai Sect Abbot) after his master's death in the face of opposition from sect followers, reside at Murosan-ji Temple in Yamato Province, and give rise to so-called 'Muro Tendai' (refer to the works of Hidenori TSUJI).
Shuen was also close to Kukai, which indicates that he had an understanding of Tendai Sect and Shingon Sect Buddhism which were both new to Japan at the time.
Enkan (September 1, 1281 - April 2, 1356) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the latter part of the Kamakura period and the Northern and Southern Courts period.
His alias was Echin.
This name is often written using simplified kanji.
He was also given the alias 'Gokoku Daishi' after having received precepts from Emperor Gofushimi, Emperor Hanazono, Emperor Godaigo, Emperor Kogon and Emperor Komyo.
Enkan was born in Imanishi-sho, Azai County, Omi Province (modern-day Imanishi, Kohoku-cho, Higashiazai-gun, Shiga Province).
He was ordained at Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei in 1295 where he studied the Endonkai (Precepts for Perfect and Immediate Enlightenment) Mahayana precept.
However, he was not satisfied and eight years later left Mt. Hiei to establish Ritsu-in Temple (Geno-ji Temple) in Kitashirakawa with his master Koen, where he worked to enhance his understanding of the Endonkai precept.
The devotion of Emperor Godaigo led to him being appointed Kanjin (position in charge of collecting donations for the temple) of Hossho-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1326 which he worked to restore and was allowed to reside in as reward for his success.
Along with others including Monkan and Chuen, he participated in Emperor Godaigo's plot to overthrow of the shogunate; recruiting warrior monks from temples such as Enryaku-ji Temple, Todai-ji Temple and Kofuku-ji Temple, and praying for the spiritual safety of the Hojo clan.
When the plot to over throw the shogunate was discovered in 1331, he was captured in Rokuhara and exiled to Mutsu Province.
During the Kenmu Restoration, he was pardoned, allowed to return to Hossho-ji Temple and appointed Daikanjin (position in charge of collecting donations for the temple) of Todai-ji Temple but worked for the Northern Court after the imperial line split into the Northern and Southern Courts.
Many of his surviving writings relate to the Endonkai precept.
It is also due to the efforts of Enkan that places of Endonkai precept study were established at the Engoku Shikaidan (Hokai-ji Temple in Kamakura, Yakushi-ji Temple in Kaga Province, Tomyo-ji Temple in Iyo Province and Chinko-ji Temple in Tsukushi Province).
Enkan's system (Echin Monryu) was passed on to monks including Koshu, Yuiken and Unkai, and although part of the Tendai Sect, is thought to have existed as separate group from Enryaku-ji Temple until the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States).
Jojin (1011 - November 9, 1081) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the mid-Heian period.
His father was Mutsu no kami (the governor of Mutsu Province), FUJIWARA no Sanekata's son, FUJIWARA no Sadanobu.
His mother was Jojin Ajari no Haha, poet and daughter of MINAMOTO no Toshikata who wrote 'Jojin Ajari no haha no shu' (A collection of poems by mother of Jojin Ajari).
He is also known as Zene Kokushi.
He entered the Buddhist priesthood aged seven years when he studied under Monkyo of Daiun-ji Temple in Iwakura, Kyoto before receiving the knowledge of Taimitsu (esoteric Buddhism of the Tendai Sect) from Goen, Gyoen and Myoson.
In 1041, he was appointed betto of Daiun-ji Temple (Kyoto City).
He became the Acharya (preceptor) of Enryaku-ji Temple's Soji-in sub-temple, and was appointed the gojiso (a priest who prays for protection) of FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.

He was granted an audience with Emperor Shenzong (of Song Dynasty China) and was given the name Zene Daishi after mastering rainmaking prayer.
In addition, he introduced the travel journals of Ennin and Chozen as well as monk Eshin Sozu Genshin's "Ojoyoshu" (The Essentials of Rebirth in the Pure Land) to China, and sent over 600 scrolls including sutras to Japan.
He attempted to return to Japan but was kept in China by Emperor Shenzong, and passed away at Kaibao Temple in Bianjing.
His travel diary entitled "Santendai Godaisanki" consists of eight volumes.
A so-do hall is a temple building dedicated to the communal living of practitioners (monks) and the promotion of ascetic practices.
These halls are also known as "un-do" due to the presence of the monks, and also called "senbutsu-do" (lit. choosing Buddhism hall) after the fact that the practitioners have chosen a life of Buddhism.
So-do halls are often found at Zen temples.
These halls usually function as places in which monks practice Zazen and take their meals, although meals are sometimes take in a separate shoku-do (dining hall) in Rinzai Sect temples.
In such cases, the so-do hall is referred to as the zen-do hall.
Also, the training institutions in which monks must spend a certain amount of time training before they qualify as a chief priests in Japanese Zen Buddhism are known as senmon so-do (lit. specialist so-do halls).
During the Indian age of Buddhism, the collection of buildings in which monks lived was called so-do but this definition is now covered by the words a temple or monastery.
The form of so-do halls seen today is thought to have been established with the Shingi (daily regulations of Zen temples) founded in Tang Dynasty China by Baizhang Huaihai.
A system was later developed by Chongsheng Temple on Mt. Xuefeng, Wanshou Temple on Mt. Jing and the temples on Mt. Tiantong. and this was later transmitted to Japan during the Song Dynasty.
The first so-do hall in Japan is believed to be that of Kosho-ji Temple (Uji City) which was established by Dogen, founder of the Japan Soto Sect.
So-to halls went on to be constructed throughout Japan following the geographical spread of Zen Buddhism, and they continue to be used as places of ascetic practice at temples including Eihei-ji Temple and Kencho-ji Temple.
The so-do hall is one of the seven principal buildings considered necessary for a Zen Buddhist temple, and it is situated opposite the kuri (monks' living quarters) with the straight line consisting of the sanmon gate, butsuden (main hall) and hodo (lecture hall) between them, on the left when the butsuden is observed from the sanmon gate.
So-do halls are generally rectangular in shape with a central entrance on one side.
There are so-do halls with not one but two entrances where one entrance is opposite the other.
The entrance does not have a door but generally just an opening.
However, the doorway may be covered by a sudare (bamboo screen) or curtain during the summer and winter.
There is ordinarily a seated statue of a holy monk placed in the center facing the entrance.
The Manjusri of Mahakasyapa incarnation of Gautama Buddha are chosen as this holy monk.
It is strictly forbidden to pass in front of the holy monk statue.
The 'tan' which serve as places for practicing Zazen and living space for each monk are arranged along the walls as if surrounding the holy monk.
Each tan is the size of one tatami mat.
Where there is additional interior space, tan are placed in the central space at both sides of the holy monk statue.
The tan closest to the entrance is called the 'tanto' and is where the shiso (so-do hall preceptor) sits.
There are also instances in which tan, referred to as 'gaitan' (lit. outer tan), are arranged around the exterior wall of the building, whereas those on the inside are called 'naitan' (lit. inner tan).

Yukai (1345 - August 10, 1416) was a Shingon Sect priest scholar who lived from the Northern and Southern Courts period (Japan) to the mid-Muromachi period.
His father is believed to have been FUJIWARA no Sanemitsu but this is not known for certain.

His full name is Yu Amidabutsu.
He became the disciple of Taa, a direct disciple of Yugyo Shonin, and resided at Shojoko-ji Temple in Sagami Province where he immersed himself in research into the 'Manyoshu.'
In 1365, he was invited by Kanpaku (chief advisor for the emperor) Yoshimoto NIJO and in the following year travelled to Kyoto year where he lectured on the 'Manyoshu' and authored 'Shirin Saiyo-sho' (Commentary of Leaves from a Forest of Words).
He was aged 74 years at the time.
Following in the footsteps of Sengaku, he conducted empirical research and wrote works including "Shui Saiyo-sho" (Commentary of Leaves of Gleanings) and "Seiyo Tanka-sho" ("Green Leaves and Red Flowers," a Collection of Poetry).
Taa (1237 - February 18, 1319) was a Ji Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the latter part of the Kamakura period.
He was the direct disciple of Yugyo Shonin.
His full name is Ta Amidabutsu but this is abbreviated to Taa.
His priest name was Shinkyo (although this does not appear in contemporary sources and its first recorded usage is in "Honcho Kosoden" (biography of high ranking monks by Mangen Shiban).
Books signed "Shinkyo" are kept at the Toshin Bunko Library, and some theories identify this individual as Taa.
It is said that he was born into the Koga family of the Minamoto clan but there is a possibility that this is a false claim that was made after his death.
After becoming the disciple of Ji Sect founder Ippen in 1277 in Kyushu, he accompanied him on his travels around Japan.
He reformed the Ji Sect which had temporarily disbanded following Ippen's death in 1289, and continued his journey around the Hokuriku and Kanto regions.
In 1304, he passed the role of travelling to the third generation Ji Sect disciple Ryoa (also known as Chitoku.
Later inherited the name Taa), and constructed a thatched hut (which went on to become the Muryoko-ji sub-temple of Konko-in Temple Toma dojo-seminary) in Sagami Province where he lived alone until his death.
The precinct of this temple contains a Hokyoin-to pagoda (Japanese stupa) under which Taa is buried alongside Ippen.
In addition to Ryoa, other important disciples included Yua (also known as Eei or Eiko.
Later became Taa Donkai who opened the Fujisawa-dojo seminary), and Joa (Shinkan) of the Kyoto Shijo-dojo seminary.
As well as extensive information about him being later compiled in volume 8 of "Taa Jonin Hogo" (Buddhist sermon of Taa Jonin), he mixed with eminent members of Kyoto Society as a poet, and published his work in a compilation entitled "Daikyo-shu."
His biography is detailed in "Ippen Shonin Eshiden" (Yugyo Shonin Engi-e) volumes 5-10.
Well known images of Taa include the painting at Nagasaki Shonen-ji Temple (Sakai City, Fukui Prefecture), the wooden seated statue at Higashiyama Choraku-ji Temple (Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City), and the wooden seated statues at Kurokoma Shogan-ji Temple (Fuefuki City, Yamanashi Prefecture) and Kozu Rentai-ji Temple (Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture), all of which have been designated Important Cultural Properties.
These images are unique among such works as a stroke suffered in his final years left the shape of his mouth distorted.
Ippen named Jokai, who is also said to have been a blood relative, as his successor but after he passed away, the Ji Sect disappeared throughout Japan.
Taa revived the sect, established the 'Jishu Seikai' (religious commandments of the Ji Sect) and 'Dojo Seibun' (rules for priests) which advocated Chishiki Kimyo (a unique belief of the Ji Sect of giving absolute devotion of mind and body to the absolute view of knowledge), and sources state that there were over 100 subordinate temples.
The modern Ji Sect was established in early modern times when the Fujisawa-dojo seminary Shojoko-ji Temple, which followed this Taa system, absorbed other nenbutsu denominations.
Successive high priests of the Ji Sect have been named Taa.
However, only Taa Shinkyo can be considered an actual founder of the Ji sect.
He is commonly called 'Niso Shonin' (lit. Second Founder) in relation to the sect founder Ippen, and his statue stands alongside that of Ippen at many Ji Sect temples.
Shubin (dates of birth and death unknown) was a monk in the early Heian period.
His birthplace was unknown.
He was called Shubin Sozu (high-ranking priest).
He learned the Three Shastras (Three Treatises) and the Hosso (Dharma Characteristics school) from Gonso of Iwabuchi-dera Temple in Yamato Province among others, and had thorough knowledge of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism.
When Emperor Saga granted To-ji Temple to Kukai and simultaneously granted Sai-ji Temple to Shubin in 823.
Having been a rival in most matters with Kukai, the monk of To-ji Temple, on being defeated by him in a competition for inducing rainfall by prayer when a draught hit in 824, he shot an arrow at Kukai, but its path was interrupted by a Jizo Bosatsu (Jizo Bodhisattva).
The 'Yatori Jizo' (Jizo Bosatsu which protected Kukai from the arrow) is now enshrined beside the site of the demolished Rasho-mon Gate.
It is believed that Sai-ji Temple gradually fell into ruin in those days as a result.
Myoun (1115 - January 3, 1184) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the late Heian period.
His father was MINAMOTO no Akimichi.
His priest titles were Enyubo and Jiunbo.
He studied exoteric Buddhism and esoteric Buddhism from Benkaku Hoin of Mt. Hiei, and inherited the teachings of Tendai Zasu (head priest of the Tendai Sect) Imperial Prince Saiunho.
In 1166, he was promoted to the rank of Sojo and appointed Tendai Zasu in 1167.
He had a close relationship with TAIRA no Kiyomori and acted as kaishi (the priest who imparts the Buddhist commandments) when he entered the Buddhist priesthood.
In 1177, he took the blame for a conflict between the Enryaku-ji Temple's sub-temple of Hakusan and the governor of Kaga Province, which led to him losing his position as Tendai Zasu and being exiled to Izu Province but he was rescued en route by Buddhist followers and returned to Mt. Hiei.
After the system of cloistered government was ended by what is known as the 'Coup of the Third Year of Jisho' in 1179, Myoun was once again appointed Tendai Zasu and promoted to the rank of Daisojo (highest rank of a Buddhist monk) in 1182.
As the gojiso (personal monk) of the Taira clan, he participated in the Taira clan government and the administration of Enryaku-ji Temple but stayed behind at Enryaku-ji Temple when the Taira clan left the capital.
Myoun was killed in 1183 during the Battle of Hoju-ji Temple when MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka attacked Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa.
Yoshinaka held up the head of Myoun and said 'He was nothing.' before throwing it into Nishi no Toin-gawa River.
Despite the fact that Myoun was a Buddhist monk of the highest level, he took human lives on the battlefield before finally dying in battle himself, and Jien, who received religious precepts from him, was highly critical of this in his work entitled "Gukansho."
On the other hand, "Imakagami" (The Mirror of the Present) praised Myoun by stating that 'there will not another Zasu to rival him for a long time to come.'
Kakuen (1031 - May 19, 1098) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the latter part of the Heian period.
His father was FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.
He is also known as Uji no Sojo.
Kakuen entered the Buddhist priesthood and studied exoteric Buddhism and esoteric Buddhism under Myoson of Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple).
He was promoted to the rank of Gon no Shosozu in 1054, appointed Chori (chief priest) of Onjo-ji Temple in 1063, and made Daisojo (highest rank of a Buddhist monk) in 1065.
In 1077, he was appointed Tendai Zasu (head priest of the Tendai Sect) by imperial charter but was forced to resign after only three days in the face of opposition from the followers of Enryaku-ji Temple; being made betto (administrator) of Hossho-ji Temple instead.
He later conducted esoteric prayer rituals at the imperial palace and it is said that he performed amazing miracles.
He had the deep trust of the imperial court as well as nobility, and was granted "gissha no senji" (special permission from the emperor to enter the imperial palace in an ox-drawn cart) in January 1096.
Recent investigations have led to debate over the theory that he died in the year 1099.
Raigo (1002 - 1084) was a Japanese monk of the Tendai sect in the mid Heian period.
His father was FUJIWARA no Ariie, Iga no kuni no kami (Governor of Iga Province).
He lived in Jissoin Temple, studied under Shinyo of Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple) and learned Ho (dharma, which has various meanings such as order, rule, law and custom) from Engyo.

Bearing a grudge because of this, he killed himself by fasting to death, and it was widely believed that he became a rancorous ghost taking the shape of an iron rat (a huge rat as large as a bull with a stone body and iron teeth), and bit and tore the Buddhist scriptures belonging to Enryaku-ji Temple, as well as causing the death of the four-year-old Imperial Prince Atsufumi.

"Hannyashin-gyo Hiken" was a commentary on "Hannya Shingyo" (the Wisdom Sutras) and was written by Kukai around 818.
Some schools of the Shingon sect sometimes read "Hannyashin-gyo Hiken" as makura-gyo Death Guidance (pillow sutra).
It points out the similarities and differences between Kumaraju's translation of "Hannya Shingyo" and Daihenkaku Sanjo's (Xuan Zang) translation and it also defines "Hannya Shingyo" as a teaching to dive into deep meditation with the help of Daishin Shingon mantra of Hannya-bosatsu.
It preaches that "Hannya Shingyo" should not be mixed with "Daihannyaharamitta-kyo Sutra," because they contain the same phrases, just as dragons shouldn't be considered the same as snakes because both have the same scales.
It criticizes the perspective of considering "Hannya Shingyo" to be the summary of 600 volumes of "Dai Hannya Shingyo."
It also pays attention to Shingon granted to the last part and recommends that you should not read "Hannya Shingyo" but make it the object for kansho (meditation based on Shingon nenju) and practice it.

He was born in Kyoto on February 16, 1271.
His child name was 'Kosen.'
He lost his mother in 1272.
He was then five years old in 1274.
Around that time, he started to aspire to enter into priesthood.
In 1277, he studied holy writings, both home and foreign, under Jishinbo Chokai, who resided at a neighboring temple, and was instructed 'Shoshin-shu' of Tendai Sect.
In 1282 (or 1284), he became a disciple of Saisho Hoin Shuto, a monk of Enryaku-ji Temple.
He learned the doctrine of Tendai Sect.
In 1283, he became a disciple of Shinsho, a monk of Kofuku-ji Temple Ichijo-in, and learned the doctrine of Hosso Sect.
After the death of Shinsho, he further studied under Kakusho, a disciple of Shinsho.
During that time, he studied San-lun Teachings under Jishobo Ryonen who was engaged in syncretic study of all eight Buddhism teachings.
In 1286, he entered the Buddhist priesthood and received Buddhist precepts at Kofuku-ji Temple Ichijo-in in Nara and thereafter, he was called 'Kakunyobo Soshu' and he further studied under Gyokaku.
In 1287, he learned Shugi (the teachings of Honen and Shinran) from Nyoshin (Shinran's grandchild) who came to Kyoto for attending Shinran's Shogetsuki (anniversary of the month of one's death).
(since then, he learned Shugi whenever Nyoshin came to Kyoto.)
In 1288, he learned Shugi from Yuien when Yuien came to Kyoto.
On June 4, 1290 (old lunar calendar), Zonkaku (Sonkaku), his eldest son, was born.
Since this year, he visited Shinran's remains in Togoku (Kanto region) along with his father Kakue and Joga Hogen and was taught by Shinran's disciples.
In 1294, he wrote "Hoon-ko Shiki" (Hoon-ko Shiki, Shikimon) on the occasion of the 32nd anniversary of Shinran's death (the origin of Hoon-ko).
Since around that time, he became conscious that he was the successor of Shinran.
In 1295, he wrote "Hongan-ji Shonin Dene" (first version 'Jusandan' (13 chapters)).
He got Joga Hogen to draw pictures.
(the initial one was a picture scroll)
In 1299, Kakue became sick.
In 1301, he wrote "Shui-Kotoku Den," in which he emphasized that Shinran was the successor of Honen.
In 1302, a conflict erupted between Kakue and Yuizen concerning the position of Rusushiki (the custodian of Shinran's Mausoleum at Otani) (Yuizen Incident).
In 1306, Yuizen robbed Kakue of the key of Otani Byodo Mausoleum and occupied it.
Kakunyo and Kakue evacuated to the house of Kakunyo's wife's parents located at Sanjo Suzaku.
In 1307, Kakue died at Sanjo Suzaku.
In July, 1309, it was decided by Shoren-in Temple that Rusushiki of Otani Byodo Mausoleum should be succeeded by Kakunyo.
Yuizen, who was defeated, destroyed Otani Byodo Mausoleum thoroughly, took Mieizo (wooden statue of Shinran) as well as a portion of Shinran's remains and ran away to Kamakura.
(Yuizen Incident was concluded.)
However, Togoku Monto (believers in Kanto region) didn't unconditionally admit Kakunyo as the successor because they didn't like that the successor of Rusushiki of Otani Byodo Mausoleum was limited to a person who was related by birth.
In the face of such a situation, he was forced to write a petition consisting of 12 clauses (as of July 26 in the same year) on the premise of his inauguration as Rusushiki.
Triggered by the above incident, he realized the limitation in the weak position of Rusushiki and started to think of the conversion of 'Otani Byodo Mausoleum' into a temple.
In 1310, he went to the Kanto region for the purpose of soliciting contributions and petitioning believers for approving his inauguration as Rusushiki.
After a half year of petitioning, his inauguration was approved and he formally succeeded the position of Rusushiki.
In 1311, he reconstructed Mieizo and Ei-do Hall (a hall dedicated to sect's founder) on the occasion of the 49th anniversary of Shinran's death.
In 1314, he handed over the position of Rusushiki to Zonkaku, his eldest son, and entered into a secluded life at Ichijo Omiya due to his own illness as well as with the aim of making the succession of Rusushiki by a bloodline a fait accompli.
In 1321, he converted 'Otani Byodo Mausoleum' into a temple and named it 'Hongan-ji Temple' (the establishment of Hongan-ji Temple).
In the wake of conversion to a temple, Bettoshoku (a chief administrator of a temple) was created by combining the role of Rusushiki and Jujishoku (a resident head of a temple).
In 1322, he severed his relations with Zonkaku and was reinstated in Bettoshoku because of a conflict of opinion concerning the succession of Rusushiki by a bloodline and the attitude toward Togoku Monto.
In 1326, he wrote "Shuji Sho."
In 1331, he wrote "Kuden Sho" in which he declared 'a bloodline of three generations' and insisted his succession of Hoto (the light of Buddhism).
(Religious line: Honen=>Shinran=>Nyoshin=>Kakunyo, bloodline: Shinran=>Kakushinni=>Kakue=>Kakunyo) He defined himself as the third head priest of Hongan-ji Temple.
(Shinran: the founder of Hongan-ji Temple <the founder of the sect>, Nyoshin: the second head priest of Hongan-ji Temple)
In 1332, he went to Oami (Furudono-machi, Shirakawa-gun, Fukushima Prefecture) in Mutsu Province in order to preach at the memorial service for the 32nd anniversary of Nyoshin's death.
Taking this opportunity, he convinced 20-odd Togoku Monto to admit that he was the legitimate inheritor of sect's doctrine as well as the successor of Hoto and got them to sign their names.
In 1336, he evacuated to Omi Uriuzu, where Zonkaku resided, in order to keep away from the war initiated by Takauji ASHIKAGA.
Hongan-ji Temple was burnt down by the fires of war.
"Hongan-ji Shonin Dene" (first version) was lost.
In 1337, he returned to Kyoto and resided at Nishiyama Kuon-ji Temple.
He wrote "Hongan Sho" and "Gaija Sho."
In 1338, he absolved Zonkaku of gizetsu and handed over Bettoshoku to him through the mediation of Gutotsu of Omi Uriuzu.
In 1340, he wrote "Gangan Sho."
In 1342, he again severed his relations with Zonkaku and was reinstated in Bettoshoku.
In 1343, he wrote "Saiyo Sho."
He supplemented "Hongan-ji Shonin Dene" ("Godensho") and made it a book consisting of 15 chapters (Koeibon (a book written in Koei era)).
He got Enjuku (a son of Joga Hogen) and his disciple Soshun to draw "Goeden."
(For worshippers' convenience sake, words and pictures were separately compiled in "Godensho" and "Goeden" respectively.)
In 1350, he absolved Zonkaku of gizetsu.
(He once had refused.)
He wrote a letter stating that he would get Zennyo, a son of his second son Jukaku, to succeed Bettoshoku.

Oeshiki means Daihoe (great Buddhist memorial service) (a festival) that is held on the anniversary of sects' founders etc.
It is kigo (seasonal words) for autumn in haiku (Japanese seventeen-syllable poet) since Oeshiki of Nichiren Sect is held in autumn as explained below.
Oeshiki of Nichiren Sect
Oeshiki is a Buddhist memorial service that is held on the anniversary of Nichiren (October 13) in various schools of Nichiren Sect.
Oeshiki held at Ikegami Honmon-ji Temple, located in Ota Ward, Tokyo, is especially famous as a festival and hundreds of thousands of people visit it.
Though its origin is not clear, it is contemplated that Oeshiki was held as early as in the Edo period because it appears in "Meisho Edo Hyakkei" (a hundred scenery spots in Edo) painted by Hiroshige UTAMARO, an Ukiyoe artist.
On the eve of Nichiren's anniversary (October 12) called Otaiya, groups of believers (kochu) gathered from around the nation parade inside the precincts hoisting mando candles (candles for Buddhist service) and chochin (a lantern), waving matoi (firemen's flag), beating uchiwa-daiko (a round fan drum) and shoko drums and chanting daimoku (Nichiren chant).
Originally, it was a simple event in which participants worshipped hoisting chochin with a candle lighted and beating uchiwa-daiko.
Waving matoi became common when Machihikeshi (civil firemen) in the Meiji period participated along with people of kochu.
In recent years, light bulbs, fluorescent lamps and/or light -emitting diodes that are connected to a generator are used for mando in lieu of candles.
As Kishimojin (a goddess of childbirth and children) is often enshrined at temples of Nichiren Sect, Oeshiki is often held as the one that is combined with the festival of Kishimojin.
Depending on temples, chigogyoretsu (kids parade) sometimes appears in Oeshiki or Senbue (another important event), instead of Hanamatsuri (Buddhist festival celebrating Buddha's birthday).
October 13 above is based on the lunar calendar and it coincides with November 21 on the solar calendar.
Oeshiki of Jodo-Sect
In Jodo-Sect, the memorial Buddhist service for Honen's parents, its biggest Buddhist Memorial service, is called Oeshiki.
In Jodo-sect, another important event called Ojuya is held around the same time with Oeshiki of Nichiren Sect.
Oeshiki of Shotoku Sect
At Horyu-ji Temple (Ikaruga-cho, the head temple of Shotoku Sect), 'Oeshiki' is held from March 22 -24, which coincides with shotsuki-meinichi (the anniversaries of one's death after the first anniversary) of the virtual sect founder Prince Shotoku (on lunar calendar basis).
Especially, Daihoyo (Daieshiki) held once ten years is called 'Shoryoe' and on that occasion, bugaku (music accompanying traditional Japanese court dances) in which players dance along to gagaku (ceremonial court music) performed by Sanpo gakusho (organization of transmission of gagaku) is dedicated.
Other than the above, similar events are held in Kegon Sect, Shingon Sect and at some shrines.

As he became famous for his painting, he received constant requests for drawing, and since he furthermore attempted to make excessive profits over accumulated enormous wealth, there were a lot of people who were criticizing him for that.

He was the eighth son of the Buddhist priest Rennyo of the eighth abbot of Hongan-ji Temple.
His imina (personal name) was Mitsukane.
He became the ninth abbot of Hongan-ji Temple.
In 1467 his father Rennyo was declared 'an enemy of Buddhism' by Enryaku-ji Temple and driven away from Kyoto; during the period Rennyo was depressed by Enryaku-ji Temple's persecution, he was forced to live in retirement, to disinherit his eldest sun Junnyo, and to transfer the family headship to Jitsunyo, who at that time was known as Mitsutanemaru (光養丸), but Rennyo regained his influence following the resurgence in Hongan-ji Temple's own power, which left the inheritance question up in the air, until eventually things went back to the way they had been, with Junnyo reinstalled as his successor.
But in 1483, with the death of his eldest brother Junnyo, Jitsunyo was once again made successor (and for that reason, there are actually two letters of inheritance, used by his father the chief priest to name his successor, in existence that designate Jitsunyo his heir), and in 1489, he succeeded his father Rennyo and became the ninth abbot of Hongan-ji Temple.
And even after Rennyo passed away in 1499, Jitsunyo found it necessary to handle the maintenance of a religious organization that had suddenly expanded a great deal in scale during his father's time.
Jitsunyo placed particular importance on his relationship with the Kanrei (shogunal deputy) Masamoto HOSOKAWA.
Formerly, after forces of the Kaga Ikko Ikki (a popular revolt by the Ikko sect) attacked and destroyed the Shugo (provincial constable) Masachika TOGASHI, just as the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA was preparing to issue an order to destroy Hongan-ji Temple, Masamoto came out strongly against issuing such an order and managed to have the order repealed, and because of this chain of events, Jitsunyo felt a major debt of gratitude towards Masamoto.
As a result, in 1495 Jitsunyo gave his approval to purge Senji KAWAI, leader of the Kaga Ikki (revolt) and member of the anti-Masamoto faction, from the religious establishment.
But in 1506, when Jitsunyo agreed to Masamoto HOSOKAWA's request to cooperate in the subjugation of Yoshihide HATAKEYAMA, Jodo Shinshu followers from Settsu and Kawachi Provinces, who had strong ties to the Hatakeyama clan, furiously opposed him, and consequently Jitsunyo's younger brother by a different mother, Jitsugen, himself descended from the Hatakeyama clan, demanded, with the backing of Ishiyama Gobo (later became Omi Province's Shotoku-ji Temple), that he replaced Jitsunyo as Hoshu (high priest) of the Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Jitsunyo, invigorated by this challenge to his authority, managed to outmaneuver his opponents and retain power (in what was called the 'Osaka War'), but following this, when Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA had Masamoto assassinated and began fighting with Sumimoto HOSOKAWA, Jitsunyo, who was caught in the middle of this conflict, was eventually banished temporarily to Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple by Sumimoto.
Jitsunyo, racking his mind for what to do amongst these circumstances, planned several responses, notably: 1) promulgating--together with his younger brother Renjun and his son Ennyo--three different punitive admonitions, the most notable of which was the one focused on Jodo Shinshu followers in the Hokuriku region (central-north Japan) that outlawed Ikki; 2) establishing Ichimon-Ikka System that split the household at Hongan-ji Temple into the Ichimonshu (the lineage of the eldest son) and the Ikkashu (the lineage of the second and other sons); and 3) selecting 80 documents from among Rennyo's writings, compiling them into five volumes, calling them the Gobun (also referred as Ofumi, literally Epistles) and using them as the fundamental doctrinal creed of the sect.
Shippan (unknown – October 15, 1144) was a monk during the late Heian period.
His father was Sangi (councilor) FUJIWARA no Akizane.
His azana (adult males nickname) was Hongon.
He was also called Renko Shosho Shonin, Nakagawa Chujo Shonin, and Nakagawa Risshi.

Amida (Amitabha) worship is the religious belief based on the Pure Land of Buddhism which believes in justification by belief and preaches that praying to Amida Nyorai would lead you to heaven.
It is one of the Jodo Buddhist teachings, but it is a comprehensive belief that transcends sects and could be considered as a folk religion.
"Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra" (Sutra of Immeasurable Life) teaches that Amitabha Nyorai received the teachings of 'Sejizaio-nyorai' when he was a Hozo bosatsu (Dharmakara Bodhisattva) and thought and promised the 48 vows for almost as long as eternity, later underwent more training to fulfill the promise and became a Buddha.
Amitabha Nyorai is revered in many Buddhist sects and Amida worship is a wide encompassing belief that is not restricted to one Buddhist writing, but does have an aspect that could easily fall into idol worship or a single-god (only Amida Nyorai is revered) type of thinking.
Amida worship was first introduced into Japan during the Nara period and mixed together with Miroku Bosatsu (Buddha of the Future, Bodhisattva of the Present) belief as ancestral worship.
Later, as part of the flow of Mappo-shiso (the "end of the world" belief), it transitioned into Nenbutsu belief as Amida Jodo Shinko (Amida Buddha in the Pure Land worship) in which people wished to be saved and enter heaven by believing in Amitabha Nyorai
Various beliefs sprung from Jodo (Pure Land) sect to Kamakura New Buddhism, such as Yuzu Nenbutsu (reciting the name of Amitabha) by Ryonin in the late Heian period, Jodo Sect by Honen, Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) by Shinran, and Ji Sect by Ippen.
Original Form
The foundation is thought to have started in India around the second century.
The first example of Amida worship that is traceable to modern times was when the Jodo Sect was established in China, which teaches Shomyo Nenbutsu (Invocation of the Buddha's Name) as easy progress associated with Bosatsu belief of Mahayana Buddhism.
The teachings of the ten positions of Bosatsu (the ten positions that are required as training for a Bosatsu to attain enlightenment) led to a easy progress of the 'Shomyo Nenbutsu.'
The believers of conventional Mahayana Buddhism criticized these teachings, but the Jodo Sect rallied by forming Nenbutsu Kessha (groups for invocation of Buddha's name).
The origins of Japanese Amitabha Jodo worship started when the last Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China, Ennin (794 – 864) of the Tendai Sect came back from Tang and brought Hosho school Nenbutsu of his training place, Mt. Wutai Shan, to Enryaku-ji Temple and built the Jogyo Zanmai-do Hall.
The training here consists of chanting Shomyo Nenbutsu for 90 days without rest and thinking and praying about Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) deep in the soul.
Thinking about the Amida Nyorai' was 'Kanso Nenbutsu,' the tangible meditative training to reach enlightenment, and was first accepted by the lower class aristocracy.
At that time, the majority of important positions in aristocratic society were taken by the Fujiwara clan, hence members of other clans had to wait quietly for their slight chance of getting promoted.
This way of living was said to match the feeling of Kanso Nenbutsu where one thinks and adores the image of Buddha.
YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane, a literati of that time who was also a middle class aristocrat, started the Nenbutsu kessha 'Kangakukai' and started to practice Jodo Sect religion.
YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane collected biographies of people who attained gokuraku ojo (peaceful death) by Amida worship and wrote the "Nihon ojo gokurakuki" (Japanese records of birth into the Pure Land).
Later, other books were written following the editing method of "Nihon ojo gokurakuki" such as "Zoku honcho ojoden" (Sequel to the Accounts of Rebirth into the Pure Land) (written by OE no Masafusa), "Shui Ojo-den" (written by MIYOSHI no Tameyasu) and "Sange Ojo-den" (written by Sami Rensho (沙弥蓮祥)).
Using specific actual examples to teach death was extremely effective in spreading the Jodo sect.
As the Jodo sect spread amongst the middle and lower class aristocracy, the Fujiwara clan who were the upper class aristocracy were affected and started to believe in the Jodo sect to take the glory of this life to the next life.
Temples during the Heian period were under the control of the government and (public) monks were basically public servants.
Public monks were restricted by many regulations and had to focus on work for the country.
In such a situation, some public monks quit their jobs because they could not save the ordinary public and started activity as individuals.
Such monks were called 'illegally ordained priests' or 'Tonse-so' and one of them was Kuya (903 - 972) who was later called 'Ichi-no-hijiri.'
Kuya walked around the various provinces and actively spread his teachings among the public and listened to the public's wants and worries.
He also worked for public works and worked relentlessly for the spread of Amida worship and Nenbutsu.
Kuya also established Odori Nenbutsu (dancing and invocations of Buddha's name).
"Ojoyoshu" (The Essentials of Salvation), written in 985 by Genshin (942 - 1017), a disciple of Ryogen (912 – 985) apprentice had an important part in the further development of the Jodo sect.
"Ojoyoshu" preached rules for seeing Amida Nyorai and specific methods for entering Jodo upon death, and was extremely easy to understand and practical and was considered the basis of nenbutsu thinking that was widely read by the ordinary public as well.
The year after he published the book, he made a group, 'Nijugozanmaie' on Mt. Hiei, and here Genshin fulfilled a leadership role and conducted nenbutsu-zanmai (mental absorption in the nenbutsu) once a month.
The people who gathered exchanged promises amongst themselves to help each other face death by wishing for raigo (descent of Amida).
Genshin was a monk of the Tendai Sect, but left Enryaku-ji Temple, which was becoming secularized and conducted his own training.
This is how Japanese Buddhism changed from the old regime Buddhism as a way of controlling the country to Buddhism for saving the masses.
Mappo-shiso was a end-of-the-world theory that originated in China and considered the thousand years after Shaka's death as Shobo, Age of the Right Dharma, the next thousand years as Zobo (Age of the Semblance Dharma) and the next 10,000 years after the two thousand years as 'the latter days of Buddhism' (Mappo).
During those days, the power of Buddha was not effective and the world was thought to end and both the aristocracy and ordinary people were worried about its coming.
In addition, Mappo negated the possibility of being saved in this life and the trend for wishing for attainment of heaven or Jodo upon death was growing and this led to the growth of the Jodo belief which worshipped the Amida Nyorai as its saviour.
According to "Mappotomyoki" (Lamp for the Last Dharma-Age) attributed to Saicho (767 – 822), the first year of Mappo is 1052 in the late Heian period, when kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) FUJIWARA no Yorimichi built the Amitabha-do (hoo-do) in Byodoin Temple at Uji, Kyoto which could be considered as an iconic symbol of Amida worship.
The Amitabha-do expresses the sublime and fancy Gokuraku Jodo written in "Bussetsu Kan Muryoju-kyo Sutra" and "Bussetsu Amida-kyo Sutra" of the 'Jodo Sanbu-kyo' (the three main sutras of the Jodo (Pure Land) Sect) and the exterior is said to emulate the heavenly palace of Amida Nyorai.
If you can't believe in heaven, go and see the hall at Uji' was a line of a song of that time.
At that time, the Amida worship had deeply spread within the aristocracy and Amida Nyorai statues with Jo-in (samadhi mudra, gesture of meditation) and the building of Amida Buddha halls were popular.
Amida Buddha halls led to the birth of Amida Raigo-zu (image of the descent of Amida Buddha).
Many halls other than the Byodoin Hoo-do Hall are known, such as; the Konjiki-do Hall at Chuson-ji Temple, the Amida-do Hall at Hokai-ji Temple, and the Shiramizu Amida-do Hall.
Kamakura Period.
This was the beginning of the age when the government changed from the aristocrats to the warrior class and was the time when Buddhism was at its height in Japanese history.
There was drastic change and development in politics, economics and society.
Together with such changes during the new period, Buddhism also experienced significant growth.
Jodo Sect
The founder was Honen (1133 - 1212) who entered Mt. Hiei in 1145.
In 1175, he converted and followed 'Senju Nenbutsu' (the Single-Minded Recitation of the Nenbutsu) after studying Kanmuryoju-kyosho (Commentary on the Meditation Sutra) by Zendo (Chinese Jodo Sect) and established the Jodo Sect.
Senju Nenbutsu was proposed by Honen only recognized Shomyo Nenbutsu and negated Kanso Nenbutsu, which was considered as a way of Jodo Ojo (Rebirth in the Pure Land).
He taught that by repeating 'Namu Amidabutsu' many times, all people regardless of whether they are rich or poor, male or female could attain Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (The West Pure Land (of Amida Buddha)) upon death and this was decided upon at the time of death.
He finished writing "Senchaku hongan nenbutsu shu (the holy writings of the Jodo Sect)" in 1198.
Jodo Shinshu Sect
The founder Shinran (1173 – 1262) entered Mt. Hiei in 1181, and became Honen's apprentice in 1201.
Later he spent 20 years in Kanto region to spread the teachings of Nenbutsu.
He taught that with proper religious belief, it is possible for any person so reach the position of those guaranteed to Jodo Ojo while still in this world.
He proposed 'Ocho Dan Shiru' in his main writing "Ken Jodo Shinjitsu-kyo Gyosho Monrui (Selected passages revealing the true teaching, practice and attainment of the Pure Land), which he finished writing in 1274.
Ocho' means passing is determined instantaneously and 'shiryu' (four elements) is 'life,' 'disease,' 'ageing' and 'death' and he taught that by cutting away from these four elements, one could rebirth in the Pure Land.
After being stripped of his privileges as a monk when he was exiled, following Honen's advice, he stayed as hiso hizoku (neither monk nor lay) until his death (since he was no longer a monk, he did not place importance on the religious precept and ate meat and married).
Jodo Shinshu Sect became a religious group after his death.
Ji Sect
The founder, Ippen (1239 – 1289) traveled to Dazaifu in 1251 and became a disciple of Honen's apprentice's apprentice, Shotatsu (1203 – 1279) of the Jodo Sect.
Later he traveled through various provinces and received a revelation from Kumano Gongen at Kumano Hongu-taisha Shrine in Kii and is said to have found Ji Sect.
This revelation was that the people have already been saved a long time ago by pledge of Hozobiku (Dharmakara) so he went around to tell the people that they have already been saved by giving out tablets that have the inscription 'Namu Amidabutsu' (which referred as Fusan).
The absoluteness of the Amida Buddha did not even require 'believing' and only chanting the nenbutsu was sufficient to rebirth in the Pure Land.
He started Odori Nenbutsu in his later years.
The Ikko Sect was the common name of the Hongan-ji Temple group of the Jodo Shinshu Sect and was started by Kakunyo (1270 - 1351), the grandchild of Shinran's daughter Kakushinni, and resurrected by the eighth chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple, Rennyo (1415 – 1499).
The followers were called monto and were a strong group of believers during the Muromachi period following the Amida and Nenbutsu beliefs.
Ikko' is also read as 'hitasura' (entirely) and means to 'believe in a being saved entirely by the Amida Buddha.'
Because they keep on chanting 'Namu Amidabutsu,' they are often considered as part of the Senju Nenbutsu group, but in reality, other thinking such as Shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) and Esoteric Buddhism were incorporated and some monto believed in local beliefs such as jujutsu (an occult art) and incantations, so it cannot be considered as Senshu (Single-Minded).
Ordinary people believing in the Ikko Sect are thought to have wished for the power held by Amida Nyorai and Nenbutsu rather than the religious thinking of Senju Nenbutsu.
The solidarity of the Ikko Sect believers was very strong and the power of conventional shugo daimyo (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) was significantly eroded.
Ikko Ikki (revolts by Ikko Sect believers) such as the Kaga ikko ikki and ikki (revolts) in Yamashiro Province are famous.
Therefore many shugo daimyo sought to compromise and find a way to live together, but Nobunaga ODA tried to completely suppress the group.
Nobunaga destroyed Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple and the Hongan-ji religious group declined and broke into pieces.
Please note the Jodo Shinshu Sect and Ikko Sect are not exactly the same.
For example, Rennyo prohibited monto from using the name 'Ikko Sect,' but opposite to what Hongan-ji Temple wanted, in actuality, Ikko believers were deeply related with the Hongan-ji religious group.

At the time, Buddhism was criticized by Confucian scholars and scholars of Japanese classical literature, and Entsu thought that the decline of Buddhism was caused by the development of astro-geography, and thus he mastered the study of the calendar of India.
As a result, in 1810 he wrote 5 volumes of "Bukkoku Rekishohen" (literally, "study of the calendar in India") based on the astronomy of Mt. Sumeru (in Buddhism - said to be the highest mountain rising in the center of the world).
Tadataka INO offered a counterargument to him in "Bukkoku Rekishohen Sekimo" (literally, "to eliminate the wrong idea of Bukkoku Rekishohen") and Shingen TAKEDA in Osaka engaged in a battle of words with Entsu, who was visiting Osaka, and argued Entsu down.

Kechimyaku-sojo (also referred as kechimyaku-sosho) or blood inheritance is a metaphor that is used to describe the inheritance of teachings (Buddhism) from a mentor to a pupil, taking the blood flow as an analogy.
The teachings in kechimyaku-sojo consist of the principal object of worship, doctrine, religious precepts, documents describing the esoteric techniques and secrets, and treasures, which are all given from a mentor and, therefore, are 'the things that need to be inherited by a person who will become a mentor in the next generation.'
Generally, everything is transmitted behind closed doors.
Its meaning can vary from when it is looked at as a mere inheritance, to when it is looked at as secrets being handed down from father to son.
It is called Dento-sosho (the light inheritance) in the Jodo Shinshu.
In the Hongan-ji School and Otani School of the Jodo Shinshu, the word particularly refers to the hand-over of the position of the chief of the school to a descendant of Shinran.
In the Shingon Sect, all orthodoxies of Esoteric Buddhism were handed down to Kukai when he received denpo-kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma) from Keika.
It is called Hoshi in the Zen Sect, in which they claim that it was Daruma who was the twenty-eighth founder of fuhozo (those who, after Shakyamuni Buddha's death, successively inherited the lineage of his teachings and propagated them in India) that succeeded the Kyogai betsuden teaching (transmission of spiritual awakening without words or characters, but in a heart-to-heart way) from Shakamuni to Makakasho, through intuitive discernment from generation to generation.
It can be proven by the receipt of the robes and bowls of the predecessors up to Eno, the sixth founder of the Zen Sect.
Please refer to the article of Kechimyaku-sojo (Nichiren Sho Sect) for Kechimyaku-sojo in the Nichiren Sho Sect.
There are sects that do not use the term Kechimyaku-sojo or do not have a concept similar to Kechimyaku-sojo.
Zenko-ji Temple in Nagano Prefecture regards the kechimyaku as a certification to be reborn in heaven.
Anyone who pays a fee at the place to provide the kechimyaku can be given 'the kechimyaku stamp ensuring the road to heaven' on its forehead.
It seems that this ritual had already became popular in the Edo period, and was used as material for rakugo (a traditional comic monologue), titled "Okechimyaku."

But Ieyasu TOKUGAWA claimed that his poem included an ill-omened expression for him, and demanded that the Buddhist ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple be cancelled (this is so-called Hoko-ji Temple Bell Incident).

After returning to Japan, he successively played the role of chief priest of Manju-ji Temple in Bungo Province and Kichijo-ji Temple in Kozuke Province.
Following this he was able to convert Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, the third Shogun, and was invited to Kamakura Engaku-ji Temple and Kencho-ji Temple, but he firmly declined these invitations and instead resided at Ryogon-ji Temple in Kasama district, Hitachi Province.
Gensho (1146 - 1204?) was a priest of the Shingon sect of the end of the Heian period to the early Kamakura period.
His posthumous name was Genkan-bo.
Although the year of his death was said to be 1204, it seems that he lived up to around 1206.
He learnt Shingon Esoteric Buddhism from fuhodeshi (literally, mastered disciples), Daijobosshoin of Kakuban and Hanka of Daigo-ji Temple.
He resided at Getsujo-in Temple on Mt. Koya.

Nissho (1829 - 1908) was a priest of the Nichiren sect (Fujufuse school) of the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period.
His posthumous name was Senmyo-in.
As Fujufuse school was banned under the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the believers of this school belonged to the Nichiren sect Ju school or other sect's temples for the public (Naishin or Naishinja (inwardly-having faith)), Nissho tried to unify the school and successfully gained an official approval of the fujufuse school with an official notice of Kyobusho (the Ministry of Religion) in 1878.
He obtained the residence of a doctor, Hosetsu NANBA of Aki Province (today's Okayama Prefecture) in the end of Edo period, converted it and built Myokaku-ji Temple (Okayama City), and made it the head temple.
Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben (September 16, 1669 - June 6, 1716) was a Buddhist monk of the Tendai Sect in the Edo period.
He was Imperial Prince Takanomiya Hidenori, the sixth son and of the Emperor Gosai.
After becoming a monk, his title became Cloistered Imperial Prince by Imperial proclamation.
In addition to becoming Monzeki (head priest of a temple who is a member of the Imperial Family) of Bishamon-do Temple, he successively served as the head priest of Mt. Nikko (Nikko Toshogu Shrine, Rinno-ji Temple) and Mt. Toei (Kanei-ji Temple).
His court rank was Ippon (first rank of Imperial prince) Jusangu (the honorable rank after the three empresses).
His go (pen names) were Shurei and Gendo.
After he retired he called himself Daimyoin.
He learned calligraphy from Tsunenobu KANO and was known as a distinguished calligrapher.
He was born in 1669 as the sixth son of Emperor Gosai.
His mother was Rokujo no Tsubone (a daughter of Chishu, a monk of the Tendai Sect).
She was also an adopted daughter of Dainagon (chief councilor) Sadanori ROKUJO.
In 1674, he became a disciple of Kokai (monk), the head priest of Izumo-ji Temple on Mt. Goho (Monzeki of Bishamon-do Temple) and vowed to follow the religious precepts.
In 1678, he entered into the priesthood seven days after he was given the title of Imperial Prince by Imperial proclamation and his title became Cloistered Imperial Prince.
In 1682, he was conferred the court rank of Nihon (the second court rank for an Imperial Prince).
In 1690, he was appointed as the Monzeki of Rinno-ji Temple and went to the Kanto region.
In 1692, he became Isshin-ajari (a special class of teaching priest) and received Kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) at Mt. Toei.
In 1693, the court rank of Ippon was conferred upon him.
He was appointed as Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect).
He was permitted to use gissha (an ox-drawn carriage) when entering the Imperial Palace.
In 1707, he became Jusangu.
In 1715, he resigned from all positions and entered into a secluded life at Bishamon-do Temple.
In 1716, he passed away.
He was buried at Bishamon-do Temple.
He strived to systemize the doctrine of the Tendai Sect, compile a book of discussion and construct a learning dormitory.
The "Daishu Nihaku-dai" (two hundred problems of Tendai), which was compiled at the order of Koben, is still used today, and is seen as a precious and fundamental piece of religious literature.
He suppressed the Tachikawa School of the Shingon Sect on the grounds that it was a false creed.
In order to make Mt. Nikko prosperous, he encouraged the development of industry in nearby villages.
During 1688 and 1704, he constructed Oshitsuen (御漆園, a lacquer tree field) at Mt. Nikko for the purpose of industrial development and promoted the planting of lacquer trees.
Thanks to his efforts, lacquer ware production techniques, such as Nikko carving, Momiji-nuri (lacquer ware with maple leaf patterns) and Nikko Shunkei-nuri (Shunkei-nuri (a technique of applying transparent urushi lacquer over wood grain so the natural wood pattern shows through and was reportedly invented by a 14c lacquer master named Shunkei) ware produced in Nikko), were established and lacquer ware production was commercialized.
In 1698, he constructed a Buddha hall for the great Buddha Statue of Ueno which had been stood without a roof.
In the same year, he brought the method of ascetic practice in the Tachikawa School of the Shingon Sect to light, and ordered it to burn and destroy ritual instruments.
In response to a petition submitted by Ryoo DOKAKU, in 1703 he reconstructed kangakuryo (learning dormitory) on Mt. Toei, which had been destroyed by fire, as a Kangakukoin (a learning school) operated by bakufu (the Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
In 1711, he selected the Nikko Hakkei (eight most scenic spots in Nikko).
In 1714, he ordered Chishu of Gano-in Temple to compile a book of discussion and published "Daishu Nihaku-dai."
According to "Tokugawa Jikki" (The official records of the Edo bakufu), Koben urged Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA, then shogun, to order the Ako Roshi (lordless samurai of Ako clan) to commit seppuku (suicide by disembowelment) when the Genroku Ako Incident occurred in 1703.
As Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben was close to Tsunayoshi because his maternal aunt was a lady-in-waiting of Nobuko TAKATSUKASA, Tsunayoshi's legal wife, Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben was in a position to be consulted by Tsunayoshi even though he was far younger than Tsunayoshi.
After the Incident, Tsunayoshi was worried about the punishment to be imposed on the Ako Roshi because there was a conflict of opinion among the officials in the bakufu.
When Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben paid a New Year's visit to Tsunayoshi on March 17, 1703, Tsunayoshi mentioned, while chatting, that he was worried about the punishment against the Ako Roshi.
Though Tsunayoshi had already decided to order seppuku, he couldn't stop feeling that he wanted to save the lives of the Roshi.
However, pardoning them would mean admitting his decision, in ordering only Takuminokami ASANO to commit seppuku, was unfair and if he did so in his position as shogun it could damage his authority.
Under such circumstances, it seems that Tsunayoshi expected Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben to appeal for mercy and wanted to use such appeal as the reason for pardoning them.
In that event, Tsunayoshi would be able to save the lives of the Roshi under the pretext of the Imperial family's request, without damaging his authority as shogun.
Though he was sympathetic to the Roshi's raid and had composed on February 20 of the same year a waka poem which praised the Roshi, at the time Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben gave non-committal responses to Tsunayoshi's remarks, and the issue was not directly addressed.
On March 20, Tsunayoshi inevitably informed the domains to which the Roshi were put of his decision and the Roshi committed seppuku on the same day.
When asked the reason why he didn't appeal for mercy, Cloistered Imperial Prince Koben said 'Since they achieved their aim, it is better for them to bequeath the lesson of their honor by committing seppuku rather than to live on polluted by the dirt of vulgarity.'
According to "Horibe Kanamaru Oboe-gaki" (a notebook of Kanamaru HORIBE), Yahe HORIBE (which Kanamaru HORIBE commonly called) tried, after the incident, to appeal to the bakufu through Rinnojinomiya (Koben) for the purpose of restoring their reputation.
On these grounds some people assert that Rinno-ji Temple tried to avoid becoming involved in the conflict between the officials of the bakufu.
When he was the chief priest of Kanei-ji Temple, he deplored that bush warblers in Ueno forest started to sing belatedly and their notes were not sweet.
He then instructed Kenzan OGATA to send for 3,500 "early singing bush warblers" with sweet notes from Kyoto and let them free in Negishi no Sato Town.
Thanks to this, bush warblers' notes in Negishi became sweeter and the area became a famous place called "Hatsune no Sato," a place where bush warblers start to sing first in Edo.
The name of the place called Uguisudani (warblers' village) derives from the above episode.
As the land owned by Jindai-ji Temple, a branch temple of Kanei-ji Temple, was not suitable for rice farming because it was so infertile, kosakunin (tenant farmers) used to cultivate buckwheat and deliver it to the temple.
When soba (buckwheat noodles) was served on the occasion of his visit to Jindai-ji Temple, Koben was pleased with it very much and thereafter he often took up soba as a topic of conversation in the shogun's residence.
As a result, Jindai-ji soba became very famous and it became well-known across the nation as 'soba suitable as a present' because a lot of domains and families sent for Jindai-ji soba.
Around Negishi area, there are several long-established products, such as 'Sasanoyuki no tofu' (soybean curd of Sasanoyuki Tofu restaurant) and 'Chikuryuan no kogome daifuku' (Chikuryuan's soft rice cake including crashed rice stuffed with sweetened bean jam) which had associations with Koben.
Kokai (January 29, 1608 – November 22, 1695) was a Buddhist priest of the Tendai Sect in the early part of the Edo period.
His father was Tadanaga KAZANIN.
Subsequent to the passing of his teacher Tenkai, Kokai succeeded him as the chief priest of Mt. Nikko.
In 1620, Kokai became a pupil of Tenkai Sojo (a high-ranking Buddhist priest) who was referred to as Kokui no Saisho (a priest who has influence in politics).
Upon the passing of Tenkai in 1643, Kokai, residing at Kanei-ji Temple on Mt. Toei, carried on Tenkai's dharma and by placing under his control Mt. Hiei the Grand Head Temple of the Tendai Sect as well as Mt. Nikko where the Nikko Toshogu Shrine dedicated to Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was located, took the helm of the entire Tendai Sect.
In 1647, Kokai was appointed as Sojo and in 1648, the following year, assumed the position of daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order).
Later on, Kokai turned the position of administrator of the three major shrines and temples over to Cloistered Imperial Prince Shucho.
Carrying out the wishes of Tenkai, Kokai restored Yamashina Izumo-ji Temple.
Cloistered Imperial Prince Joe Hosshinno (1164 - April 26, 1203) was a Cloistered Imperial Prince of the end of Heian period to the early Kamakura period.
His father was Emperor Goshirakawa.
His mother was a yujo (prostitute), Tanba no tsubone.
He was also called Sanzenin no miya or Seiryuin no miya.
He entered the priesthood under Kakuchu of Shoren-in Temple, and in 1181 he became a Isshin-ajari (a special class of the teaching priests, who are noble and permitted to play role of ajari).
In the next year, 1182, he became an adopted child of Imperial Princess Shoshi, and in 1191, he was given the title of Imperial Prince.
In the next year, 1192, he became the Betto (superior of a temple) of Jomyo-ji Temple, and in 1196, he acceded the Chori (chief priest) of Onjo-ji Temple.
Joa (1540 – August 28, 1619) was a Buddhist priest of the Jishu School and poet between the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) and the early part of the Edo period.
He called himself Ikkado.
Joa was a native of Kai Province becoming an adopted child of a busho (military commander), Nobutora TAKEDA, of that province.
It is said that, in 1547, Joa studied under Taiko (体光) at Chozen-ji Temple in Suruga Province and eventually succeeded his position as the chief priest of that temple.
Joa subsequently went to Kyoto where he developed a relationship with the renga (linked-verse) poet Joha SATOMURA and studied various literary classics including Genji Monogatari (the Tale of Genji), Ise Monogatari (the Tale of Ise) and Kokin Wakashu (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) under the court nobles Kineda SANJONISHI and Sanezumi SANJONISHI.
In 1602, Joa was invited to Yamagata as the renga poet (linked-verse poet) for Yoshiaki MOGAMI.
Later on, Joa returned to the Shichijo Dojo Training Hall in Kyoto and, in 1605, gave lectures to Emperor Goyozei.
Junson (November 28, 1585 – June 3, 1622) was a Buddhist priest and the 18th chief priest of Kosho-ji Temple.
His imina (personal name) was Shogen.
Junson was the child of Kenson, the 17th chief priest of Kosho-ji Temple and the grandchild of Kennyo, the 11th chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple.
His mother was the daughter of Tamemasu REIZEN.
His wife was the adopted daughter of Terumoto MORI (also the widow of Hideaki KOBAYAKAWA and her biological father was Motohide SHISHIDO, a senior vassal of the Mori clan).
His childhood name was Yasomaru.
His shigo (a posthumous name) was Futaiin.
Junson's daughter Yaya (also known as Jukoin) married Yorifusa TOKUGAWA of the Mito clan, producing Yoritaka MATSUDAIRA (the first lord of the Hitachi Fuchu domain).
At age 10, Junson entered the Buddhist priesthood under Junnyo, the 12th chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple (and the founder of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple) who was also Junson's uncle and the husband of his older sister.
In 1599, however, Junson became at odds with his older sister who inherited Kosho-ji Temple after the passing of their father, defecting to the Higashi Hongan-ji Temple side to which his uncle Kyonyo belonged.
However, in 1607, Junson was persuaded to return to the Nishi Hongan-ji Temple side.
During this time, Junson was promoted to the position of Hogen (the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) in 1600, Daisozu (the highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) in 1601, and finally Hoin (the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) in 1602.
In 1616, Junson was bestowed the position of Gonsojo (the lowest grade that can be held by one who has reached the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests).
Kifudo painting is a 'hibutsu' (Buddhist image normally withheld from public view) of a standing statue of Fudomyoo (cetaka), the entire body of which is yellow, handed down to Onjo-ji Temple, commonly called Mii-dera Temple, in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture.
It was a product of the early Heian period and designated a National Treasure.
It is said that it depicts the image with which a priest Enchin was in the state of enlightenment.
It is one of the 3 major Fudo, and has another name, Konjiki Fudomyoo (literally, Gold Cetaka).
Although many facsimiles of fudomyoo handed down to Manshu-in Temple in Kyoto, etc. stand on iwakura (dwelling place of a god, usually in reference to a large rock), this one was painted as standing on the empty sky fully on paper, because it depicted the actual scene of the state of enlightenment of Enchin.
Also, nothing is painted in the background, to show the state of emptiness.
Enchin was in the state of enlightenment with this Kifudo many times on Mt. Hiei and on the way to the Tang Dynasty, and he was helped by it when he was in fear of his life.
Disposition of debts of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple was an incident in which Higashi Hongan-ji Temple asked government officials for a rescue from their debts during the Meiji period.
Summary
When Higashi Hongan-ji Temple was trapped in their debt of over 3,000,000 yen, Tadakatsu UTSUMI and Denzaburo FUJITA, who were financial advisors, tried to settle the debts in vain, and finally Koei OTANI, the hoshu (high priest), and Kaien ATSUMI, Naikyoku (intra-ministerial bureau), asked Kaoru INOUE for a rescued through Masamitsu HIROHASHI and Denzaburo FUJITA.
In late December 1902, Inoue entered Kyoto accompanied by Shigeo KATAYAMA.
A petition was handed to Inoue signed by not only the authorities concerned with Higashi Hongan-ji Temple but also interested merchants.
Inoue thoroughly investigated the cause of the financial disorder and started a reform.
Reportedly, 'seeing a magnificent carriage sent by Hongan-ji Temple, Inoue rushed to the temple, saying "how dare those who ask for the deposition of the debts allow themselves such luxuries," heard financial status from concerned people from nine in the morning to six in the evening, and, with dinner served, he suddenly exploded with anger, abusively saying "how can we eat the dinner if we consider that the dinner is made from offering of good men and good women saving every single grain."'
(A scene is likely even today in which someone received by a luxury car gets angry and arrives in a taxi.)
No one but Inoue could determine and execute reduction of interest payments and borrowing beyond the value of the collateral, and he assigned Konoike-ginko Bank as the only bank of account.
It is said that their good faith was not demonstrated against his instruction to report execution of the saving in the life of the hoshu.
In June 1903, Shuntai ISHIKAWA, the former head of the temple office, was expelled and deprived of his priesthood due to the financial disorder issue.
Shukongo-shin is a Buddhist Goho zenjin (good deities protecting dharma) and is also referred to as Kongoshu and Jikongo.
The name was given because the Shukongo-shin protects Buddhism with a vajra in his hand.
The vajra symbolizes Buddha's wisdom being a weapon that destroys Bonno (earthly desires).
Although his role is the same as that of Kongo Rikishi, while Kongo Rikishi takes a form of two naked bodies of Misshaku and Naraen, Shukongo-shin is generally formed and placed as a single busho (Japanese military commander).
There is an opinion that the origin is the same as that of Kongo Rikishi (Nio).
He is called Vajrapani in India, and expressed in the form of a half-naked body.
In China and Japan, he is expressed as a bushin (god of war) in kacchu (armor and helmet) with Funnuso (an angry expression found on Buddhist images).
As surviving articles in Japan, a statue (National Treasure) in Hokkedo (Sangatsudo) of Todai-ji Temple is known.
Because it is placed in a zushi (a cupboard-like case with double doors in which an image of (the) Buddha, a sutra, or some other revered object is kept at a temple) on the north side of the Hokkedo and the doors are allowed to open only once a year, it is very well-preserved.
It is a very precious statue made in the Nara period, with gold foils and colors preserved extremely well on the surface.
A wooden statue in Kongo-in Temple (Maizuru City) in Kyoto was made by Kaikei in the Kamakura period while studying the statue in Hokkedo of Todai-ji Temple.
Monto mono shirazu' is a phrase which believers of other sects use when they criticize monto (believers) of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) as 'they don't know about the manners of Buddhism.'
Originally it was a part of the pun that made fun of various sects saying 'Believers of Jodo Shinshu Sect don't know about the manners of Buddhism, those of Hokke Sect have no backbone, those of Zen Sect have no money and those of Jodo Sect have no mercy."
Monto mono shirazu' is a phrase that ridicules the believers of Jodo Shinshu Sect, from the standpoint of other sects, who believe solely in Amida Buddha without paying any respect to other deities and Buddha and as a result, neither pay attention to rituals and practices concerning local deities and Buddha nor follow even the customs concerning funerals of the dead.
Some people, however, appreciate such characteristics of monto which other sects' believers ridicule as 'mono shirazu.'
For instance, Shundai DAZAI, a Confucian scholar in the Edo period, wrote in his book "Seigaku Mondo" (Questions and Answers on Religious Scholarship) as 'Believers of Ikko Sect (Jodo Shinshu Sect) solely believe in Amida Buddha, do not believe in any other Buddha and deities, do not conduct a prayer under any circumstances and do not use magic rituals or charms even when they are sick. All of the above are attributable to Shinran's influence.'
Another view, which asserts that the original phrase of 'monto monoimi shirazu' (monto don't know ritual abstention) or 'monto monoimi sezu' (monto don't conduct ritual abstention) has been passed down after being distorted to 'monto mono shirazu,' is sometimes cited in the preachings of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
However, it is not the case that a phrase of 'monto monoimi shirazu' and so on, had existed before the phrase of 'monto mono shirazu' was created and therefore, it is contemplated that they were created in recent years as a phrase to counter 'mono shirazu.'
While not conducting monoimi is one of the characteristics of Jodo Shinshu monto, the phrase 'monto mono shirazu' represents not only not conducting monoimi (confinement to one's house on an unlucky day) but also various unique aspects of Jodo Shinshu monto.
(regarding monoimi, refer to the article of 'monoimi' included in the section of 'Difference between Jodo Shinshu Sect and other sects' described below)
It is confirmed that a phrase of 'monto mono shirazu' appeared in "Tatoezukushi" (collection of Common Sayings), a book compiled in 1786, and "Nezumi Komon Haru no Shingata" (The Rat and the Fine Patterned New Spring Fashion), a Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) play firstly performed in 1857.
Source: Shogakukan "Nihon Kokugo Daijiten" (Complete Japanese-language dictionary)
As a matter of actual examples, this phrase is not used as a matter of doctrine but in the intercommunication with local society, such as on the occasion of funeral rituals and Buddhist services that are closely connected with local customs.
This phrase is used when believers of other sects criticize monto for not following the local customs which, at least from their viewpoint, is common.
There exist many monto who comply with the respective doctrine of the sect in question when attending Buddhist services of other sects so that they can avoid needless confrontation, and follow the doctrine of Jodo Shinshu Sect only in the event of their families' Buddhist service.
(When attending the funeral and Buddhist memorial service of Jodo Shinshu Sect, believers of other sects often have a feeling that something is wrong.)
On the occasion of funerals, and so on, relatives of the deceased or elderly people who believe in other sects sometimes instruct monto to follow different manners from those of Jodo Shinshu Sect or conventional practice based on customs or superstitions.
In the face of such a situation, some monto disobey such instructions amicably by admitting they are 'monto mono shirazu,' instead of causing confrontation by bringing forward the doctrine.
As mentioned above, monto sometimes use a phrase of 'monto mono shirazu' for their convenience.
In this section, we explain about the difference between Jodo Shinshu Sect and other sects.
Provided, however, please pay attention to the fact that the explanation in this section is to be made based on the manners of Hongan-ji School and Otani School which are dominant among various schools of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Further, Jodo Shinshu Sect has no intention to criticize other sects' manners and doctrines.
The third chapter, volume two of "Ofumi" (Gobunsho) (Rennyo's instruction to monto) states that monto must abide by the following three things.
1. Monto must not slander other doctrines and other sects.
2. Monto must not scorn other deities, other Buddha and Bosatsu.
3. Monto must devote themselves in faith in order to reincarnate in the Pure land.
Judging from the fact that a phrase of admonition to monto frequently appears in "Ofumi" (Gobunsho), it is contemplated that the difference of doctrine was a problem between monto and the believers of other sects even at that time.
Funerals can be held on the day of tomobiki (good day for business and lawsuits (trial day), literally 'pulling friends').
According to Jodo Shinshu Sect's interpretation, Rokuyo (six days of the Buddhist calendar) is, in the first place, a Chinese divination which has nothing to do with Buddhism and its interpretation was altered after it was imported into Japan.
Further, Jodo Shinshu Sect asserts that the original meaning of tomobiki was 'pulling evenly,' which was used as a term expressing a drawn match, not 'pulling friends' regardless of good or bad.
While funerals are not held on the day of tomobiki under other sects' interpretation because of anxiety for pulling friends, there is no problem to hold funerals on the day of tomobiki in Jodo Shinshu Sect.
As many funeral halls and crematories are closed on the day of tomobiki, however, even the believers of Jodo Shinshu Sect rarely hold funerals on the day of tomobiki (practically, it is impossible to hold the final service for the dead).
Traditional customs, such as a sword for protection, an upside-down folding screen, a shroud with the left side under the right, burying rokumonsen (six mon (obsolete unit of currency) coins for the world of the dead) and salt for purification, are not employed in principle.
(There exist some sects which assert that salt for purification is not necessary because it deviates from the principle of Buddhism.)
However, some monks do not refuse to use salt for purification, based on the wishes of the bereaved family, if the bereaved family hope to do so.
Kitamakura (lay a coffin with the head of deceased toward the north) derives from 'Zumen Hokusei' (the head faced to the northwest) when Shakyamuni died.
Kitamakura is not required if it is difficult to do so due to the position of a family Buddhist alter.
In other sects, it is common to write 'goreizen' (to the spirit of a dead person) on kodenbukuro (a condolence-money envelope) when attending Tsuya (funeral wake), a funeral or Buddhist memorial service to be held before the 49th day after one's death because the deceased has yet to attain Buddhahood and 'gobutsuzen' (to a dead person in the other world) when attending Buddhist memorial service to be held after 49th day memorial service.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, however, it is believed that a person who died while having faith in Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) (Tarikihongan (salvation through the benevolence of Buddha)) is able to go immediately to the Pure Land (land where Amida Nyorai resided) and reincarnate as a Buddha (Ojo soku Jobutsu (going to heaven and immediately becoming a Buddha)).
Therefore, the concept that the deceased still exists as a spirit is denied.
As a result, the concept of divine punishment is also denied in Jodo-shin Sect.
In conclusion, the recipient of koden is not the deceased (spirit) but Buddha and therefore, 'gobutsuzen,' not 'goreizen,' is used from the day of one's death.
However, believers of other religions and sects as well as free thinkers are allowed to write 'goreizen' when they attend Jodo Shinshu Sect funerals, and so on.
Such flexibility in the title of kodenbukuro is also seen by other sects' believers as monto mono shirazu.
Titles that are not linked with any religious doctrines, such as 'gokoden,' 'gokoryo' and 'gokogi' (those three means 'instead of incense sticks') are sometimes used (provided that only those of Buddhist-style are allowed).
In other sects, attendants pick up incense from an incense container, put it into an incense burner after holding it in front of the forehead and repeat such action three times.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, however, attendants pick up incense from an incense container, put it into an incense burner at once and conduct such actions once or twice.
The background of the above difference is that while other sects consider that incense is offered to three of Butsu, Ho and So (Buddha, doctrine and monks), Jodo Shinshu Sect considers that the purpose of burning incense is to purify one's own smell as etiquette required for a person who stands in front of Buddha.
Frequency of burning incense is once in the Hongan-ji school of Jodo Shinshu Sect and twice in the Otani school of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Frequency could be different depending on the practices of local parishioners.
Believers of other sects are allowed to burn incense according to the manner of their own sects.
Kaimyo' is not used in Jodo Shinshu Sect because there are no religious precepts in Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Homyo' (Jodo Shinshu Sect) is used as a name of a Buddhist.
Some sects follow the practice that define the chuin period as the period of 35 days after the death because when the chuin period of 49 days is over three months, it reminds about the phrase 'shiju ku ga mitsuki' (literally, "forty-nine days over three months," always suffer hardship), a pun based on the pronunciation of Japanese.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, however, Nanananoka Buddhist memorial service (Shijukunichi (49 days)) is held even when the chuin is over three months because it denies superstitions based on a pun, and so on.
Actually, as the case where the chuin period is over three months coincides with the case where a person died in the latter half of the month, such cases could account for more than half of all cases.
In that event, Shijukunichi itself becomes meaningless.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, the purpose of the Buddhist memorial service during the chuin period is to get attendants to deeply contemplate the meaning of life and death as well as the teachings of Buddha taking the opportunity of their close relative's death.
Unlike other sects, it is not a Buddhist memorial service which prays for attaining Buddhahood.
Among Buddhist memorial services to be held during the chuin period, a memorial service of Nanananoka (also referred as Jinshichinichi or Shijukunichi) is generally held at a family temple or in front of a family Buddhist alter at home and deemed as the most important one.
In the event of Shonanoka (a memorial service on the sixth day after the death), Shogakki (a memorial service on the day of a month after the death) and Itsunanoka (a memorial service on the 35th day after the death), it is believed to be preferable to visit a family temple or invite a monk.
Futananoka (a memorial service on the 14th day after the death), Minanoka (a memorial service on the 21st day after the death), Shinanoka (a memorial service on the 28th day after the death) and Munanoka (a memorial service on the 42nd day after the death) can be held in front of a family alter with only relatives' attendance, though it is preferable to invite a monk.
Recently, the Shonanoka memorial service is often brought forward and held after a cremation (haiso (literally ash funeral), kanso (literally, funeral for return).
Depending on local practices, Itsunanoka (35th day) is sometimes the final Buddhist memorial service, instead of Shijukunichi (Nanananoka), during the chuin period.
In some regions, 'Shonanoka' is called 'Ichinanoka' (literally, one seven day) or 'Ikkananoka' (literally, one day and seven day).
In other sects, kaimyo is written on ihai and when the number of ihai increased substantially, they are abolished and kaimyo is removed to Kakocho (a family register of dead).
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, however, plain wood ihai is used only up to a Buddhist memorial service of Nanananoka (Shijukunichi memorial service or memorial service of Manchuin (full chuin)) and homyo is written on it.
Such plain wood ihai is used only for convenience sake and is nothing more than a nameplate of homyo.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, the concept that a soul resides in ihai doesn't exist.
Homyo is transferred from plain wood ihai to Homyo-jiku (a white hanging scroll which is a little smaller than that of the principal image) or a small folded book called Kakocho after Shijukunichi memorial service and it is used thereafter.
As the target of worship in Jodo Shinshu Sect is only Amida Buddha based on its doctrine, Homyo-jiku and Kakocho are not the target of worship.
(Hongan-ji School generally uses Kakocho rather than Homyo-jiku)
In some regions, however, 'Kuridashi-ihai' (a set of mortuary tablets which can be taken out one by one) is used (Hongan-ji School in Chugoku region, and so on).
Takada School uses ihai.
In other sects, a ritual for transferring a soul from plain wood ihai to real ihai is held on the occasion of Manchuin memorial service or Hyakkanichi memorial service (memorial service on the 100th day after death) and plain wood ihai is burnt thereafter.
Such a ritual, however, is not held in Jodo Shinshu Sect because it does not place particular significance, such as the idea that a soul resides in it, on ihai.
(Therefore, other sects have an impression that Jodo Shinshu Sect burns plain wood ihai in which a soul resides.)
In other sects, especially in the schools of Zen Sect, a big amount of fuse is requested because fuse (a fee for chanting sutra, a fee for kaimyo, and so on) is deemed as an expression of faith which substitutes for ascetic practices.
Although it depends on the status of the family concerned, it is not uncommon to see a case, especially in the case of funerals, where fuse of hundreds of thousands of yen to more than one million yen is requested.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, chanting Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) is deemed as the expression of faith and fuse to be paid on the occasion of funeral, and so on is a kind of donation for maintaining a temple, an exercise hall for listening to the teachings of Buddha (Monpo (listening to the teachings of Buddha)).
Monks' chanting of sutra and gemon (Recitation of verses) at a funeral etc. is hosse (preaching Buddhism) and it is supposedly free of charge.
(An idea of homyo fee or chanting sutra fee doesn't exist.)
In reality, however, fuse at funerals is the biggest income for temples and it is impossible to maintain temples without it.
The amount of fuse at a funeral is generally between tens of thousands of yen to hundreds of thousands of yen, though it varies depending on the scale of the funeral in question.
The amount of annual myogakin (money to dedicate) to be paid to a family temple and a head temple is generally a few thousand yen for each.
Kin butsudan (golden alter) is recommended in Jodo Shinshu Sect.
(However, there is no problem to use karaki butsudan (rare foreign wood alter) or contemporary-style butsudan.)
Further, Jodo Shinshu Sect regulations on alters and butsugu (Buddhist alter fittings) are more detailed than those of other sects.
Those of Hongan-ji School and Otani School are particularly strict.
In contemporary terms, butsudan is deemed as a mini-copy (a dummy) of the head temple and accordingly, it is modeled after the inner sanctuary of the main hall of each sect's head temple.
Its main image should be a hanging scroll (a painting image) obtained from the head temple.
On the scroll, there exists a writing 'Hobenhisshin no Songyo' (a tentative image of Buddha) as well as the signature and seal of the chief priest of the sect.
While a Buddhist statue, rather than a hanging scroll, is recommended in other sects, a hanging scroll (a painting image or Myogo (name of Buddha)), rather than a Buddhist statue, is recommended in Jodo Shinshu Sect.
The above is based on the following description of "Rennyo-shonin Goichidai-ki Kikigaki" (a record of what was heard about the whole life of the holy priest Rennyo), which compiled from what Rennyo Shonin told.
"Other sects recommend a painted image rather than myogo, a wooden image rather than a painted image. Our sect recommend a painted image rather than a wooden image, myogo rather than a painted image."
From the above, we can infer the characteristics of Jodo Shinshu Sect which emphasizes nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) (faith).
A glass or teacup shouldn't be used when offering water or tea.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, water should be served on uwajoku (a table situated in front of the principal image) as purified water (fragrant water) using Buddhist alter fittings called kebyo with branches and leaves of shikimi (Japanese star anise) put into it.
(Offering water or tea can be omitted in case butsudan is small or mitsuori-honzon (the principal image which can be folded into thirds) is enshrined.)
Only fresh flowers, not artificial flowers or artificial lotus flowers (one of Buddhist alter fittings), should be used.
In ordinary times, only obuku (also referred as obuppan, rice served for a family Buddhist alter) should be served.
On the occasion of events such as Higan (vernal and autumnal equinox festivals) and Bon Festival (the festival of the dead), small rice cakes which are placed on kuge (offering stand) should be served.
(In Hongan-ji school, cakes and fruits are also served other than small rice cakes. Ryoguzen tray (one of Buddhist alter fittings) should not be used.)
Gifts or favorite food of the deceased should be served outside of the family Buddhist alter.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, only Amida Nyorai is the object of worship.
Ihai and the picture of the deceased shouldn't be put inside the Family Buddhist alter.
Pictures should be displayed at a position which is not right above the family Buddhist alter, such as on nageshi (a horizontal piece of timber) situated beside it, for the purpose of recalling the deceased.
Monto should put the palms of hands together while chanting 'Namu Amidabutsu' even if other sects' main image (such as Dainichi-nyorai and Shakyamuni-nyorai) is enshrined.
The reason for the above is because "Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo Sutra" preaches that Amida Nyorai's vows (Forty eight vows) are admitted by various Buddha.
It is said, however, that as a matter of etiquette, nenbutsu should be chanted in a whisper which cannot be heard by those around or at heart in order not to make believers of other sects uncomfortable.
While one or three burning sticks are stood in koro (incense burner) in other sects, in Jodo Shinshu Sect, incense sticks are laid down in koro after being broken into a few pieces for which the length is suitable for the size of koro.
There is no problem to serve four sticks after breaking two incense sticks into four.
(Jodo Shinshu Sect denies a superstition deriving from a pun of shi (four) meaning shi (death).)
Depending on the region, an incense stick is broken into three pieces like the practice in other sects.
The reason why the believers of other sects stand an incense stick after breaking it into three is because they believe each of the three sticks represents Buddha, teachings of Buddha and Buddhist monks respectively or the present, the past and the future respectively.
In some sects other than Jodo Shinshu Sect, breaking an incense stick is sometimes regarded as ominous.
By breaking an incense stick, burning time can be shortened and the risk of fire can also be reduced.
Further, as incense sticks are laid on ashes instead of being stood, they burn themselves out and no cinders remain in ashes.
Even if an incense stick is broken by mistake, it doesn't come to nothing.
It can be said that this practice of nenko represents Jodo Shinshu Sect's reasonable way of thinking.
A graveyard is defined in Jodo Shinshu Sect as a place to house the remains of the dead.
Visiting a grave is an opportunity to confirm the relation with, as well as faith in, Buddha and its significance is to recall the deceased who was salvaged by Amida Nyorai and to give thanks for being a person who might also be salvaged at some time.
On a gravestone, the word of 'Namu Amidabutsu' (南無阿弥陀仏) or 'Kue-issho' (具会一処) should be written in principle.
When visiting a graveyard with only a family name written on it, visitors should bring an object of worship, such as mitsuori honzon, and worship it while putting the palms of the hands together, chanting nenbutsu and invocating the name of Buddha.
Like in other sects, there exist many gravestones with only the word of '... family' written on them.
As Jodo Shinshu Sect denies the notion of boso (the properties of a grave, such as its style and shape, which may affect one's fortune) as a groundless superstition, it prohibits the building of Kissobaka (a grave with properties which may lead to good fortune).
Further, as Jodo Shinshu Sect does not place any particular significance on a gravestone, it instructs monto not to build gorinto (a gravestone composed of five pieces piled up one upon another) and not to stick to the direction of gravestone.
Since the notion of Tsuizen-kuyo (religious service for the repose of the soul of the deceased) does not exist in Jodo Shinshu Sect, sotoba (a tall, narrow wooden tablet set up behind a gravestone for the repose of the deceased) is not necessary.
Some monto place a portion of the remains at Nishi Otani or Higashi Otani in Kyoto, the graveyard of the holy priest Shinran, separately from their own family graveyard.
In this case, remains that were once placed there cannot be taken out because all remains are placed in the same place.
Monto do not cling to remains and graves traditionally and not a few monto in the regions of Omi, Hokuriku and Tokai, so-called monto regions, place all of the remains at the grave of the holy priest Shinran without having their family graves.
The notion of 'Tatari of the dead' doesn't exist in Jodo Shinshu Sect.
This is because according to the teachings of Jodo Shinshu Sect, the dead immediately reincarnate as Buddha in the Pure Land (going to heaven and immediately becoming a Buddha) and therefore, they never wander in this world as souls.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, devotional exercises every morning and evening, in which monto worship Amida Nyorai while putting the palms of the hands together, chanting nenbutsu and invocating the name of Buddha and thanking the holy priest Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Sect, as well as Seven masters of Jodo Shinshu Sect for their efforts in preaching the teachings of Buddha, are deemed as memorial services for the ancestors.
In the event of memorial services held at family temples, it is desirable to attend and practice monpo (listening to the teachings of Buddha) wherever possible.
The above is based on the thought that particular events of memorial services are unnecessary since the deceased have already become Buddha by Other-power (Amida Nyorai's power).
From the viewpoint of other sects' believers, however, such a practice is proof that monto do not know about ordinary Buddhist memorial services (such as Segaki (hungry ghosts' feeding rites) at the Urabon-e festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Soul's Day, around the 15th of July or August, depending on local customs)).
The notion of 'Eitai Kuyo' doesn't exist in Jodo Shinshu Sect.
Though the notion of Eitai-kyo (eternal sutra reciting) does exist, its purpose is not for memorial services but for the eternal continuation of sutra reciting, existence of temples and spreading of the teachings.
Eitai-kyo' in Jodo Shinshu Sect is sutra reciting which is conducted on shotsuki-meinichi (the anniversaries of one's death after the first anniversary) and at Higan-e in spring and autumn and its purpose is to thank the ancestors.
It is the opportunity for those in life to remind the teachings of Buddha.
Monto of Jodo Shinshu Sect have neither omamori nor ofuda.
The reason for the above is the doctrine by which monto are encouraged not to be shackled by superstitions and to live while facing up to reality.
Kaichumyogo (a pocketable paper with the name of Amida-nyorai written on it) of Hongan-ji School is the remains of what was given during wartime (Pacific war) to soldiers when they were called up.
Some monks of the school consider that it should be abolished because unlike Mitsuori-honzon, it is the same thing with omamori.
(Some monks of Hongan-ji School consider, to the contrary, that it is good behavior to always bring an object of worship.)
In this connection, kaichu-myogo doesn't exist in Otani School.
As Jodo Shinshu Sect doesn't understand a death as uncleanness, monoimi is not conducted.
For the same reason, salt for purification is not used in funerals.
In chapter ninth of volume one in "Ofumi" (Gobunsho), Rennyo Shonin stated that monoimi should not be conducted in Jodo Shinshu Sect saying 'next, regarding monoimi, our sect does not abstain from anything based on the doctrine of Buddhism.'
However, Rennyo Shonin subsequently advised monto not to make fun of or condemn believers of other sects (because they conduct monoimi) on the grounds that monto do not conduct monoimi by saying as follows.
In other sects, there is no reason for not conducting Monoimi for kubo (shogunal representative). There is no problem for believers of other sects'/schools' to conduct monoimi. Further, monto must not slander believers of other sects for conducting monoimi.'
In a nutshell, Jodo Shinshu Sect prohibits monto from conducting monoimi.
Further, it cites a paragraph of "Nehan-gyo Sutra" (The Sutra of The Great Nirvana) and "Hanju-kyo Sutra" (also known as Hanju Zanmai-kyo Sutra (Sutra of the Meditation to Behold the Buddha)) as the authority for not conducting monoimi and by these sutras, it also pointed out that all Buddhists, not monto alone, don't stick to selecting kichijitsu (the happiest day among Rokuyo).
As described above, what is in compliance with the teachings of Buddhism from the viewpoint of monto is taken by the believers of other sects as mono shirazu (don't know anything) and such a misunderstanding sometimes causes conflict.
"Hannya Shingyo Sutra," which is widely used in other sects, is not used in Jodo Shinshu Sect, because its teachings of self-attainment through its own exercises is inconsistent with the teaching of Jodo Shinshu Sect that emphasizes salvation through the benevolence of Amida Buddha.
When visiting sacred places such as temples, some believers of other sects place goshuin on Shuin-cho (a notebook for sealing red seals of various sacred places) for record.
In Jodo Shinshu Sect, however, placing goshuin is not recommended because its teachings don't place importance on visiting many temples.
However, it doesn't ban monto's visiting various temples.
The reason for the above is because according to the thoughts of Jodo Shinshu Sect, the purpose of visiting many temples is not collecting many goshuin but coming in to contact with many doctrines (teachings).
In recent years, it is increasingly becoming difficult to pass down the teachings of Jodo Shinshu Sect due to the trend towards the nuclear family and the ever-increasing flow of young people to urban areas.
Especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area where Jodo Shinshu Sect has not been so prevalent from the beginning, many monto, though they belong to temples affiliated to Jodo Shinshu Sect, are confusing the rituals and manners of other sects with those of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
As a result, many of monto's descendants are not aware of the meaning of Tariki Hongan (by Amida Nyorai) and the unique rituals and manners of Jodo Shinshu Sect.
At present, it could be said that 'Monto omo shirazu' (believers of Jodo Shinshu Sect are unaware of even the fact that they are monto).
The Running Priest (November 20, 1872 – November 20, 1918) was a Buddhist priest known for his eccentricity of running around the streets of Kyoto City all day long in the Meiji and Taisho periods.
The real name of the Running Priest was Tsuneji NITTA, with his Buddhist name being Genkyo HATA, but he was commonly referred to 'Hashiri Bozu,' 'Hashiri Bosan' (the Running Priest) or 'Tsune-san.'
The birthplace of Genkyo was Sechigo (later incorporated in Kaizuka City), Kishima-mura, Sennan-gun, Osaka Prefecture.
At age 18, he became a pupil at Dairen-ji Temple (Kyoto City) in Kyoto.
The Dairen-ji Temple of the time was located at Gojo-dori sagaru, Butsuguya-cho, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, but in conjunction with the widening of Gojo-dori Street during World War II, it was relocated to Okazaki, Sakyo Ward.
It is said that at the time he began life at the temple, Genkyo was so small that he need only pay the child fare when riding the train; he was also said to be sickly.
It is considered that his life reached a turning point when he began running around the city streets soliciting donations for the reconstruction of the Hondo (main building) and Kannon-do Hall (temple dedicated to Kannon) of the temple.
Thereafter, after finishing the morning religious service, even if it was wet or blustery, Genkyo, wearing a priest's robe and carrying a soiled Zudabukuro (a bag for carrying such items as a text of a sutra or tableware, and which is hung from the neck when a priest travels) ran handing out the temple's ofuda (paper charms) in the streets every day.
Genkyo was a regular visitor to the ghetto areas, unconcerned about giving his own money away and, although he received offerings from rich believers at times, his Zudabukuro was always empty.
Though no one knows when, people started to call him the 'present-day Ikkyu (a Rinzai sect monk of mid-Muromachi period).'
Additionally, leaving the temple before dawn once a month Genkyo climbed Mt. Kurama via Mt. Daimonji and Mt. Hiei, continuing on to make a pilgrimage to Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City) on the top of Mt. Atago before returning to Dairen-ji Temple.
Since Genkyo was such a great walker, there is an anecdote that a novice deliveryman came to ask him for pointers to follow his example.
It is said that Genkyo was a big eater and drinker, consuming 1.8 liters each of rice, sake and rice cakes a day and easily polishing off 50 rice cakes in zoni (a kind of vegetable soup with rice cakes) served on New Year's Day.
The large red-lacquered bowl that Genkyo used for his daily meals was left intact.
It is said, however, that Genkyo had no interest in women and whenever a woman made advances, as soon as he finished collecting offerings from believers and eating Otoki (a meal served at a Buddhist memorial service), he said 'Well, have a good day' and started to run at full speed again.
Having a weakness for sake, there were some incidents where Genkyo ran into a post when drunk and bumped his nose, and that he was taken to a police box, but it is said that as soon as he was identified as the 'Running Priest,' he was immediately let go.
On November 20, 1918, Genkyo died from the influenza that swept throughout Japan.
It is said that Genkyo never stopped drinking even after falling ill with influenza and continued to drink until he died.
In 1993, the life of Genkyo was covered by a TV show "Do Detectives! Scoop at Night" and in 1995, a picture book entitled the "Running Priest in Kyoto" (written by Yoshihisa AZUMA and illustrated by Kofu MUI), an adaptation based on the deeds performed by the real Running Priest, was published by Creo (ISBN 4906371795).
Torin-in Temple is one of the sub-temples of Myoshin-ji Temple of the Rinzai sect.
Torin-in Temple is renowned for the treasured 300 year-old sal tree (Shorea robusta) on its grounds.
It is commonly known as the Temple of Sal Tree.
The origin of Torin-in Temple lies in Sanyu-in Temple which was erected in 1531 by Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA to pray to Buddha for the happiness of his deceased father, and was located in present Kamigyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City.
In 1556, Toyokuni YAMANA relocated Sanyu-in Temple to the grounds of Myoshin-ji Temple, changing its name to the current Torin-in Temple.
At this time Torin-in Temple became the ancestral temple of the Yamana clan from the original family temple of the Hosokawa clan.
The present resident priest Genbo NISHIKAWA is well-known as a Buddhist vegetarian food researcher, currently offering a Buddhist vegetarian cooking class (by appointment only) on Tuesdays and, in addition, reservations for a party of 3 or more are accepted for sampling a Buddhist vegetarian meal on the premises.
Torin-ji Temple is not open to the public as a rule but special admission is permitted on the occasions of the 'rice and azuki bean porridge party' in January and the 'sal tree viewing' event in June every year.
Torin-in Temple offers lodging services on the premises.
Lodging reservations must be made in advance by sending a return postcard (a postcard with a reply card attached).
Goma is a phonetic translation of a Sanskrit word 'homa' into Japanese.
It is a Brahmanic ritual, described in the holy writings of Vedas, which began around 2000 BC in India and it is considered to have been adopted into Buddhism during the process of Mahayana Buddhism's coming into existence approximately 500 years after the death of Shakyamuni.
Goma, therefore, is a practice peculiar to esoteric Buddhism (a school of Mahayana Buddhism) and does not exist in Theravada Buddhism which is supposed to approximate the actual teachings of Shakyamuni in his own words.
Goma is primarily practiced by the Shingon and Tendai sects.
This ceremony evolved from a simple ritual to win god's grace by burning firewood cut into sticks in a Goma fire pit while throwing various offerings into the fire for the fire god to carry the offerings, transformed into smoke, to heaven.
Fire is believed to purify all that is seen and unseen, and one focuses one's attention to make a profound observation of Buddha in a place of purity within the burning fire.
There is an external goma fire ritual where one prays by building a fire in the gomadan (an altar for the fire ceremony) in which offerings and subsequently the gomaki (wood for ritual burning) are thrown, and an internal goma fire ritual where one regards oneself as the gomadan itself which is lit by the fire of the Buddha's prajna (wisdom) in order to burn away bonno (earthly desires) and karma (sins).
Additionally, depending on the individual objective the goma fire ritual is generally broken down into the following 5 categories:
1. The prayer for safety and good health: to pray to circumvent various calamities including drought, wind storms, floods, earthquakes, and fires; personal sufferings and the overcoming of earthly desires are also included in the prayer.
2.The prayer for happiness: to pray not only to circumvent calamities but also to increase happiness in a proactive manner.
This is a prayer for happiness, wealth and prosperity.
Longevity and matchmaking are also included in this prayer.
3. The Chobuku-ho prayer: to pray to eliminate bitter enemies and matters interfering with the teachings of Buddha.
With its objective being to suppress evil-deeds, it is performed by an Ajari (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) who is superior to priests performing the other categories of prayer.
4. The Keiai-ho prayer: in contrast to Chobuku, this is a prayer to respect and love others and to wish for a peaceful world.
5. The Kocho-ho prayer: a prayer to attract Shoson (a generic term for entities to be respected in Buddhism such as Nyorai (Tathagata), Bosatsu (Bodhisattva), Myoo and heaven), Zenjin (good deities) and those one loves.
The Outdoor goma service
The goma service performed outdoors is referred to as the Saito goma, with the Shingon sect line Tozan school using the kanji meaning 'firewood light' for 'Saito' as it was impossible to decorate the esoteric tools such as Buddha statues and temples in a formal manner in the mountains where they built the gomadan with firewood or logs, whereas the Tendai sect line Honzan school uses the kanji meaning 'receiving the light' as that school acquires light from the saito of the Shingon sect line Tozan school to perform the goma.
Additionally, the Shinnyo-en Buddhist Order, one of the new religions adopting the teaching of the Shingon sect line Tozan school uses the kanji meaning 'equally bring together to improve' because the goma burns away every suffering from the effects of karma and fate.
Gomakasu' means to cover up to avoid something disadvantageous, but one theory suggests the word originates from 'goma.'
This word began to be used in the Edo Period and it has been suggested that there were numerous incidents where ordinary ashes were sold as ashes from the goma fire ritual performed by Kukai (Kobo Daishi) whereby the term 'magirakasu' (to disguise) evolved to 'gomakasu' (to disguise) consisting of 'goma' and the same conjunction 'kasu' used in 'magirakasu.'
However, there are additional explanations concerning the origin of the word 'gomakasu' where 'gomakasu' derived from the fact that there was no way of knowing what was written on the gomaki wood which was to be burned anyway, that it originated from 'gomakashi' (goma pastry) having a hollow middle with no filling inside and that one could always sprinkle some sesame seeds (goma) on pastries to disguise its unsavory taste.
Zen (the Zen sect) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism which is regarded as having been established in China after being transmitted from India by Daruma (Bodhidharma).
It does not have a central sutra because of the principle of furyumonji (the thought that the status of enlightenment cannot be expressed in characters or discourses) and emphasizes shishi sosho (transmission of the teachings and the way of Buddhism from a teacher to a disciple) because of the principle of transmission of spiritual awakening without words or characters and in a heart-to-heart way.
It is characterized by various means such as occasion-suited telepathy (direct communication from mind to mind) for those principles.
Its basic form of ascetic practices is meditation, which has been an important type of virtue for the basic practice of Buddhism since ancient times, and the Buddhist group which practiced mediation began to be called Zen sect from the end of the Tang Dynasty in China.
Later, when the origin of the Zen sect was actively sought, in accordance with its establishment, Daruma was regarded as the founder.
The Zen which Daruma introduced was that of Mahayana Buddhism of ryogi (teaching the whole truth after clarifying it), different from that in early Buddhist schools.
The term Zen generally refers to the Zen sect, but also refers to zenna (a practice to attain enlightenment on the truth with calm emotion and clear mind) depending on a context or a case.
Since Gotama Siddhattha (Shakyamuni, Buddha), the founder of Buddhism, gave the missionary work of Buddhism to Mahakasyapa (Judai deshi (The Ten Chief Disciples of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni)) as the Right Dharma of furyumonji and the transmission of spiritual awakening without words or characters, it has been succeeded up until the 28h Bodhidharma (Bodai Daruma).
In China it was succeeded by sixth generations from Daruma to Daikan Zenshi, and was succeeded from Kido Chigu to Daio Kokushi (the most reverend priest) and Daito Kokushi in Japan after the emergence of Goke Shichishu (five sects and seven schools derived from the original Zen Buddhism), which led to the present Zen.
It was also known as the Busshin sect, the Daruma sect and the Ryoga sect for a certain period of time.
It aims to develop a new concept of values based on experience to access the truth of Buddhism directly through continuous ascetic practices called mediation, in order to rediscover the Buddhahood which is fundamentally equipped in all people's minds without exception.
Its purpose is to clear the juni-innen (the 12 nidanas (continuum of twelve phases that lead to suffering)) of Shogyo Mujo (All things must pass) with the wisdom (prajna in Sanskrit) evoked by the enlightenment gained through the above process, to reach nirvana after diminishing the nidanas and being liberated from earthly desires and the woes of man, and to lead all living things finally.
Therefore, it is regarded as the true way to show the nature directly without using words except for the direct teaching from a master to a practitioner of austerities on a case-by-case basis.
The reason why mediation is adopted as a major form of ascetic practice is that many Buddha were regarded to reach enlightenment through mediation from ancient times, other than the fact that Daruma Daishi introduced mediation.
Recently, some professors of physiology say that the activation and building up of serotonergic neurons and the emergence of unusual particular alpha waves (alpha wave) by practicing mediation leads to inner stability and health of mind and body.
However, since a person who reaches the mental state where he or she is fundamentally the same entity as Buddha comes to have the value that all activities include Buddhism, he or she also comes to practice nenbutsu (Buddhist prayer) and sutra chanting as well as mediation.
The Zen sect tends to dislike metaphysical questions such as what the Zen sect is.
This is because the answer to such a question should be to be aware by oneself individually through the enlightenment gained by mediation, and because what is taught by others goes against the true intention of the Zen sect to return to the inner nature since one's consciousness has already faced outside instead of inside.
The other reason is that it avoids to fix the idea or discernment as a 'biased view' or 'obsession' based on the selfish interpretation, and that it encourages to discern after reaching the free mental state escaped from the biased view through mediation as a non biased discernment.
The reason to recommend mediation with avoiding to teach by characters and words is that not only it believes strongly the historical events of telepathy in Seson nenge, Kasho bisho (when Buddha held up a the flower on his deathbed, only Mahakassapa smiled among his disciples by knowing what he meant), but also it preaches that it prevents the accomplishment of Buddhism to seek Buddha in sutras and others with forgetting the fact that Buddha exists in the inner bottom of oneself.
Takuan Soho Osho (high priest) metaphorically spoke as follows.
Even if you explain about water, you can not be wet actually, and even if you explain about fire very well, you can not feel hot actually.'
It is the same as you can not feel clearly unless you touch real water and real fire.'
It is the same as when you are still hungry even if you have been explained about food.'
It insists the importance of an experience to notice the inner Buddha of oneself actually, and that its experience exists in the stage which can not be reached through the understanding of words and characters but reached by heightening the mental state of Dhyana, Meditation (Mental Concentration) through mediation.
The mediation of the Zen sect is classified into the four categories.
Gufu Shogyo Zen (Zen meditation practiced by ordinary persons and believers of religions other than Buddhism)
It is a mental state of Bonpu (ordinary person) and Gedo (a believer of heretical doctrine other than Buddhism) to think simply that the empty mind with no discernment is Dhyana-Mediation.
The Daruma Daishi explained that if this mental state with no squirm inside and no request to the outside becomes firm like a wall, a person can enter Buddhism for the first time.
Kansatsu Sogi Zen (Zen practice for Hinayana and Bodhisattva at earlier stages to see the learned teachings of Buddha)
It is a mental state of Hinayana Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) and the Bosatsu in three earlier states before the 10 holy states to see the learned teachings of Buddha and meditate.
However, he or she has not reached enlightenment because of the strong desire to seek Buddhism and nirvana.
The reason why people can not escape from the transmigration of troubles is that such selfish desires lead to bad karma as a result.
A Zen master Muso Soseki preached that if a person forgets oneself, throws away all one's desires and becomes altruistic, one can immediately become a living Buddha by an emergence of the Buddhahood.
Hanen Nyojitsu Zen (Zen practice for Mahayana Bodhisattva to view philosophically the world)
It is a mental status of Mahayana Bosatsu to notice the middle way (in the presence of two contradictory positions, performing practice freely without leaning toward either of them), forget three kinds of karma, and become philosophical about existence in Buddhism as neither existing nor vacuity.
It sympathized with the suffering of all living things in life and death and worries himself to give delight by removing suffering in those whose attitude is not different with himself.
However, since he or she has a desire to relieve living things, he or she cannot enter Zen practice reaching the same status as Buddha with the holy wisdom lead by ones own power.
Nyorai Seijo Zen (Zen practice reaching the same status as Buddha with the holy wisdom lead by ones own power)
It is the mental state to enter the same status as that of Nyorai (Tathagata) and to have holy wisdom by ones own awareness.
In the Zen sect, returning to the original state of mind and original Buddhahood unconsciously by mediation means to jump over the above two Zen and reach directly to this status from the Zen meditation practice done by ordinary persons and a believer of any religion other than Buddhism.
Therefore, Jugo (the 10 titles Buddha) and Bosatsu are regarded as unimportant details.
Some ancient people said that there existed a fifth status above these, that is, Zen practice to lead people without Zen practice to reach the same status as Buddha with the holy wisdom lead by ons own power.
In addition, the details of the step-up from the Zen meditation practice done by ordinary persons and a believer of a religion other than Buddhism, to the Zen practice reaching the same status as Buddha with the holy wisdom lead by ones own power, are shown in "Tetsugan-zenji Kana Hogo" (Zen-master Tetsugan's Explanation of the teachings of Buddha in kana).
It is Hoben-horin (the teachings of Buddha for disciples and others, which was categorized by the Chinese priest Dosho).
The word 'Hoben' is used in the sense of a possible method to transmit the true intention of Buddha and Zen masters although it is not the true intention itself.
Besides, it means the flexible mental attitude to seek about how to realize the order.
It is like the Gaku (学) of the Kyo sect, Sanmitsu (three secret functions of Buddha) of the Shingon sect and the commandment of the Ritsu sect.
Shikantaza (do only meditation as much as possible)
It means to do only meditation earnestly.
The word 'earnestly' shows the depth of Dhyana - Meditation.
It means to do mediation with discarding consciousness and to identify oneself with mediation itself.
It means to devote oneself to the action of mediation itself as earnestly as a person forgets even his or her existence by doing mediation.
This method is regarded to make it possible for even a beginner to experience a deeper mental state of Dhyana (Mediation).
However, since the Zen sect is occasion-suited and Mahayana Buddhism considers Buddhism as being included in all ways, it does not forbid to do other things except mediation, but it is difficult for a beginner to understand these things.
Therefore, as an easy way for a beginner, it is said that Shikantaza and shushoichinyo (practice is not for enlightenment, but they are combined and cannot be divided) are the secrets of the Zen sect.
Katsu (the words uttered when reprove persons are practicing asceticism in Zen Buddhism) which says that there is no difference in social standing in the mental status of mediation and that people in mediation are all Buddha equally, is a kind of metaphysical matter of expediency to promote Shikantaza.
However, since it is considered that even if a person cannot reach enlightenment he or she can reach it in the next life by the kudoku (merit) of mediation, and the nominal interpretation that he or she can be Buddha immediately through mediation is not necessarily false.
As to the speed of the accomplishment of Buddhism, Daruma said that a person whose mind was already filled with Buddhism could reach it early while a person who practiced gradually after having an aim could reach it late, and that there was a long distance of a million kalpa (the longest time unit in the ancient India) between them.
A set of katsu in the sense that a person who does mediation deeply and rightly can reach enlightenment early and a person who does not do it can reach it late, is a way of expression to strengthen the practice of mediation rather than studying.
Koanzen (a method to learn the secrets of Zen by providing questions to a person seeking the secrets)
The reason why Daruma Daishi traveled from the west is said that he or she worried about the decline of Buddhism abroad and hoped to teach that what was important for enlightenment was the practice of mediation and was not studying sutras.
However, even after being taught to stop thinking, discussing and studying, Shikantaza is not an easy way for a practitioner of austerities who tends to start thinking, discussing and studying about the reason for them.
Such a practitioner, even if he or she studies sutra, tends to interpret it with imagination because he or she can not raise sympathy with enlightenment.
Many masters have been worried about such a situation as the obsession caused by unreasonable imagination makes his or her understanding distorted and he or she becomes remote prevented by his own contortions.
Even when he or she studies sutra, what is necessary at first is an experience of enlightenment.
The enlightenment is to confirm one's mind with one's mind and understand one's mind by one's mind.
It is not something to be got by using others except oneself such as clearing something by depending others.
Therefore, it is important to face oneself at first through the practice of mediation in order to reach enlightenment above all.
Koanzen is a method which was produced by Zen masters in order to make the practitioners who tended to think practice mediation caused by these problems.
It gives a practitioner koan (questions from a master to a person seeking the secret of Zen to avoid deviation from the correct way) and makes him or her think its answer while Gyojuzaga (basic behavior for human living, namely, go, stop, sit and sleep).
Koan
Koan is what shows the mental status of enlightenment directly and is an emotion which is integrated into inspiration and difficult to show.
This is given to a practitioner whose attitude is not good and who may go to the wrong direction, from a Zen master, just like a medicine.
The words of ancient high priests are sometimes used, while it is made extemporaneously.
The practitioner who is given koan is requested to be correctly aware of the intention of the words and answer from the heart in front of his or her master.
Many koan consist of an inconsistent style of words and it is difficult to understand the literal meaning logically.
The answer of koan is often far from the thinking based on common-sense and tends to dissolve contradiction by erasing one's consciousness and to sublate and integrate it in a higher stage.
It is said that the secret of Zen is included in such a process to reach an answer and that koan is one of the devices to lead a practitioner to enlightenment.
However, it is said that such a way to meditate instead of studying is suitable for priests who can be directed and guarded by good Zen masters and that lay believers need to do both mediation and studying.
Naikan (reflection to see one's own spiritual and physical properties of Buddha)
The reason why the ascetic practices of Zen are strict and masters daringly afflict Zen practitioners, is that a rich and happy person finds it difficult to seek Buddhism.
This is regarded as the same reason why enthroned Shakyamuni abdicated the luxury life to pursue pleasure with a princess, by the fortune of the whole country, and became a priest and practiced asceticism for six years.
If a person meditates desperately when he or she is suffering from a sudden disease and hoping to fall senseless and die, it would be a good opportunity to reach great enlightenment.
Even when he or she cannot reach great enlightenment, if he or she is reminded of the hardship at that time, his or her suffering in life would be of no significance.
In addition, such a mental preparation as the blessing to break the endless ambivalence of life and death and reach Nyorai's enlightenment cannot be got with a little hardships and troubles.
However, the Zen master Hakuin worried about the practitioner who did too much mediation and suffered from a nervous breakdown (decrease in positive activity of the brain), and gave the secret of Naikan as a method of healing.
It is a method to take a rest in order to cure the Zen disease caused by nervous breakdown, and it consists of 24 hours sleeping, image training of the Zen sect, susokukan (method to achieve spiritual concentration and stability by counting the number of breaths) and tanden kokyu (respiration by working the inner part of the lower abdomen just beneath the navel).
Nishushigyo (the way to the two truths and the methods for four practices)
It is the way to the two truths and the methods for four practices, which is said to be introduced by Daruma.
It is said that many methods to reach enlightenment are summarized into these two.
The word 'Dhyāna' in Sanskrit and the word 'Jhāna' in Pali were transferred to Zenna (a practice to attain enlightenment of the truth with calm emotion and clear mind) and Zen (禅) in China.
It was officially written as Zen (禪), and turned to the present character after the problems that occurred pertaining to the national script (daily-use kanji (superseded in 1981), kanji for common use (list of 1945 kanji established in 1981) and list of 1006 kanji taught in Japanese primary schools).
The pronunciation in present-day Mandarin is 'chan.'
The meaning of the letter Zen is to enshrine heaven, mountains and rives, give and present or open.
It is translated freely into Dhyana (Meditation) by adding the following meanings to the transcription; the meaning of concentration of mind which leads to the word 'Zen' and the meaning of calm without upsetting which leads to the word 'Jo' (定).
According to Zengen Shosenshu Tojo (Commentary of the Ch'an-yuan-chu-ch'uan-chi tu-hsu) written by Guifeng Zongmi, the origin of Zen exists in bussho (the Buddhist nature), to be aware bussho is the wisdom, to practice wisdom is jo and the word Zenna means all of them.
In addition, it says that it was named as the Zen sect because only the religious Doctrine which was introduced by Daruma corresponded to the true Zenna.
There are other translations such as Shiyuishu, Joryo, Kiaku, Kudokusorin and Nenshu.
In Chinese Buddhist sutras there are examples of transcription such as Daenna and Jiana.
The word 'Dhyāna' means mediation in modern Japanese.
In addition, the word 'yoga' is also translated into mediation in modern Japanese, but it originally means to control mind and leads it to integration.
Although the action of mediation can be represented by words, mediation is clearly different from Zen and distinguished basically because Zen adopts furyumonji.
This confusion of mediation and Zen is caused by translations into a language which has less vocabulary, such as English.
In China, the word Dhyana (Meditation, 禅定) has the same meaning.
The word 'Samādhi' in Sanskrit shows a similar idea.
The word 'Zen' or 'Jo' was originated from India and its experience of mediation had an important meaning after the establishment of Buddhism.
Gotama Siddhattha was also considered to reach enlightenment through Dhyana (Meditation), and it had been thought to be important for ascetic practices of Buddhism as one of the 'San-gaku' (indispensable three practices when learning the teachings of the Buddha) (commandment, jo and wisdom) in Hynayana Buddhism and as one of the Rokuharamitsu (Charity, Morality, Endurance, Diligence, Mediation and Wisdom) in Mahayana Buddhism.
The Zen in China
It is described in the literature on Chinese Zen, such as "Keitoku Dento Roku" (books of the genealogy of Zen Buddhism, consisting of biographies of priests in India and China) as follows.
It insists that Buddhism was gradually transmitted from Mahakasyapa and the teaching of Zen was introduced by Bodhidharma from India to China, which authorized the Zen in China.
Mahakasyapa was a disciple from Brahman society and regarded as a hoshi (successor of Buddhism) of Shakyamuni, and his legend called nenge misho (heart-to-heart communication (literally, "holding a flower and subtly smiling")) is seen in "Mumonkan" (The Gateless Gate), books of the Zen sect in Sung.
The Zen in China was established as the Zen sect after Shiso Doshin (the fourth leader Doshin) (580 - 651) and Goso Konin (the fifth leader Konin) (601 - 674) who were called Tozanhomon (a group in Chinese Zen Buddhism).
In addition, it is thought that it was developed after a new definition of mediation and Dhyana (Meditation) were shown in the "Rokusodaishi Hobodangyo" (also known as Rokuso Dankyo, the platform sutra of the sixth patriarch) which included the name of Rokuso Eno (the sixth leader Eno) (638 - 713) and was thought to be edited by his disciple Kataku Jinne.
In addition, the episode Nangaku Ejo (677 - 744), a disciple of Eno, and his disciple Baso Doitsu (709 - 788) in "Keitoku Dento Roku" (Transmission of the Lamp) made the position of the Zen sect against mediation clear.
The essence of the Chinese Zen sect is shown clearly in this part, which was greatly beyond traditional mediation in Buddhism.
On the other hand, it is not without reason that some people criticize the Zen sect to defame the teachings of Shakyamuni.
However, this is a sincere Buddhism which sought the practice of Hannya-haramitsu (completion of the supreme wisdom) from the foundation behind thought, and it is true that the Zen sect flourished from Tang to Sung.
The word 'Hannya-haramitsu' refers to the transcendence of wisdom of dichotomy between the two such as shigan (this world) and higan (that world), but it does not refer to the transcendence by mediation, and the Chinese Zen masters aimed to return to the position where there was no mind, that is, the position before ideas occurred.
Therefore, the record of conversation in such activities (Zengoroku) is nonsense from the viewpoint of daily logos.
In China, it seems that Chinese Zen often exchanged with Taoism founded by Lao-tze, so that there are many common points between them.
As opposed to traditional Chinese Buddhism, which was centered around knowledge, Zen developed greatly in China as Buddhism which aimed at prompt enlightenment instead of gradual enlightenment through knowledge and mediation.
In addition, the 'Dento,' which was the transmission of enlightenment, was emphasized in the Zen sect and Buddhism had been succeeded from masters to disciples.
Soon in the Northern Sung, the idea of 'five sects' proposed by Hogen Moneki was generalized and established as 'Goke' (five sect).
In addition, the group of Oryo School and Yogi School of the Rinzai sect strengthened the influence to as strong as the 'Goke,' which led to the idea of 'Goke Shichishu' including these two schools.
In addition, Zen was not dominated by the Zen priests.
They actively got engaged in society from the active nature of Zen.
Therefore, it had a wide influence to various cultures such as Confucianism Philosophy including Neo-Confucianism and Yomei-gaku (neo-Confucianism based on teaching of Wang Yangming), literature including Chinese poetry, Sansui-ga (Chinese-style landscape painting) of ink-wash painting and arts including garden making beyond the framework of a religious community.
The founder of the sect was Gigen RINZAI, who lived at the end of Tang.
From the end of the Tang to Godai (Five Dynasties) period, the Rinzai sect, which was based in Northern China, did not have a strong influence after Gigen's disciples Sansei Enen and Koke Zonsho.
Only Nanin Egyo and Fuketsu Ensho of Zonsho lineage partly succeeded its tradition.
In the Northern Sung, when the Zen masters such as Funyo Zensho, Koe Genren (広慧元漣) and Sekimon Unso who were disciples of Shuzan Shonen, a disciple of Ensho, appeared one after another, it came to flourish.
Sekiso Soen and Roya Ekaku (瑯琊慧覚) who were Zensho's disciples, and Yogi Hoe of the Yogi school and Oryu Enan of the Oryu school, who were Shonen's disciples, appeared and their group dominated all over China.
Koho Genmyo, who lived in the Yuan Dynasty Period, expressed its character by the words of 'glorious fun.'
The Oryu school
After the middle of the Sung Period, the lineage of Enan expanded its influence to as strong as the Goke with the Yogi school.
The appearance of Maido Soshin, Torin Josho (東林常聡) and Shinjo Katsubun (真浄克文) who were disciples of Enan, Shijin Goshin and Reigen Isei who were disciples of Shoshin, and Tosotsu Juetsu and Kakuhan Keiko (覚範慧洪) who were disciples of Katsubun, led to its flourishing and the Oryu school became superior to the Yogi school, which had flourished more before.
The lineage of Hoe expanded its influence, the same as the Oryu school, and became one of the schools among Shichishu (the Seven schools).
After Goso Hoen, a disciple of Hakun Shutan, the Zen masters such as Engo Kokugon, Bukkan Egon and Butsugen Seion, who were Hoen's disciples, appeared and were called 'the three Buddha.'
In the Southern Sung period, it kept influence and Daie Soko, who was a disciple of Kokugan, had many disciples and established the Daie school.
Besides the Kokyu school of Kukyu Joryu, the Shogen school of Kido Chigu and the Haan school (破庵派) of Bushun Shiban also flourished.
The Igyo sect
It was founded by Izan Reiyu (潙山霊裕) and Gyozan Ejaku.
This lineage also had influence around Jingnan and the Southern Tang, both of the Ten kingdoms, but gradually declined and disappeared before the Sung period.
Koho Genmyo, who lived in the Yuan Dynasty Period, expressed its character by a word of 'sobersides.'
The Unmon sect
It was founded by Unmon Bunen.
Korin Choon, Dosan Shusho and Tokusan Enmitsu, who were disciples of Bunen, formed a large group at the end of the Tang, and flourished from the end of the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Sung period.
In the Sung period, Seccho Juken from the lineage of Choon and Butsunichi Kaisu from the lineage of Monju Oshin (文殊応真) flourished.
A Juken disciple, Tene Gie, appeared and was known as the reviver of the Unmon sect.
After that, the Zen masters such as Butsuin Ryogen (仏印了元) and Daibai Hoei (大梅法英) appeared one after another and it had an influence as strong as the Rinzai sect in the Northern Sung period, but it gradually declined towards the end of the Northern Sung period.
In the Southern Sung period, Raian Shoju, an editor of "Katai Futo Roku" (the Chia-t'ai Comprehensive Record of the Lamp), and others flourished, but it had a small influence and finally disappeared at the end of the Southern Sung period.
Koho Genmyo, who lived in the Yuan Dynasty Period, expressed the tradition of the sect by the words 'noble and archaic.'
It was founded by Tozan Ryokai who lived at the end of Tang.
The lineage of Ryokai and Sozan Honjaku were spread in the Jingnan and Southern Tang, both of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, but did not have a strong influence as a whole.
Only Sozan Eika (曹山慧霞), a disciple of Honjaku, Doan Dohi, a disciple of Ungo Doyo, Gokoku Shucho (護国守澄), a disciple of Sozan Kyonin, and Sekimon Kenun (石門献蘊), a disciple of Seirin Shiken, flourished.
In the northern Sung period, it did not spread so much, but Toshi Gisei revived the sect.
Its sect tradition was succeeded by Fuyo Dokai and Tanka Shijun.
Dokai was rejected from being given a purple Buddhist priest stole and the title of master by the Emperor Kiso and was exiled to Shishu (Shandong Province), which turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the Soto sect to spread in Northern China.
In the Southern Sung period, Wanshi Shogaku and Shinkatsu Seiryo, who were disciples of Shijun, appeared and kept the sect's tradition called 'Mokusho-Zen' (Zen which emphasizes mediation), but it had less influence than the Rinzai sect.
In addition, Nyojo TENDO, a disciple of Seiryo, was a master of Dogen who went to Sung.
Jitoku Keiki (自得慧暉), a disciple of Shogaku, described "Roku Gyu-zu" (a picture of six cows).
The lineage of Keiki had supported the Soto sect after that.
From the lineage of Rokumon Jikaku, which spread in Hebei Province, Bansho Gyoshu appeared in the Jin period and spread it actively.
Gyoshu taught many outstanding disciples such as Rinsen Jurin (林泉従倫), Setsutei Fukuyu and Yaritsu Sozai, and was admired by Shoshu (章宗) (Jin Dynasty).
Fukuyu won in the dispute with Ri Shijo, a Taoist of Quanzhen school of Taoism in the Yuan, and spread it whilst based at the Shorin-ji Temple (Shaolin Temple) in Mt.Sung.
After that, the Shorin-ji Temple was a base of the Soto sect in Northern China, and it began to use the name of 'Soto Sho sect' (Soto legitimate sect) in the latter part of Ming.
Koho Genmyo, who lived in the Yuan Dynasty Period, expressed its character by a word of 'minute.'
The Hogan sect
It was founded by Hogen Moneki who wrote "Shumon Jukki-ron" (The Ten maladies in practicing Zen) which was the origin of the idea of 'Goke.'
In the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the Sen family, a king of Wuyue, guarded the priests of the Hogan sect such as Eimei Dosen (永明道潜), Tendai Tokusho and Eimei Enju, so that it flourished in the Jiangnan district.
In the Sung period, the lineages of Tokusho and Enju declined.
Instead of them, the lineages of Seiryo Taikin and Kisu Gijyu were spread.
Ungo Dosai (雲居道斉) and his disciple Reiin Bunsho (霊隠文勝) of the Taikin lineage flourished, but it gradually declined and disappeared finally at the end of the Northern Sung period.
Koho Genmyo, who lived in the Yuan Dynasty Period, expressed the sect tradition by the words 'clarification in detail.'
Zen in Japan
Zen was officially said to be transmitted in the 13th century (in the Kamakura period), but it had been already introduced in the Heian period and there is a record that Zen was lectured at Danrin-ji Temple.
In addition, Gyohyo in the Provincial Monastery of Omi Province (Kokubun-ji Temple in Omi), a master of Saicho (a founder of the Tendai sect in Japan), succeeded the lineage of the Northern Sung (Baisong) in China.
The lineage of Rinzai Zen began from Eisai who crossed to the Southern Sung of China and brought it back.
The lineage of Soto Zen also began after Dogen crossed to China, certified for enlightenment and came back to Japan, but it is known that Dainichibo Nonin had founded Nihon Daruma sect at Tonomine and that some priests of the Soto sect such as Ekan and Gikai had been originally the priests of Nihon Daruma sect before Dogen.
After the Kamakura period, it had spread mainly among samurai and common people and Zen temples (temples belonging to the Zen sect) were built in various places.
The Rinzai sect
See detail in 'The Rinzai sect in Japan' of 'Rinzai Sect.'
The founder of the sect was Gigen RINZAI who lived in Tang.
In Japan, it began from Eisei who introduced Rinzai Zen from China, and it has many schools because some masters introduced Shingi (daily regulations in Zen temples) of each age from China to Japan.
The present Rinzai sect in Japan is called Koanzen, which was established by Hakuin in the Edo period.
The term 'koan' refers to the reports of judgment, but turned out to be used as the conversation of masters as transmitted as Zengoroku (analects about Zen).
Each example of koan is counted as Issoku (one), Nisoku (two).
Knowing its conversation helps to know the enlightenment.
Many Koan are difficult to understand by logical thinking.
Among the Rinzai sect, the Myoshin-ji Temple school is the largest.
In the Edo period, the study of the sect was developed by Mujaku Dochu (1653 - 1744), who revised many books, established a detailed method and left enormous writings.
His books come up to the standard which is valuable for research even in recent and modern times, and duplicates prepared by using photography are published as books for practical purposes.
The Soto sect
See detail in 'The Soto sect in Japan' of 'Soto sect.'
It began to use the name of the Soto sect since the sixth master Sokei Eno and Tozan Ryokai.
In Japan it was begun by Dogen, who crossed to China, certified for enlightenment and came back to Japan in 1226.
In the following year after coming back, he wrote Fukanzazengi (the first book written by Dogen after coming back to Japan, where the importance of Zen meditation is emphasized) and promoted the tradition of the sect which focused on Shikantaza.
The contents of the ascetic practices are characterized by keeping 'Eihei Shingi' (Eihei Rules of Purity) strictly and devoting oneself to mediation without being satisfied with a temporal Kensho (certification of the properties) or seeking an enlightenment in other practices except mediation.
Dogen insisted that his teaching was the 'Buddhism of Seiden' (a correct record) while denying being seen as a sect, and also disliked to be called the Zen sect.
At first he was eager to spread his teaching to lay believers, but in his later years he took the priests-first (see the 12th volume of Shobogenzo (Treasury of the Eye of True Teaching)).
After that, Keizan, who founded the Soji-ji Temple, gradually incorporated not only mediation but also ceremonies and the idea of Esoteric Buddhism, which led to a rapid expansion all over the country.
It insists that the mediation of the Soto sect does not depend on koan and that devoting oneself to seating (Shikantaza) shows the original self (shushofuji (practice and enlightenment are not separated but combined as if they are one)), but it does not deny koan itself, and some schools actually use koan.
The Fuke sect
It began from Fuke who appeared in the Rinzai Roku (the record of Rinzai's teachings) in the ninth century.
There are few records on Fuke.
He was famous as a komuso (begging Zen priest of the Fuke sect) traveling while playing a kyotaku (shakuhachi bamboo flute).
It was introduced to Japan after Shinchi Kakushin, who had crossed to China from Japan, became a disciple of Son Chosan (孫張参), the 16th head priest of the Chinese Fuke sect, and came back to Japan in 1254.
The head temple was the Ichigetsu-dera Temple (present Matsudo City, Chiba Prefecture).
In the Edo period, it was organized by bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), but it was dissolved by the Meiji Government in 1871 because it had strong ties with the Edo bakufu.
It disappeared as a sect and was incorporated into the Rinzai sect (in addition, the Ichigetsu-dera Temple belongs to the present Nichiren Sho Sect).
However, its tradition remains in the lineage of masters of shakuhachi bamboo flute or kyotaku flute.
The Obaku sect
It began from the Zen master Ingen Ryuki (Yinyuan Longqi) of the Rinzai sect in China who was invited from Ming in 1654 (in the Edo period).
He tried to identify the sect as Rinzai Shin sect, but was not allowed by bakufu, so it is called the Obaku school of the Rinzai sect, and was named after Kiun OBAKU, a master of the Rinzai sect.
It was characterized by nenbutsu-zen which combined Zen of the Ming style and nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation), and was known by its sutra chanting being Bonbai (a song in Indian style) in the Ming style using music instruments.
In addition, it not only placed Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) at the Manpuku-ji Temple in 1663 but also held the meetings of Jukai (handing down the precepts) in various places, which had an impact on the revival movement of commandments in the Edo period.
During the Edo period, it was not considered as one sect but seen as one school of the Rinzai sect.
It was in 1876 after the Meiji Restoration when it identified itself as the Obaku sect and achieved independence from the Rinzai sect, and it became one of the Zen sects after the Meiji period.
The Zen Buddhism in the world
Zen has spread from Japan to other countries, and Japanese Zen is mostly known in the world.
Zen was introduced by Daisetsu SUZUKI, a Japanese scholar who was said to reach enlightenment, to the United States and Europe in the 20th century, and was spread by Taisen DESHIMARU of the Soto sect in Europe.
At present in the 21st century, both the Rinzai sect and the Soto sect have temples in the United States and Europe.
Horin (法輪) (Sanskrit: dharma-chakra, pinyin: falun) is another name for the creed of Buddhism, especially the Four Axioms Noble and the Eightfold Path taught by Buddha.
"Rin" (輪) means chakram, a throwing weapon in ancient India.
It is an expression of the way of destroying one's Bonno (earthly desires) by believing in the creed of Buddhism taught by priests compared to the chakram, which is one of seven treasures of Tenrinjoo (universal ruler), emphasizing an aspect of destroying evil.
From this, to transfer (転: ten) the creed (法輪: horin) is referred to as tenporin in Buddhism, and, particularly, an event in which Buddha taught the creed to his five ex-ascetic fellows in Sarnath for the first time is referred to as shotenporin.
After that, Horin was embodied as a hogu (ritual implement) in the shape of a wheel that spreads the creed in every direction indicative of the creed of Buddhism, worshipped as a symbol of Buddhism along with the Buddhist cross, and used as a decoration on the roofs of temples and shrines.
Horin is also taken into Taoism in China, and used as a term meaning the creed.
Nichizon (1265 – 1346) was a disciple of Nikko.
Nichizon was a priest of the Nichiren sect during the mid and late Kamakura period.
Nichizon was the fourth leader of the Nichiren-hon sect.
Nichizon was from the Kikegawa family of Oshu (Mutsu Province).
Nichizon was referred to as Tayu Ajari.
He founded Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple.
Nichizon shonin's stool stone (a stone to sit on) is in the temple grounds of Omosu-dansho (Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple).
Striving to develop his disciples at Omosu-dansho, in the fall of 1299 Nikko excommunicated Nichizon who was distracted by the leaves falling from pear trees outside the window during a lecture.
The excommunicated Nichizon allegedly made a commitment to himself to turn over a new leaf and visited various regions, building 36 temples.
Even after being excommunicated Nichizon always made a pilgrimage to Omosu-dansho for the anniversary of the Founder's death (memorial service) every year.
However, as Nichizon was not allowed to enter the main hall, he secretly made his pilgrimage, sitting on a stone outside the gate.
It is said that, lifting Nichizon's anathema later on, Nikko gave him 36 Mandala.
After the passing of Nikko, after accompanying Nichimoku for Tenso (to preach the Buddhism to the Emperor), Nichizon subsequently performed Tenso by the wishes of Nichimoku.
Afterwards, Nichizon was engaged in missionary work in the Kyoto area.
Brief personal history
Nichizon was born in 1265.
He became a priest of the Tendai sect as a child.
In 1283, Nichizon became a disciple of Nichimoku at a station of the lord of a manor at Misako 6-chome in Mutsu Province (at age 19).
In 1284, the third anniversary of the death of Nichiren Daishonin was commemorated.
Nichizon went to Kuon-ji Temple with Nichimoku and became a disciple of Nikko.
In 1290, in conjunction with the construction of Taiseki-ji Temple, Nichizon founded a tacchu (a sub-temple on the premises of a large temple) named Kujo-bo Temple.
In 1299, Nichizon was excommunicated by Nikko at Omosu.
In 1308, Nichizon traveled around Japan, founding Hokkedo (the latter-day Yoho-ji Temple) in Yamashiro in Kyoto.
In the spring of 1333, while traveling with his teacher Nichimoku, who was to preach Buddhism to the Emperor in Kyoto, Nichimoku died in Tarui in Mino Province along the way and, taking over Nichimoku's will, Nichizon entered Kyoto.
In the spring of 1334, Nichizon preached Buddhism to Emperor Godaigo.
In recognition of this service, the Imperial Family made a donation of temple land located at Rokkaku Aburano-koji Street to Nichizon.
In 1336, Nichizon founded Hokkedo (the latter-day Jogyo-in) at Rokkaku Aburano-koji Street.
On October 13, 1342, Nichizon invited his disciple Nichiin over from Jitsujo-ji Temple in Aizu to give him Jogyo-in.
On May 8, 1346, Tayu Anichizon, the founder of Jogyo-in at Rokkaku in Kyoto (the fourth head priest of Yoho-ji Temple in Kyoto) died (at age 81).
Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect) is a post that serves as the resident priest of Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei, the head temple of the Tendai sect, exercising general supervision over all of its sub-temples.
Tendai-zasu was also referred to as the 'Head Priest of the Mountain.'
The Tendai-zasu, however, rarely lived at Mt. Hiei and many of them went to that mountain only on occasions when important services and ceremonies were held.
In 824, Gishin was referred to as Tendai-zasu for the first time.
Up to the time of the second head priest Encho, the term Tendai-zasu was a private title used within the compound of Enryaku-ji Temple but, starting with the third head priest Ennin, it became an official post appointed by way of kanpu (official documents from the Dajokan or Grand Council of State) issued by the Dajokan, and which continued until 1871.
There have been numerous occasions when the same person received the appointment more than once, with, for example, Jien and Cloistered Imperial Prince Sonen assuming the post of Tendai-zasu 3 and 4 times respectively.
In the early Middle Ages, with the Sekke-monzeki (temples headed by regents) and miya-monzeki (temples headed by imperial princes) systems being in place, cloistered imperial princes from Myoho-in Temple, Joren-in Temple and Sanzen-in Temple (the Tendai Three Monzeki) in particular began to assume the position of Tendai-zasu frequently.
Additionally, during the Muromachi period, the post of Tendai-zasu was filled by members of the Ashikaga Shogun family.
There are some examples of Tendai-zasu who subsequently returned to secular life to become Seii taishogun (literally, the great general who subdues barbarians) including Imperial Prince Morinaga (his secular name after leaving the priesthood) and Yoshinori ASHIKAGA (also his secular name after leaving the priesthood).
In the Edo period, the grand temples of the Tendai sect in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), Rinno-ji Temple on Mt. Nikko in Nikko and Kanei-ji Temple on Mt. Toei (Tenkai was the founder and the first chief priest) in Ueno were built by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Rinno-ji Temple was designated as a temple headed by imperial princes (referred to as Rinnojinomiya or Nikko-monzeki), and it was settled that after 1656 Rinnojinomiya had responsibilities both as the resident priest of Toeizan and Tendai-zasu, being responsible for general supervision of the three temples of the Tendai sect above (.Sanzan Kanryo no miya).
In 1871 the designation of the Tendai-zasu was repealed by the Dajokan (Grand Council of State) and the position of Tendai-zasu disappeared, but following the many calls for its restoration both from within the Tendai sect and without, in 1885 it was revived in the form of a private title.
Kojun HANDA is the current and the 256th Tendai-zasu.
Various records including the appointment log of the successive zasu, services, events and incidents are documented in 'Tendai-zasu ki' (Archives of Tendai-zasu).
Kankyo no Tomo is a collection of Buddhist tales written in kana in the early Kamakura period.
There is a note saying, 'Hosshinshu (Tales of Awakening) is a good go-between between a true friend and one in a cloistered life' which the term Kankyo no Tomo is considered to have originated from.
It came into existence in Spring of 1222.
Kankyo no Tomo consists of 32 tales in 2 volumes, and is compiled from stories that were not included in the preceding collection of Buddhist tales.
It was a book written to show a certain noble lady an ideal way for seeking spiritual truth.
The author said that the purpose of this book was to correct one's failings and to develop and complement thought, being aware of the lessons of the preceding "Hosshinshu" (Tales of Awakening).
While it had been said since ancient times that Jien was the author, research has revealed that it was not Jichin (also known as Jien) but a Tendai sect priest Sogetsubo Keisei who was the grandchild of Jien's older brother.
Keisei was a person of talent being an accomplished waka poet as well as the writer of numerous books.
In addition to his early work "Kankyo no Tomo," it is said that a collection of anecdotes entitled "Hirasan Kojin Rei Taku" (The Entrusted Soul of the Ancient Man in Mt. Hira) was also written by Keisei.
Born the child of Sessho (Regent) Yoshitsune KUJO and the older brother of Kanpaku (Chief Advisor to the Emperor) Michiie KUJO, it was said that Keisei became physically disabled due to a childhood accident and subsequently entered the priesthood at Enjo-ji Temple.
After studying esoteric Buddhism at To-ji Temple, Keisei visited the Southern Sung Dynasty in 1217 and returned home in the following year.
Keisei set up Hokkesan-ji Temple where he lived in Matsuo in the western outskirts of the capital Kyoto, forming a close friendship with Myoe of Kozan-ji Temple.
Beginning with the story of the Cloistered Imperial Prince Shinnyo on his Gudo (seeking for the teachings of Buddha) expedition in India, the 21 anecdotes in "Kankyo no Tomo" Volume 1, describe the religious life of various famous and anonymous saints including the anecdotes of high-ranking priests such as Zenshu (Zenju), Genpin (Genbin) and Kuya, whereas many of the 11 stories in Volume 2 relate anecdotes concerning women such as Kenreimonin.
Although identifying with those living in seclusion the author doesn't show a pessimistic view of life.
Keisei's strength in this area seems to have stemmed from his own misfortune.
Additionally, Keisei's interest in death and uncleanliness can be identified.
An ancient copy of Kankyo no Tomo has been passed down through the generations and still remains in existence at Sonkeikaku-bunko (a library of the Kaga Maeda family) today.
Kankyo no Tomo is included in Shin Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei (New Japanese Classic Literature Outline).
The Hokke mandala (Lotus Mandala) is one of the mandala that represent the world of Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra) with illustrations, Sanskrit and kanji.
The Hokke Mandala of Esoteric Buddhism
The Hokke mandala of the Shingon and Tendai sects depicted Bodhisattva, who appears in the first 14 chapters of the Lotus Sutra (also known as Shakumon).
There was tahoto pagoda (two-storey pagoda with a square base, pent roof and a round top) in the center, Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni) on the center right, Taho Nyorai (Buddha of Many Treasures who depicted in the Lotus Sutra) on center left, and the surrounding area had Miroko Bosatsu (Buddha of the Future, Bodhisattva of the Present), Monju Bosatsu (Manjusri Bodhisattva associated with wisdom, doctrine and awareness), Yakuo Bosatsu (Bodhisattva who represents healing), Myoon Bosatsu, (Bodhisattva of music), Joshojin Bosatsu (Bodhisattva Nityodyukta, literally, ever-vigorous), Mujini Bosatsu (Bodhisattva who have strong never-ending will to save all living things), Kannon Bosatsu (Bodhisattva of Mercy) and Fugen Bosatsu (Samantabhadra Bodhisattva).
The Hokke Mandala of Nichiren
The Hokke mandala of Nichiren disciples expressed Nyorai (Tathagata), Bosatsu (Bodhisattva), Myoo (Wisdom King) and Tenbu (deities that reside in a heavenly realm, one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another), which appear in the last 14 chapters of the Lotus Sutra (also known as Honmon) to which Nichiren must respond at the end of the world.
It was first written in 1271, and there were 127 books written directly by Nichiren (among which were 30 principle images of the Nichiren Sho Sect); these are in existence today.
There is a Nichiren chant in the center (Namu Myoho Renge-kyo Sutra (Devotion to the Law of Lotus Sutra)).
There are Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni), Jogyo Bosatsu (Pure Practice Bodhisattva), Anryugyo Bosatsu (Firm Practice Bodhisattva), Fugen Bosatsu, Miroko Bosatsu, Daikasho (Mahakasyapa), Shakudai Kanin Daio (many of the principle images of the Nichiren Sho Sect after the end of the Edo period expressed it as Taishakuten-o), Daigetsu Daio (literally, great moon king), Myojo Tenshi (literally, son of heaven in morning star), Ju-rasetsunyo (ten demonesses), Ajase-o (A king of Magadha in India in the time of Shakyamuni Buddha), Dairyuo (Great Dragon King), Myoraku Daishi (daishi refers literally a great master, an honorific title given by the Imperial Court), Denkyo Daishi, Hachiman Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva Hachiman) and Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja) located on the left.
There are Taho Nyorai (prabhuta-ratnam in Sanskrit), Jogyo Bosatsu (Superior Practice Bodhisattva), Muhengyo Bosatsu (Limitless Practice Bodhisattva), Monju Bosatsu, Yakuo Bosatsu, Sharihotsu (One of Shakyamuni Buddha's ten major disciples, known as foremost in wisdom), Daibonteno (a king of the First Meditation Heaven in the world of form where King Mahabrahma lives), Dairokuten Mao (Big Number Six Heavenly Deity), Dainichiten-o (literally, a king of Great Sun heaven), Kishimojin (Goddess of Children), Tenrinjo-o (literally, Wheel-turning-holy-king), Ashura-o (Ashura King), Devadatta, Ryuju Bosatsu (literally, Dragon Tree Bodhisattva), Tendai Daishi, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Fudo Myoo (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) located on the right.
(This varies according to its width.)
There are Jikokuten (Dhrtarastra) on the upper right, Komokuten (Virupaksa) on the lower right, Zochoten (Virudhaka) on the bottom left and Bishamonten (Vaisravana) on the upper left.
It is called the Hige mandala (beard mandala) from its characteristic of expressing these in Kanji and Sanskrit as well as the long lines drawn from the chant, which is located in the center.
The 'Doshi Honzon' (principle image of priest, which is placed in a ossuary of temples) used in the Nichiren Sho Sect funeral have 'Enma Hoo' (the judge at the gate of Hell) instead of 'Amaterasu Omikami' and 'Godo Myokan' (Officers of the Hell of five posthumous worlds) instead of 'Hachiman Daibosatsu.'
Seicho no Ie Uji Bekkaku Honzan is the bekkaku honzan (special head temple) of Seicho no Ie, which is centered around Hozo-jinja Shrine in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture.
The temple was built in 1960.
The enshrined deities of Hozo-jinja Shrine are the Great God of Seicho no Ie, Okuni nushi no okami (Great God of the earth), Kanzeon Bosatsu (the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy), Jizo Dai Bosatsu (Great Jizo Bodhisattva; Guardian Deity of Children) and Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata).
It is known within the religious group as the place in which to hold memorial services for spirits such as ancestors, eitaikuyo (services held on the anniversaries of the dead who were for long periods in charge of a temple, and other occasions), and unborn babies due to miscarriage.
Once the perpetual religious service was held, he or she was worshipped as Reigu Seishimei Bosatsu.
It's one of the facilities in which Shinyu Kigan (prayer to God for healing) was held.
The monthly 'Hozo (Treasure House)' is published with the life-experience stories of several dozen people.
The Saint Sutra of 'Kanro no Hou' is read aloud each day.
Uji-jinja Shrine, Uji kami-jinja Shrine and Kosho-ji Temple are located opposite the Uji-gawa River.
The region here was once called Nansebo and is where 'Anyoshu,' which stored the treasures of Byodo-in Temple, was present.
Seicho no Ie Sohonzan' Ryugu Sumiyoshi Hongu Shrine in Saikai City, Nagasaki Prefecture, is the grand head temple, as distinguished from bekkaku honzan.
There is also the Hozo-jinja Shrine in Brazil (completed in 1957).
Main Festivals
Reigu Seishimei Bosatsu and Reigu Seishimei Kaiin Shotsuki Meinichi Kuyosai (the anniversaries of one's death after the first anniversary of members of Reigu Seishimei)
Hozo-jinja Getsujisai (monthly mass) and Zenkoku ryuzanji muenrei kuyotokuyo Getsujisai (monthly mass for aborted fetuses)
Suekazu Inari-jinja Shrine Getsujisai (monthly mass of Suekazu Inari-jinja Shrine) and Seirei Shokon-jinja Shrine Getsujisai (monthly mass of Seirei Shokon-jinja Shrine)
Garanjin is a deity that guards temples and shrines.
It is also referred to as Gogaranjin, Shugogaranjin, and Jishin.
A hall in which Garanjin is enshrined is referred to as Garan-do.
In terms of guarding Garan (Buddhist temples), Chinju (local Shinto deity) can be also considered one of the Garanjin, but 'Garanjin' generally refers to a statue in the shape of a Taoism deity enshrined in a Buddhist sanctum of a temple of the Zen sect or the like.
In Japan, influenced by Buddhism in the Sung period, China, this type of statue started to be produced and enshrined in the mid Kamakura period.
In temples in China (Sung), the Taoism deities were enshrined in Dojido (hall of the guardian deity), and it was conveyed to Japan.
In addition to temples of the Zen sect, Garanjin is enshrined in temples and shrines greatly influenced by Sung Buddhism, such as Senyu-ji Temple of the Shingon sect (Kyoto City) and its branch temple, Kakuon-ji Temple.
In many cases, several Garanjin are enshrined together in a corner of a Buddhist sanctum or the like.
Many of the statues are standing or sitting in various clothes and poses with various expressions, and many of them wear a Chinese Taoism costume and a crown.
Nyujo is one of the ultimate ascetic practices of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism.
It is a means by which a priest can save all creatures until the advent of Maitreya beyond the border of life and death.
His body will appear later as sokushinbutsu (Buddhist monks or priests who allegedly caused their own deaths in a way that resulted in their being mummified).
Nyujo was prohibited by law in the Meiji period.
Because it takes many years after Nyujo until the body gets completely mummified as the sokushinbutsu, it is believed that many sokushinbutsu still remain buried underground.
Perform Mokujiki practice (fasting) first.
Control the body so as not to rot after death.
Stop eating grains such as rice and wheat, and manage to survive on water and nuts.
Dochu nyujo (contemplation under the ground) is performed next.
Provide a rock chamber under the ground, and enter it.
Completely bury the rock chamber except for a vent made of a bamboo tube.
The priest rings a bell and chants sutra without eating in the rock chamber, but no sound can be heard in time, and it is believed he will appear after a very long time.
Dainenbutsu kyogen, a silent play created from the teachings of the Yuzu Nenbutsu (reciting the name of Amida Buddha) sect (also known as Dainenbutsu), was revived by Enkaku Shonin.
Yuzu Nenbutsu was started by Ryonin (also known as Shoo Daishi) and is a Nenbutsu Kyogen (Japanese play) created to spread its teachings, with Dainenbutsu-ji Temple (Hirano-ku Ward, Osaka City) in Settsu Province serving as a base.
Yuzu Nenbutsu became popular in the Seiryo-ji and Mibu-dera temples in Kyoto, and Dainenbutsu Kyogen of Enkaku Shonin was passed down at Mibu-dera Temple, Seiryo-ji Temple, Senbon Enmado and Shinsenen.
Honmon Butsuryu Sect was the new religious sect of the school of the Hokke sect; it was founded by Seifu NAGAMATSU, who was of a school of Nichiren, and worshiped Nichiren as the origin of the sect.
Founder
Seifu NAGAMATSU
Seifu NAGAMATSU (also known as Nissen), who had been skeptical about his life, embraced the Honmon (main school) of the Lotus Sutra and became a Buddhist monk but didn't satisfied only by it; subsequently, in 1857 at 41 years of age he took an independent path by opening the doors of Honmon Butsuryu ko association, which stressed Zaike shugi (lay people doctrine) in Takoyakushi, Kyoto.
The teachings of Seifu (Nissen) were that it was important to see the benefit of intonation of the Nichiren chant of Namu Myohorenge-kyo Sutra and that it stressed the spiritual (material) benefit gained in this world through the observance of the Buddhist teachings as seen through the eyes.
The Zaike shugi, having found no acceptance by temples and monks, led to frequent slander from monks of the league of existing temples in regard to his temple, and Seifu (Nissen) was suppressed by being arrested twice along with his disciples and was stopped from going afar; however, in 1878 he increased the size of his sect to one having '30 groups of Karaku (Kyoto) butsuryu-ko and about 10,000 people.'
Consequently, there was ongoing friction with the doctrine of the Honmon Hokke sect; in 1869 he took leave of Honno-ji Temple, which he made the headquarters of his activities, and turned Yusei-ji Temple into his new base.
After Seifu (Nissen) passed away, there occurred the continuous branching of schools and desertion from various debates concerning the problem of localization between the Zaike dogma and monks and the emphasis of the Genseriyaku (spiritual (material) benefit gained in this world through observance of the Buddhist teachings) (division of schools and influence).
It became Honmon Butsuryu Sect in 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, when it attained independence from the Honmon Hokke Sect.
Honzan (Head Temple)
Yusei-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture)
There were the historical temples of Tanjo-ji (Kyoto City), Chosho-ji (Kyoto City), Butsuryu-ji (Otsu City) and Giten-ji (Moriguchi City).
Creed
Zaike Bukkyo shugi
The original Honmon Butsuryu Ko association was the individual Zaike (lay believers) taking the lead in actual missionary work, practice and the way of Buddha teaching humankind, as lectured by Nichiren.
Although there was the presence of a monk as the leading teacher, the main part of the activity was the Ko (association) formed by the gathering of believers of Zaike, which emphasized the connection between the leading lecturer and the disciple.
The degree of leading and monitoring the activities eventually increased, but even today the role of the Ko remains strong.
Genseriyaku and Attacks from Other Sects
Its preaching emphasized the Genseriyaku as proof of the right religion, and strongly criticized other sects and religious groups.
Butsuryu Sect was the one that first carried out the abandonment of charms, notes or statues of different sects or religions, and the exorcism of Hobo (the greatest punishment in Buddhism); thus its missionary methods became a reason to trigger the Otsu Attacks in the early years of Meiji.
Gokyoka (Religious Song)
In order to make the Buddha teachings comprehensible by anyone, it used Gokyoka, which incorporated the Buddhist creed into waka (Japanese poems) and is very easy to understand even in the present day.
Thanks to the paintings and writings the Sanpitsu (three great calligraphers) of the end of Edo period, his name was published in the Heian Jinbutsushi (Record of Heian Notables) and Saikyo Jinbutsushi (Record of Saikyo (Kyoto) Notables); moreover, Masakaze TAKASAKI introduced a poem by Seifu as a great poem to Emperor Meiji, and the messenger was sent to Seifu stating that the Emperor Meiji greatly praised his song, and even kuge (court noble) such as Sanetomi SANJO (other than Emperor Meiji) desired the tanzaku (a long, narrow card on which Japanese poetry is written vertically) of Seifu.
He can be described as an excellent man of culture who represented the period from the end of the Edo to the Meiji period.
The Example of Gokyoka
Even with that knowledge, one is probably an academic who cannot become Buddha, but with one word of shin (believe) one of ignorance can achieve nirvana.
Don't think that the one that wears robe, with rounded head, deceives people, and lives in a temple is a monk
Without seeing the benefit of Gensho, let us look at the evil and good of codes
And so on.
Branch Schools and Influence
After the death of Seifu there were many debates concerning the interference by monks due to the management of Ko and Genseriyaku, and this gave birth to branch schools such as Dainihon Shishikukai and Nichiren shugi (doctrine) Butsuryu-ko.
Additionally, its stance regarding the management of the organization, the emphasis on Genseriyaku and attacks on other sects strongly influenced later new sects of the Lotus Sutra, and some went on pilgrimages similar to that of Mitsu MIYAMOTO, who established Myochikai Kyodan from Reiyukai, which was in turn from Butsuryu Ko.
While Kimi KOTANI of Reiyukai didn't have a direct connection to Butsuryu-ko, she had Tsugunari KUBO listen to Gokyoka.
History and Development
1817: Seifu NAGAMATSU was born in Kyoto.
1849: He became a Buddhist monk at Ryusen-ji Temple (Tsui, Minami Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture) of Honmon Butsuryu Sect.
The monk, who was his priestly teacher, was Nichiyo Shonin.
The name he received as a monk was Muton.
1857: He opened the former Honmon Butsuryu-ko within the Honmon Hokke sect.
1869: He received Yusei-ji Temple (Kyoto Prefecture) from the Honmon Hokke sect.
1890: Seifu NAGAMATSU passed away.
1899: The Honmon Hokke Sect granted the posthumous go (Buddhist title) of Nissen Shonin.
1912: Honmon Hokke Sect granted the posthumous title of Nissen Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order).
1947: It became independent from Honmon Hokke Sect and officially renamed itself as the Honmon Butsuryu Sect.
Tendai Jimon Sect is one of the Mahayana Buddhist sects.
Its Konpon kyoten (primal scripture) is the Myohorenge-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra).
Koso (a founder) was the Tendai Daishi Chigi (538 - 597) from the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Sui Dynasty (China), and the founder of a religious sect was the Chisho Daishi Enchin (child of the niece of Kukai Kobo Daishi (a posthumous title of the priest Kukai)) (814 - 891), who had the title of fifth Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect) during the Heian period.
The Sohonzan (the head temple of a Buddhist sect) is Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple) on Mt. Nagara, located in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture.
It is also called the Jimon School of the Tendai Sect.
The Buddhism of Tendai Daishi, who heavily valued the doctrines of the Lotus Sutra, was brought to Japan by Denkyo Daishi Saicho (767 - 822).
This is the Nihon Tendai Sect.
These teachings were divided into two at Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei, which was the head temple of the Nihon Tendai Sect, by two giants of Ennin, namely the third Tendai zasu and Enchin, who was the fifth Tendai zasu.
Mt. Hiei was occupied mainly by the Ennin School, while those of Enchin School left the mountain and entered Mii-dera Temple.
Since then, the Ennin School, which remained on the mountain, was referred to as the Sanmon School, and the Enchin School, which entered Mii-dera Temple, was referred to as the Jimon School.
The Sanmon School stressed multiple-religious learning of the four religious sects of En (teachings of Tendai Sect), Esoteric, Zen and Kai (Commandment) with Engyo (Perfect Teaching) as the center, but Tendai Jimon Sect added the way of asceticism and followed the five Buddhist teachings of En, Esoteric, Zen, Kai and Asceticism.
The doctrine was to pass these Homon (dharma-gate) and head toward 'Ken (exoteric), Esoteric and Ascetic standing trio' and perform 'Jugubodai Gegeshujo' (self-training and seeking Nirvana every day while looking up and converting others to the religion while looking down).
Kakure Nenbutsu (Hidden Buddhist Invocation) refers to the individuals or groups of people who secretly practiced or believed in the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) (Ikko Sect), which was banned by powerful rulers.
The Jodo Shinshu Sect was suppressed in the former Satsuma and Hitoyoshi domains of southern Kyushu for over 300 years, but remnants of these religious practices can still be observed.
Additionally, there were secret religions such as Kayakabe-kyo Religion that syncretized with Shintoism, but this generally refers to the Hongan religious group and those who protected the main teachings of the Jodo Shinshu Sect.
It is believed to be different from Kakushi Nenbutsu (secret Buddhist invocation) of the Tohoku (northeastern Japan) region.
The Jodo Shinshu Sect was first banned by the Hitoyoshi domain in or around 1555.
The Satsuma domain started to ban the sect in 1597.
The reason is believed that they were told of the status of Kaga Ikko ikki Revolt (an uprising by followers of the Ikko Sect in Kaga) and Ishiyama War, and they feared the Ikko Sect.
Thus the ban was in place for more than 300 years.
They confiscated Buddhist monuments and tools from the believers of the Jodo Shinshu Sect and disposed of them by burning.
There is a historic spot left in Yanase, Sagara Village, Kuma District, Kumamoto Prefecture, where the Buddhist monuments and tools were burned.
Torture and Execution
A form of torture called 'Ishidaki' (Cradling Rock) was performed in the Satsuma domain.
They forced the victim to sit upright with legs folded atop a triangular woodcut, and shake his body back and forth after placing 30-kilogram flat stones 30 centimeters wide, a meter long and 10 centimeters thick onto his lap, piled up one by one.
Once there were five stones, the bones of the leg would break, which sometimes led to death.
This torture was performed on Ikko Sect believers as well as Christians and those who had killed their masters.
Additionally, there was a civil punishment where they threw the believer into a waterfall and poked him with bamboo, whereby the person would be held underwater until he drowned.
The 'Yoneyama no kubizuka' (burial mound for heads in Mt. Yone) remains in Kawaramachi Town, Hitoyoshi City, Kumamoto Prefecture.
It has been said to be the kubizuka of a person called Densuke, who had organized the Ko (monk and believer gathering) of the Jodo Shinshu sect.
Densuke was on his way to submit shinokin (money for admission fee) to Hongan-ji Temple in Kyoto from his district but was betrayed and caught; he was beheaded, and his head was displayed at the prison gate.
Washichiro AKIYAMA, who was the favored disciple of Densuke, stole the head and buried it on his land, and this is now said to be his kubizuka.
Haibutsu Kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism) was performed in Satsuma in 1868.
It was extreme to the extent that buildings designated as temples were destroyed or transformed into Shinto shrines.
The banning of the Jodo Shinshu Sect was abolished in 1876, but since the Seinan War started the actual lifting of the ban came later.
It was the same in the former Hitoyoshi domain.
After the actual lifting of the ban on the Jodo Shinshu Sect, Hongan-ji School of Jodo Shinshu Sect propagated rapidly and Kagoshima Prefecture became filled with followers of Jodo Shinshu Sect as a result.
However, there were various aspects of discord within the network, chiefly between the temples managed by the head temple, which was formed after the ban was lifted, and Kakure Nenbutsu.
The Jodo Shinshu Sect had maintained a systematic network called 'Ko' since the time of Rennyo.
There was a system of Ko that supported the 'Kakure Nenbutsu' belief, which had been practiced in the underground for 300 years.
Ko was systemized as the leader called 'Banyaku' (the role of a guard) without respect for the social class, and was connected to the head temple of Hongan-ji Temple through 'Toritsugiyaku' (the role of a negotiator).
The believers of the Jodo Shinshu Sect performed gatherings called Hoza in caves within the mountain with this kind of Ko organization.
After World War II, this cave became known as Kakure Nenbutsu-do.
Additionally, there were activities called Nukemairi (escape and worship) that involved traveling across the domain border to visit the Jodo Shinshu Sect's temple of the domain, where the religious practices were allowed and performed.
There is Satsuma Beya (the room of Satsuma) left in Genko-ji Temple of Hongan-ji School, the Jodo Shinshu sect in Minamata City, Kumamoto Prefecture.
It was a place of hiding, away from view by society, for the followers of the Ikko Sect who had escaped from Satsuma.
It is known that Christians camouflaged their religious practices such as with the 'Maria' (Virgin Mary) Kannon, but Kakure Nenbutsu also protected their religion with various forms of camouflage.
The wooden standing statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha), portrait of Saint Shinran, and the Six-Name Title (Namu Amidabutsu (a single, sincere call upon the name of Amida)), which were the evidence of the believer of Jodo Shinshu sect, were supposed to be protected while hidden.
Among the various forms of camouflage, there were Kasabotoke (Umbrella Buddha) (the hanging scroll with the portrait of Shinran was stored within a container shaped as an umbrella) and Manaita Hotoke (cutting-board Buddha) (the hanging scroll with the principle image was stored within a thin wooden box shaped like a cutting board).
There were hidden Buddhist altars created in the Kawabe region that looked like chests of drawers (stored in Kagoshima Betsu-in, Higashi Hongan-ji Temple).
They referred to caves as gama (toads) in Kagoshima, and it is said that the characteristic of 'Kakushi butsudan' (hidden Buddhist altar) is strongly left within the gama-shaped Kawabe Butsudan.
Furthermore, there were disciples who cut their ties with the head temple during periods of suppression, such as the Kayakabe-kyo Religion, and went on the independent path by fusing with Shinto and Shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts).
The followers of the Ikko Sect of southern Kyushu didn't resist, acting in a manner similar to the 'Ikki' (uprising) performed by followers of Hokuriku (northern Japan).
Instead, they abandoned the land and escaped in groups as 'Chosan' or 'Kakeochi' (escape and disappear).
Chosan occurred in various areas just to escape the difficulties of life, but in Satsuma it had the purpose of saving the Nenbutsu belief by escaping to the neighboring domain, which permitted the Nenbutsu worship.
There was an incident in 1798 in which 2800 men and women escaped to the estate of the adjacent Obi domain from the estate of the Satsuma domain.
It has been said that the Obi domain, which lacked labor strength, was secretly involved in this.
The Obi domain dealt with escaping farmers by forming the bugyo (magistrate) positions of 'Kakeochi Gyoko' and 'Chosan Gyoko.'
Kazuo INAMORI, who was born in Kagoshima Prefecture and is a chairperson emeritus of Kyocera, described the Kakure Nenbutsu religious practices he experienced when he was a child in his autobiography, 'Ikikata' (The Way of Living).
Great Buddha statue in Kyoto originally existed in Hoko-ji Temple (Higashiyama-ku Ward, Kyoto City).
It was counted as one of the three great statues of Great Buddha in Japan.
The Great Buddha and Daibutsuden (the Great Buddha hall) will be described here.
Construction by Hideyoshi
Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI planned the construction of Daibutsuden and the Great Buddha following the example of Todai-ji Temple of Nara in 1586.
Daibutsuden was mostly completed and approximately 19 meters high wooden Great Buddha statue decorated with lacquer and gold was set up in 1595 but collapsed due to the great earthquake in 1596 before a ceremony to consecrate a newly made Buddhist statue was held.
Hideyoshi passed away in 1598 before a ceremony to consecrate a newly made Buddhist statue, and during the same year the service was held in Daibutsuden without Great Buddha.
The enormous Daibutsuden was approximately 49 meters tall, 88 meters wide south to north and 54 meters deep east to west, and the precincts of the temple included not only Hoko-ji Temple but also Toyokuni-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City) and the Kyoto National Museum.
Construction by Hideyori
Hideyori TOYOTOMI, who was the son of Hideyoshi, succeeded his father and attempted the reconstruction of Great Buddha in copper with Katsumoto KATAGIRI as the leader, but the Buddhist statue melt due to an error by the caster and Daibutsuden was caught in a blaze in December 1602.
(There has also been a theory that it burned down due to arson in 1604.)
There was a plan brought up again to reconstruct Daibutsu and Daibutsuden in November 1608.
The construction of Daibutsuden was begun in 1610; Ieyasu TOKUGAWA ordered the various nearby Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) to support it and sent Masakiyo NAKAI, who was the carpenter, while he himself donated rice.
Furthermore, the golden plate in which the Great Buddha was clad was cast in Edo ("Todaiki" (a famous chronicle describing the Early Modern age)).
The ground-breaking ceremony was performed in July, and the Daibutsuden and the Great Buddha made from copper were completed in 1612.
The bosho (Buddhist temple bell) was completed in Daibutsuden in May 1614, and a rakkei hoyo (a memorial service to celebrate the construction of a temple) was held but was aborted due to an ill-omened word mentioned by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in August concerning the inscription for a Buddhist temple bell drafted by the Zen monk Bunei Seikan of Nanzen-ji Temple.
This was 'the Incident of the Hoko-ji Temple Bell in Osaka no Eki (The Siege of Osaka),' which developed into a conflict between the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa families.
Additionally, the Great Buddha was damaged in the earthquake of 1662 and was thus to be reconstructed with wood.
The copper from the ruined Great Buddha is said to have been used in the casting of Kanei Tsuho (coins).
Lightening struck Daibutsuden in August, 1798.
The main hall, Sanmon, burned down and the wooden Great Buddha was reduced to ashes.
A children's song of Kyoto sings of this fire, 'Great Buddha of Kyoto burned due to the tenka (fire from lightening) and Sanjusangendo Temple left, don-don-don (don-don-yake (a word commonly used by Kyoto citizens for the rapidly spreading fire that started from a fire at the time of the Kinmon Incident)), kora-don-don-don.'
After January 1831
Great Buddha and Daibutsuden of a similar scale haven't been constructed since then, but during 1830 and 1843 a supporter in what is now Aichi Prefecture donated a smaller, former wooden Great Buddha statue from the shoulder up as well as its temporary housing.
However, even this burned down in a midnight fire on March 28, 1973.
The blaze resulted from the left-over fire of a brazier used in the temple building.
Before the fire, there was a year-round exhibition of some remains of Hoko-ji and the Great Buddha.
The Present
Remnants include a belfry where the temple bell that triggered the Shomei Incident, a stone mound and pagoda engraved with various lords, and many facilities with the name 'daibutsu' (Great Buddha) in surrounding areas, such as 'Daibutsumae Police Box' (the police station in front of Great Buddha) on Shichijo-dori and Yamatooji-dori Streets.
Furthermore, the name of Shomen-dori Street (front street), which runs east and west, originated from the street that connects to the 'front' of this Daibutsuden.
Raitei ARIMA (1933 -) is a Zen monk in the present day.
The chief abbot of Shokoku-ji Temple School of the Rinzai sect.
A descendant of the Arima clan, the Lord of the Kurume Domain.
He was born in Tokyo.
He entered the Buddhist priesthood in Gakurin-ji Temple in Hita City, Oita Prefecture at the age of eight.
He practiced asceticism in So-do Hall (a hall for meditation) of Shokoku-ji Temple and the like.
Appointed to current position in 1995.
He serves concurrently as chief priest of Shokoku-ji Temple, Kinkaku-ji Temple (Rokuon-ji Temple), and Ginkaku-ji Temple (Jisho-ji Temple).
He objected to the old capital tax and the verticalization of Kyoto as president of Kyoto Buddhist Association.
Matsuji is a reference to temples under the control of Honzan (head temple), but it had a different purpose when Honmatsu seido (the system of head and branch temples) was established, compared to the present day.
Before the Honmatsu seido was implemented, it was common to follow the sect and the system of teachings of the promoter (the one who had such a wish for a long time), who was the monk that founded or reconstructed the temple; however, there were cases when a powerful temple would suppress the neighboring middle and small temples and became "matsuji."
Additionally, there was shinbutsu shugo (syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism) performed before the Meiji period, and even Shinto shrines were treated as matsuji.
In extreme cases, the temples of different sects were forcibly made into matsuji.
As a result, the relationship between the head temple and matsuji was complicated; there were various relationships that focused on the head temple's finances by making it matsuji in order to contribute a part of its income from shoen (a manor in medieval Japan) and offerings (particularly, it sought donations for temples of different sects and shrines as a matsuji, as insurance to keep its original school and sect), or as a completely systemized relationship.
The Honmatu dispute (dispute over head and branch temples) rose from matsuji seeking its own independence from the head temple by having a great physical distance from the head temple, conflict due to different interests, or by having different sects, and the head-temple side sought to confirm the position and benefits of matsuji.
The most famous one was Enryaku-ji Temple, which collected vast amounts of income from control over Gionsha, Shoren-in Temple in Kyoto City and surrounding areas and sought to further strengthen the base of its power, as derived from finance.
Enryaku-ji Temple occasionally caused Honmatsu disputes; it stressed that Ninnan-ji Temple was matsuji during the Kamakura period ('Gamansho' (a book that advocates orthodox of To-ji Temple's Esoteric Buddhism and counters the misleading view of the followers of Mt. Hiei)) and suppressed Kitano-tenmangu Shrine during Bunan no Koji Sodo (Riot caused by rice malt sellers in the Bunan era) in Muromachi period and Hongan-ji Temple during the Kansei adversity (religious persecution during the Kansei era) to make them accept the matsuji of Enryaku-ji.
Moreover, in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States), it burned down 21 head temples of the Nichiren Sect in Kyoto when they rejected its demand to become its matsuji through the excuse of sect conflict between the followers of the Nichiren Sect and Buddhist monks of Saito (Western Section) of Mt. Hiei (Tenbun Hokke War).
Nevertheless, at the end of the Heian period Kofuku-ji Temple handed a appeal to the Imperial Court to recognize Enryaku-ji Temple as the matsuji.
Other than that, controversies raised involving the Imperial Court and the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), even beyond schools and sects, such as the one claiming by Todai-ji Temple to recognize To-ji Temple and Daigo-ji Temple as its matsuji.
Edo Bakufu established Honmatsu seido and tried to nullify the Honmatsu relationship between different sects in order to prevent massive political and religious conflicts.
Soke SHONAN (year of birth not known (around 1586) - 1637) was a priest of the Myoshin-ji Temple of the Rinzai sect in the Azuchi-Momoyama Period and the Edo Period.
Biography
His childhood name was Hiroi.
His father-in-law was Katsutoyo YAMAUCHI.
His mother-in-law was Kenshoin, Katsutoyo YAMAUCHI's lawful wife.
His real parents are not known.
He was found in front of a monument for the soul of Yone (another story tells it was in front of the house of the Yamauchi family) and brought up like a true son by Katsutoyo and Chiyo (Kenshoin), who were depressed for having lost their only daughter Yone (6 years old) in the earthquake in 1586 in Nagahama, Omi Province.
There is still another story that he was in fact an illegitimate child of Katsutoyo.
However, around 1595, when Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI committed seppuku due to the succession dispute, he left home and became a priest under the order of his father-in-law, Katsutoyo.
Katsutoyo may have thought it would cause a problem in the Yamauchi family if Hiroi, who was out of the bloodline of Yamauchi, took over the family.
Hiroi practiced asceticism in Kyoto to become Soke SHONAN Osho, and at the same time became a chief priest of Gyuko-ji Temple in Tosa Province given by his parents-in-law.
Soke SHONAN was the second chief priest of Myoshin-ji Temple Daitsu-in in Kyoto, and became such a high priest as to receive an imperial sanction for a purple canonical robe from the Imperial Court.
One of his disciples in Myoshin-ji Temple (who also accompanied him to Gyuko-ji Temple in Tosa) was Ansai YAMAZAKI, who later returned to secular life.
Myoshin-ji Temple Daitsu-in later became the family temple of the Yamauchi, and the Kyoto graveyard of Kazutoyo and Kenshoin is also located there.
After the Yamauchi family entered Tosa Province, Soke SHONAN concurrently served as the chief priest of Gyuko-ji Temple in Tosa and the chief priest of Myoshin-ji Temple Daitsu-in, and restored Enmei-ji Temple on Mt. Kotoku in Tosa Province (burnt in the Edo period).
By the way, Katsutoyo adopted Tadayoshi YAMAUCHI, the son of his younger brother Yasutoyo YAMAUCHI, as the successor of the Yamauchi family.
When Kazutoyo died in the fall of 1605, Kenshoin made Yasutoyo the guardian of Tadayoshi, left Tosa in six months, resided near Myoshin-ji Temple where Hiroi lived, and spent the rest of her life in Kyoto.
To Kenshoin, Hiroi was the reincarnation of Yone.
He died in Myoshin-ji Temple in 1637.
His tomb is also in Myoshin-ji Temple.
His homyo (posthumous Buddhist name used in the Shin sect) is 湘南宗化大航普済禅師.

His imina (personal name) was Giso.
His go (priestly name) was Shittashitsu.
He was known as a free-spirited Zen priest, who forced through reforms of the shusei (rules) of Tenryu-ji Temple.
His known disciples include Sogen OMORI, Takayoshi KATO, Seiko HIRATA, and Arakane Tenrin.
Biography
He was from Shimonita-machi, Kanra-gun, Gunma Prefecture.
Inspired by the concept of 'Atarashiki Mura' (new village) propounded by Saneatsu MUSHANOKOJI, he taught young people in 'Ai no Mura' (village of love) at the foot of Mt. Ibuki.
In 1928, he enter the Buddhist priesthood in Zuigan-ji Temple, Gifu Prefecture.
In 1930, he entered Tenryu So-do Hall (A hall for meditation) in Sagano and hung Shakujo (a priest's pewter staff) on a hook on the wall, and succeeded to the teachings of Seki Seisetsu
In 1939, he gained the Shike (Training Master's credentials) of Tenryu So-do-Hall.

In the Meiji period, it was integrated with the Jodo Sect (Chinzei school), but spun off later.
During the World War II, it was integrated with the Nishiyama school, but it has been independent from the postwar period to present.
The Head Temple
Seigan-ji Temple (453 Sakurano-cho, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture)
Gudo Toshoku (May 5, 1577 - November, 1661) was a high Buddhist monk of the Rinzai Sect of Zen sect.
He was the 14th Juji (head priest) of Myoshin-ji Temple of Daihonzan (head temple of a Buddhist sect).
His father was Kinai ITO, and his mother was the daughter of a vassal of the Saito clan.
He was born in Omori, Ijira Village, Mino Province (the present-day Yamagata City, Gifu Prefecture) and became a Buddhist priest when he was 15 years old at Toko-ji Temple (Yamagata City), so as to study under Zuiun.
He went on a pilgrimage to various provinces, in which he visited Motsugai of Kozen-ji Temple in Utsunomiya City and Nanze of Sanyu-ji Temple in Ako City, Harima Province, and studied under Keiyo YOZAN of Shotaku-in Temple of Myoshin-ji Temple before being given the go (Buddhist title) of Gudo and inka (certification of spiritual achievement) (on three later occasions he served Myoshin-ji Temple as Juji (head priest)).
He opened Seiden-ji Temple of Mino Province (Yaotsu City, Gifu Prefecture) and Nakayama-dera Temple of Ise Province (Ise City, Mie Prefecture) in order that the Rinzai Sect might once again flourish.
He also traveled to Edo.
He passed away at 85 years of age at Hokkesan-ji Temple of Yamashina Ward, Kyoto Prefecture.
A year after his death, he was given the posthumous title of kokushi (the most reverend priest) to be called as Daien Hokan Kokushi.
He converted many kuge (court nobles) and buke (samurai families) such as Emperor Gomizunoo, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, Masayuki HOSHINA, Michimura NAKANOIN and KASUGA no Tsubone, into believers.
Musashi MIYAMOTO, in his age of adolescence, also practiced Zen meditation (in the temple) under Gudo in Myoshin-ji Temple.
Kenjo DAITEN (1719 - March 22, 1801), a Zen Buddhist monk and a Chinese-style poet, lived from the middle to late Edo period.
The friendly relationship between Daiten and Koyugai (also known as Baisao) was famous, and he wrote "Baisaoden" (The Story of Baisao).
He was also known as the supporter of Jakuchu ITO.
He elevated Chinese-style poetry and was praised as the best priest poet in Kyoto Zenrin (Zen temples).
During his lifetime he wrote a vast amount of writings, comprising more than 70 books.
He was the highest monk of the Zen sect and was the 113th head priest of Shokoku-ji Temple.
His imina (personal name) was Kenjo.
Daiten was his go (title), and he was called Daiten Zenshi.
He called himself Baisho within the religious sect, but was eventually changed to call himself Shochu.
He also had other go of Atami (since he originated from Omi) and Shounsei, Hokuzen Shoin, Toko Sanjin, Fusho Shujin and Taishin, from the name of his residential area.
Additionally, he was referred to as Jikujo but was 'Shaku (Ken) jo,' so it wasn't that he had two imina.
His original surname was Imahori, and his first name was Taichiro.
He was born as the child of Toan IMAHORI, who practiced Confucianism and medicine, in Iba-go, Kanzaki District, Omi Province, (the present-day Higashiomi City, Shiga Prefecture) but he was mostly likely the illegitimate child of Motokatsu SONO of Gon Dainagon (provisional major counselor) and was later sent for adoption.
He arrived to Kyoto with his father when he was eight years old and entered Kezo-in Temple on Mt. Obaku first but switched to Rinzai Sect to begin his training as a monk in Jiun-an in Sokoku-ji Temple when he was 11 years old.
He studied a type of Confucianism called kobunjigaku, (study of ancient rhetoric school), and he trained in Zen Buddhism under Meika UNO and Daicho Genko up to the end of his twenties while training for Zen under Dokusho Jishu.
He edited and published the posthumous manuscripts of his Confucian master Meika, as "Meika Sensei Ikoshu" (Collection of Posthumous Manuscripts of Teacher Meika) three years after his master passed away, and this showed how deeply he was trusted by his master.
There was Hokkai KATAYAMA among the sworn friends of the disciples of Meika, and he participated in Konton-shisha (Chinese poetry club) arranged by him and demonstrated his profound skills as a poet.
He was assigned the Juji (chief priest) position when he was 32 years old, but with the excuse of illness he asked to refrain from the top position when his master Doppo passed away.
It is believed that he sought literary reclusion in his wish to pursue culture.
After he published his representative work, "Sakuhishu" (Collection of the Mistakes of Yesterday) when he was 43 years old, he engaged himself fully in the creation and writing of poetry.
He associated with many writers and artists, and among them he built lifelong friendships, particularly with Jishu.
There was an episode in which, when a highly valued Buddhist scripture disappeared in China, Daiten and Jishu donated this gift.
He also supported Jakuchu ITO, who was a uniquely talented artist, and had him paint Fusuma-e (images drawn on fusuma sliding doors) for Shokoku-ji Temple.
He also worked to spread Senchado (green tea ceremony) as one who understood Baisao, and wrote "Chakyo Hyosetsu" (comment on Chakyo, a Chinese book about tea).
Additionally, he collaborated with Kenkado KIMURA and published "Sencha ketsu" (secrets of steeped tea) in Qing, whereupon he introduced it to Japan.
He composed 'Baisaoden' (the preface of "Baisao Gego" (Verses and Prose by the Old Tea Seller)), which was the only biography concerning the life of Baisao; the story was thus handed down to succeeding generations.
He was also the master of poetry for Taiga IKENO and had an association with Chazan KAN, Fuyo KO, Shikin KATSU and Santo SHINOZAKI.
When he returned to his own temple at 53 years of age, he was given the Juji position in Shokoku-ji Temple and was additionally assigned to be a great scholar of Kyoto Gozan (Five Great zen Temples of Kyoto) and negotiator with Korea.
At the age of 62, he left for the new position of Juji of Itei-an Temple, Tsushima (province) for a period of two years.
After he returned to his own temple, he became the Juji of Nanzen-ji Temple and traveled to Edo in order to appreciate and worship the leader, as ordered by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (in 1785).
He was favored by Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA and was again invited to Edo.
At that time he drafted a manuscript for a diplomatic document concerning the Buddhist missionary to Korea, and later he participated as the advisor to the bakufu concerning diplomatic relations with Korea.
Shokoku-ji Temple was also completely destroyed in Great Fire of Tenmei (in 1789), and energetically he worked to re-collect and reconstruct valuable books.
He passed away in 1801.
He was 83 at the time of his death.
Poetry
His poetic style followed the Kobunji School, but his education in waka (Japanese poetry) was vast and he attempted to incorporate its elements into Chinese-style poems.
His poetic style was daring in that it transcended the boundaries of Buddhism.
A prolific writer, he published numerous collections of poetry.
