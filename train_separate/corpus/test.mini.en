Known as Sesshu (1420 - 1506), he was an ink painter and Zen monk active in the Muromachi period in the latter half of the 15th century, and was called a master painter.
He revolutionized the Japanese ink painting.
He was given the posthumous name "Toyo" or "Sesshu (拙宗)."
Born in Bicchu Province, he moved to Suo Province after entering SShokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto.
Later he accompanied a mission to Ming Dynasty China and learned Chinese ink painting.
His works were many, including not only Chinese-style landscape paintings, but also portraits and pictures of flowers and birds.
His bold compositions and strong brush strokes constituted an extremely distinctive style.
6 of his extant works are designated national treasures. Indeed, he is considered to be extraordinary among Japanese painters.
For this reason, there are a great many artworks that are attributed to him, such as folding screens with pictures of flowers and that birds are painted on them.
There are many works that even experts cannot agree if they are really his work or not.
Representative works include: Long Landscape Scroll, Summer and Winter Landscape, View of Amanohashidate, Broken Ink Landscape, Portrait of Ekadanpi, Fall and Winter Landscape, and Folding Screen of Birds and Flowers of the 4 Seasons.
His disciples include Shugetsu, Soen, and Toshun.
He was born in Akahama, Bicchu Province (present-day Soja City, Okayama Prefecture), in 1420.
He was born to a Samurai family called ODA.
He entered nearby Hofuku-ji Temple (Soja City) while young.
He moved to Kyoto's Shokoku-ji Temple at the age of around 10, and while studying and having Zen training under Shuto SHUNRIN, learned painting from Shubun TENSHO.
In around 1454, he moved to Suo Province, and built his studio, Unkokuan (Yamaguchi City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), with the patronage of the feudal lord, Ouchi.
In around 1465, he acquired a calligraphy work by Bonki SOSEKI on which the characters of Sesshu were written, and requested Shinkei RYUKO to write a certificate about the origin of the name, Sesshu.
It is believed that after that, he came to be known as Sesshuu.
It is thought that until this time he was known as Touyou SESSHU, but there is not a firm source to indicate that SESSHU and Sesshu were the same person.
In 1468, he sailed to Ming Dynasty China with a mission.
He familiarized himself with authentic Chinese ink painting and studied it for about 2 years.
In the fall of 1481, he traveled to Mino Province.
There is no reliable record of the date of his death, but most put it at 1506.
Other records write that he died in 1502.
In addition to the date of his death, there are many other aspects of Sesshu's life that remain unknown.
There is an interesting episode about Sesshu.
A young Sesshu who entered Hofuku-ji Temple only liked pictures and did not want to read sutras; so the monks of the temple tied him to a pillar in the building enshrining a Buddhist statue.
However, when the monks saw that he drew a rat with his tears that fell on the floor by using his big toe, they were impressed so they allowed him to draw pictures.
This is thought to be the most well known story about Sesshu.
The story first appeared in "Honcho Gashi" compiled by Eino KANO (published in 1693, the Edo period).
Sesshu started to be deified in the Edo period.
It is thought to be because the Kano School that ruled painting circles at the time venerated him as a master, and feudal lords wanted to have Sesshu's artwork.
It is said that this is why the number of artworks attributed to Sesshu increased.
Reflecting Sesshu's popularity, a Japanese puppet drama/Kabuki work entitled "The Gion Religious Festival" was created.
The drama was first performed in January 1758.
The scene of Kinkaku-ji Temple, where Sesshu's granddaughter, Yukihime, takes an active role, is famous) and similar works were performed.
Today, Sesshu who gave birth to one of Japanese cultures is a leading historical figure of this country.

Soujun IKKYUU was a Zen monk in the Daitokuji branch of the Rinzai sect, during the Muromachi period.
He is known as a character in stories.
For IKKYUU's Witty Sayings refer to the section on "IKYUU's Sayings" (also some on this page); for the TV cartoon "Ikkyuu-san", refer to the section on "Ikyuu-san".
Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Gokomatsu.
In Kazunaga SUGAWARA's diary, "Higashiboujou Kazunaga Kyouki", he wrote on August 1st of 1494 that "it is said in secret that the monk IKKYUU is a prince, the illegitimate child of Gokomatsu.
Nobody in the world knows this."
According to later historical documents, his childhood name was Sengikumaru.
Called Shuuken for a long time, he also went by Kyouunshi, Katsuro, and Mukei.
Soujun was his Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name), also written as Soujun.
IKKYUU was his Dougou (monk's name).
(Refer to the section on "Kaimyo" for Kaimyo and Dougou.)
He took orders under Shuukan SHOUGE at Kyoto's Ankokuji at the age of 6, and was named Shuuken.
He quickly developed a talent for poetry; and his poems "Choumonshunsou", which he wrote at 13, and "Shunishukka", which he wrote at 15 years of age, were praised throughout Kyoto.
In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a student of Soui KENOU and changed his name to Soujun.
KENOU died in 1414.
Whether it was because of the death of his teacher is difficult to determine, but IKKYUU attempted suicide around that time.
In 1415 he became a student of high priest Soudon KASOU at Kyoto's Daitokuji.
He received the name IKKYUU from KASOU when he answered the Koan called Touzan's 3 Blows by saying "the treacherous path returns to the safe path; take a rest and let the rain fall, let the wind blow."
The "treacherous path" refers to the world of confusion (distracting thoughts), while the "safe path" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha).
One night in 1420 he heard the calling of a crow, and was immediately enlightened.
KASOU tried to give him a certificate of dharma transmission, but IKKYUU refused it.
It is said that KASOU laughed and called him a fool as he sent him away.
From then on he lived a crazy life of poetry, writing, and painting.
In 1428 Emperor Shoukou died without leaving behind a son; and Emperor Gohanazono from the Fushiminomiya family was enthroned.
It is said that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement was based on a recommendation from IKKYUU.
From "A chronological history of the Priest Ikkyuu of Toukai".
Actually, Yoshio IMAIZUMI says that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement had the support of the shogunate, and had nothing to do with IKKYUU's recommendation.
After the Onin War in 1474, at the order of Emperor Gotsuchimikado he was installed as chief priest (the 47th) of Daitokuji; and although he did not live in the temple, he put a lot of effort into its restoration.
The subsidiary temple Shinjuan was built with IKKYUU as its founder.
He was close to the emperor, and was also loved by the people.
He died at Shuuonan in 1481, at the age of 88.
It is reported that on his deathbed he said, "I don't want to die."
Shuuonan, commonly called "Ikkyuuji", is located in the Takigi area of Kyoutanabe City in Kyoto.
The ruined Myoushouji temple was restored by IKKYUU in 1456.
His grave is at Shuuonan and is called Jiyoutou, but is managed by the Imperial Household Agency as an imperial tomb, calling it the grave of prince Soujun, son of Emperor Gokomatsu, based on the stories about his lineage.
For that reason it is not open to the public.
Free and uninhibited, he was said to have many eccentricities.
The following anecdotes have been passed on.
